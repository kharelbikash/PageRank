http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/05/ebola-journalist-arrested-over-criticism-sierra-leone-government-response <p>A journalist in Sierra Leone who has criticised the government’s handling of the Ebola outbreak was allegedly beaten then jailed under emergency laws meant to help bring the epidemic under control.</p> <p>David Tam Baryoh, a high-profile radio journalist whose reports have often needled officials, is being detained at the maximum-security Pademba Road prison in the capital Freetown. His popular weekly programme, Monologue, was taken off air mid-show last week as he interviewed an opposition party spokesman who criticised the president’s alleged intentions to run for a third term. During that show Baryoh also questioned arrests made in <a href="http://www.newctzen.com/index.php/11-news/986-24-hour-curfew-in-kono">Kono, an eastern district put under curfew in October</a> when a dispute between youths and police over a suspected case of Ebola <a href="https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/541c1101e4b0e32cb9c53a41/1212840">degenerated into gunfire and rioting</a>.</p> <p>Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia between them now account for nearly 5,000 Ebola deaths, and have all declared states of emergency as cases continue to climb. But months into the outbreak, the growing epidemic has swept in a belated influx of international aid as well as political and social tensions as governments’ popularity ratings take a battering.</p> <p>Legislators in Sierra Leone threatened to gag the media over their coverage of the controversial allocation in September of 60m leones (£8,620) to each MP to boost Ebola awareness in their constituencies. In Liberia, the hardest-hit country, police last month used batons and whips to disperse protesters as lawmakers debated a request to extend president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s powers beyond the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/liberia-suspends-elections-ebola-outbreak">already sweeping ones accorded by the state of emergency declared in August</a>.</p> <p>Sierra Leone’s state of emergency empowers president Ernest Bai Koroma to arrest any person without a court order. An executive order to arrest Baryoh was signed by the president, chief superintendent Ibrahim Koroma told Reuters. “The powers were derived from the Ebola emergency regulations the country is currently under,” he said, without detailing the charges against the journalist or specifying the length of his detention.</p> <p>Local journalists said they fear a crackdown as they seek to keep on top of hundreds of millions of aid coming in. Residents, journalists and an official told the Guardian that trucks carrying food aid were sometimes parked outside quarantine cordons, which intended recipients couldn’t cross. The food was then looted by those meant to be distributing it. Burial teams have repeatedly gone on strike over unpaid hazard allowances.</p> <p>“People are feeling enraged because you can imagine you’ve lost two or three members of your family, and then someone comes knocking on your door with a bar of soap. That’s the only aid really filtering down to a lot of people,” a security adviser said.</p> <p>Almost a third of the amount pledged by the European Union will come from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/23/uk-aid-ebola-epidemic-sierra-leone-eu-david-cameron">Britain’s £205m aid package</a>. Much of that has been channelled through established NGOs, or is handled directly by Britain, such as a UK-funded medical facility that opened its doors on Wednesday after British troops worked round-the-clock to construct it in eight weeks.</p> <p>But some inevitably disappears into government coffers in a nation that <a href="http://www.transparency.org/country#SLE">ranks 119 out of 177 on global corruption indexes</a>, while hundreds of thousands of pounds have also come from wealthy local donors, government supporters or multinationals. Last year, a number of top health officials were indicted for siphoning about $500,000 from a childhood immunisation fund sponsored by the Gates Foundation.</p> <p>“It’s a very tough time for journalists. A lot of money is moving around the country and we as journalists have to do our jobs and make sure it is being properly allocated,” said an local investigative reporter speaking on condition of anonymity.</p> <p>An associate said Baryoh was beaten some time between police storming his office on Sunday and his being examined by a prison doctor on Monday. A source who visited Baryoh in prison said he was unable to stand properly, and clutched at his knees before tottering to the ground. Baryoh suffers from high blood pressure, and is struggling with the crowded conditions of a jail that houses about four times its capacity of 324 inmates, the source added.</p> <p>“When the police arrested him in his office, there were six armed ones and a couple of plain clothes. They were really rough with him and threw away his blood pressure tablets,” a close friend of Baryoh’s told the Guardian. “A doctor has said he really needs to be in a hospital but officials made some excuse about no visitors because of Ebola, and shooed [the doctor] away.” Officials declined to comment on the allegations.</p> <p>Peter Nkanga, West Africa representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: “Sierra Leone’s genuine state of emergency means that critical thinking and public debate are more important than ever. Locking away journalists without charge helps nobody.”</p> <p>Other reporters have been imprisoned in the notorious Pademba facility recently. <a href="http://en.rsf.org/sierra-leone-editorial-criticizing-president-24-10-2013,45375.html]">Jonathan Leigh and Bai Bai Sesay were held for four months after publishing an article which criticised the president</a>. All but one of the 26 charges against them were dropped upon their release in January.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/05/archbishop-war-ebola-reporters <p>The archbishop of Canterbury has praised the “extraordinary value” of frontline reporters covering overseas conflicts and the Ebola crisis for shining a light on “this darkening world”.</p> <p>Justin Welby said foreign correspondents and war reporters were a “God-given calling to inspire others to serve our common humanity” and helped challenge people’s complacency that what happened elsewhere in the world “did not matter”.</p> <p>Welby, delivering the sermon <a href="http://www.stbrides.com/news/2014/11/archbishop-to-attend-service-of-commemoration-for-fallen-journalists.html">at the annual journalists commemorative service </a>at St Bride’s Church in London’s Fleet Street, reflected on a year in which journalists faced an unprecedented threat from Islamic State (Isis) and the danger of reporting the Ebola outbreak from west Africa.</p> <p>“We live in a world where it feels as though the darkness is falling ever more severely on whole swathes and regions and in which the light of the news often seems to go out,” he said.</p> <p>“There are whole areas where there is fighting that is forgotten because there is so much of it, whole areas which depend on the likes of James Foley and Steven Sotloff [the US journalists murdered after being kidnapped by Isis in Syria] to show some light on what is happening.”</p> <p>Welby said frontline reporters were the “lookouts who stand on the watchtower” and paid a “profound cost” for what they saw, “sometimes deeply hurt mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, even killed doing it”.</p> <p>“It is right and essential that we give thanks for those who witness, who unlock the covers of the wells of compassion that can become available, who challenge the complacency in which some people suggest that we can live in our own country as though the rest of the world did not matter,” he said.</p> <p>He said his experience of conflicts and meeting war correspondents “leads me to suggest, controversially, that it is just a little bit possible that they are not all entirely saintly at every minute of the day.</p> <p>“But there is an old saying in the church ... the fact that the priest is all messed up does not mess up the sacrament.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="8c9fdb188a922ea88a5e9da946e77277a29a3844"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415208173041/4d025de9-ba8b-466a-bd93-4159b6b66afc-460x276.jpeg" alt="Archbishop of Canterbury during a service for journalists killed while reporting on the front line, at St Brides Church in London.

We ask how we got into this situation in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, why the World Health Organisation was so slow to respond, and what needs to happen in future to prevent a similar disaster.</p> <p>There have now been 13,703 officially registered Ebola cases and around 5,000 deaths, although it is estimated the true figure may be two to three times higher.</p> <p>In Liberia a slowdown has recently been noted with fewer burials and some empty beds in treatment centres, but experts say the numbers could easily rise again. Drug and vaccine trials are being expedited and will start in the outbreak countries in December, but the epidemic is still far from under control.</p> <p>I asked David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and head of the Centre on Global Health Security at Chatham House what part the poor healthcare system of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea had played in the epidemic.</p> <p><strong>DH</strong> Well, I think it’s important to look at other countries which also have very weak health systems, such as Zaire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo today, and other countries where Ebola has occurred. The difference is not so much that it’s in urban areas with weak infrastructure, it’s that it wasn’t stopped when it was still rural.</p> <p>In rural areas where there’s better community organisation, village elders, village chiefs, traditional systems which help people better understand the cause of the disease and how to prevent spread, where the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies can work very freely to transport dead bodies and to transport patients and to spray the environment where patients have been held and also where contact tracing is easier and patient identification and isolation is also easier, it’s more easy to stop an outbreak and all previous outbreaks have been stopped in rural areas.</p> <p>These outbreaks did enter capital cities, an outbreak in 1995 in Zaire at that time entered Kinshasa, a city of 9 million, but the government was ready to jump on it right away with support from international partners and it didn’t spread.</p> <p>Now in west Africa it’s in countries which have really struggled to rebuild their health systems in urban areas and in rural areas, and where there’s not so much trust as there is in these rural communities and as a result it’s been very difficult to stop the outbreak in these countries.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> And are such outbreaks predictable? Should we have been able to see the Ebola crisis?</p> <p><strong>DH</strong> When an Ebola outbreak occurs it’s caused by a random event; it’s an event that no one can predict. It’s an event that gets the virus which is in an animal or in a bat into a human and then within the human population it spreads from person to person. This is non predictable, although many people would like to be able to predict using genetic sequences or other information about organisms that are carried by animals, to date it’s not been possible to predict when and where an outbreak will occur.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> There was a time when it was said that infectious diseases were all but conquered. Will we ever get to that position do you think?</p> <p><strong>DH</strong> Well I think that was a premature statement back in the 1960s and it’s clear that we never will get to that position, because even if we do deal with all infectious diseases and have drugs and vaccines there’s still the problem of antimicrobial resistance to the drugs we use to treat them. There’s the problem of mutation and escape from protection from one vaccine, a whole series of things that will maintain infectious diseases as a problem, but hopefully in developing countries not the problem that it is today where over a third of the population dies from infectious disease.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> So with no predictability and the certain occurrence of infectious disease we can only try to best prepare ourselves and vulnerable countries by mobilising organisations and governments to put in place strong healthcare systems, something which we have failed to do.</p> <p>I spoke to Mohga Kamal-Yanni, senior health and policy adviser at Oxfam.</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> It’s a complicated situation really, but if you have had a good health system with trained health workers I think we would have picked up the outbreak earlier and dealt with it earlier, but the fact that particularly the three countries have very weak health systems, very few doctors for the population they have, and they’re not trained, really made it very difficult to control the spread.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> That would be the case throughout other countries in west Africa too I’m assuming?</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> Yes, it is. I mean if you look at Sierra Leone for example, the population of Sierra Leone is 6 million, then you have 136 doctors for the 6 million, the likelihood is that the majority of them will be in the capital and major cities and then you have rural areas where the spread happened with hardly any doctors. In Liberia we have 51 doctors for a population of 4.4 million people.</p> <p>Neighbouring countries will be more or less the same, you know, hovering round these figures, and also it’s not just the sheer number of health workers, but it’s also their training and it’s also where they are. Like Nigeria for example, they controlled Ebola because the patient who had Ebola was in a big city, you had a hospital, you had a lab, you had a doctor who knew what they were doing, while if it was a rural area then we, you know, it would be out of control.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> I presume in a rural area you could quite easily miss Ebola couldn’t you, because you’d have people turning up with fever, you’d then have people dying in a fairly horrible way, but it wouldn’t necessarily mean that a doctor who knew what it was would see it.</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> Yeah, exactly, because in rural areas we have less numbers of health workers and they’re not trained to diagnose Ebola. I mean the fact is this is the first time we have Ebola in west Africa, so it’s a new disease, it’s unknown for these people. You know, once we, like the country or WHO, somebody recognises here is an Ebola infection coming in this country then we don’t have the people to train or to diagnose Ebola, we don’t have the labs where you can send samples and actually get an accurate diagnosis and you don’t have the facility to look to isolate the patient and look after it, we don’t have the gear for the health workers to protect themselves. So it’s a lot more than just the number of health workers, which are important, but also other parts of the health system are not there, or are very weak anyway.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> So what are the risks? Professor Heymann again.</p> <p><strong>DH</strong> Well, in a world where there’s an infectious disease in one country with globalisation the whole world is vulnerable to that infectious disease, so this disease could spread anywhere. What’s important is that all countries have in place a system that will enable their general practitioners or their primary healthcare staff to know when a fever comes in from West Africa, what to do to determine whether or not this person might have Ebola, to get the testing done and to isolate them if there’s Ebola.</p> <p>And at the same time hospitals must be prepared with the protective equipment and other supplies necessary to make sure that it doesn’t spread in hospitals and cause community outbreaks by leaving hospitals with health workers into the community.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> I asked Mohga whether very extensive improvements to health systems are needed.</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> Yes, and we must really remember that OK, this time it’s Ebola, it did surprise the whole world because it never happened in west Africa, it was always the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, and now a totally different strain. We don’t know what will happen tomorrow, we don’t know what else is around the corner in terms of other viruses and other infections and all that, on top of the current health situation, you know, the current disease profile you’ve got these outbreaks.</p> <p>So it does definitely need a new way or a different way of thinking, not just at a national level but also at a global level. And a few days ago, the president of Liberia, she called for the donors to help them by investing in strengthening the health system over a long time. And as you know, a health system, you can’t just press a button and then you have doctors and nurses, you have to invest years in education which is not health systems, that’s education, so that you have the people whom you can train to be healthcare managers, planners, financial officers, on top of doctors and nurses and lab technicians and midwives and community health workers and all that.</p> <p>Once the outbreak is controlled, OK, how do we build on what we learned from the outbreak, you know, all these community workers that are being trained now to deal with it, how we can get these people to be part of the health system and to improve their ability. Meantime while we’re training other health workers, while we are building rural health units and small hospitals in towns, you know, like a referral centre, while we’re building information systems.</p> <p>So it really needs good planning and a good political commitment for long term, so we need governments and donors to say here is the five years’ plan or even 10 years’ plan if we can for the health system, let’s say in Sierra Leone. We will do that in year one, in year two, in year three, it will cost that amount, Sierra Leone can mobilise that amount of money and then the rest should come from donors and then so and so will provide the technical assistance to help them to go through it.</p> <p>If we don’t do this really good concrete planning and concrete financial assistance for the countries then the worry is that once Ebola goes from the headlines then we’re back to square one until we have the next outbreak.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> So when it comes to the World Health Organisation it is said that mistakes were made, that they were too slow in their response. Do you think that’s true and if so, what was the reason for it?</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> To be honest, I think everybody was slow, including the WHO. Now for the WHO there’s like a complicated set of reasons, I mean one thing for the slowness of everybody is, “what, Ebola in west Africa?” And so it’s like strange and somehow it took everybody time to react.</p> <p>For the WHO itself there’s a number of reasons. One is the funding of the WHO which is not a sudden thing, it’s been a problem simmering for the past oh, many, many years and funding WHO is a problem in two ways. One, the quantity of funding, the whole budget for the WHO is like the budget of a big hospital, say in the UK or in the US so it’s not gigantic funding, it’s like funding one hospital. So that amount has not increased as the responsibility of the WHO and the problems with global health have become more complicated and more demanding on the WHO. So the absolute amount of funding is a problem.</p> <p>But the other thing is how that funding is given to the WHO, so over the years earmarked funding has been increasing at the expense of general budget support. So donors pick the best countries, and others, they pick up the programmes or the departments that they like and they fund them, so you have more money in a particular department or in a particular function and nothing next door.</p> <p>And part of this next door was the global health security, so the funding for picking up outbreaks and dealing with outbreaks has decreased and therefore the number of experts in these areas have decreased, people just either walked out or they were sacked.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> And indeed the world seems to be been jolted awake to this shocking situation. At the recent World Bank-IMF meeting, Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, said that this was clearly an instance when donors must rally round, and that the UN estimates it will take around $1bn to stop the outbreak.</p> <p>The three leaders of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone pleaded for speedy action. Here is President Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone.</p> <p><strong>EBK</strong> The general international response has up to this moment been slower than the rate of transmission of the disease. This slower than the virus response needs to change. I hereby seek the acceleration of the translation of commitments to physical facts on the ground. That is what is urgently needed now, commitments on paper and commitments during meetings are good, but commitments as physical facts on the ground are best.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> And UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon made clear the urgent need for the injection of finances from donors worldwide.</p> <p><strong>BK-M</strong> Cases are growing exponentially. We need at least, as I said, a 20-fold surge in assistance – mobile laboratories, vehicles, helicopters, protective equipment, trained medical personnel and medevac capabilities. We must work together to provide the best standard of care for each individual or things will get worse before they get better. How much worse depends on us, the international community. So to all who have pledged I say today please deliver now, and for those who have yet to pledge I saw today please do so soon. That’s my urgent appeal.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> I asked Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director general for health systems and innovation at the WHO, whether she felt shortages of money had affected the organisation’s response to the Ebola outbreak.</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> Well certainly, because over the past years and since the end of a pandemic, if I may say where the teams which were involved in outbreak response and pandemic preparedness at that time before the pandemic have been quite well resourced but in the aftermath of a pandemic there has been certainly shortages of funds there and these teams have been decimated if I may say. So we have not had as much operational capacity as we have had a decade ago, let’s say.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> So what needs to happen in the future, both in the countries and also at the WHO? You need stronger healthcare systems clearly in countries like Sierra Leone don’t you?</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> Yes absolutely, this is something which is very important and we are working on it. Also you know that the World Health Organisation is promoting upon request of the member states universal health coverage and to be able to work towards universal health coverage you need to have decent and functional health systems.</p> <p>So we need also to integrate a bit more the different parts of health systems because when you look at experts or the people working in time of peace if I may say they see their health system as the one who does vaccination and surgery and taking care of mother and child health and you have the other part of the health system which is the one which is seen by the people who do infectious disease. And there has always been pressure that actually the health system which responds to infectious disease is not the same, whereas it is the same and in countries there are only so many people who are dealing with that.</p> <p>So what we need to do and the change that we need to make I think when we talk to a country about health systems is to have this integration saying all these pieces belong to the same system, so if you try to reinforce health systems for universal health coverage you need also to make sure that in doing this you also reinforce them in order to be able to detect infectious disease and to be able to control outbreaks.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> I presume that means more physicians, more nurses, more facilities as well doesn’t it?</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> It does, but it does also mean more surveillance. You know there’s a lot of things that can be done in the health systems, also not only by doctors and nurses, you can have mid-level and lower-level cadres or technicians who can do quite a lot of this work also. So we have to rethink the health systems that we have.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> It’s going to be a massive rebuilding project. I heard somebody estimating that just to restore Liberia’s health system would cost something like $2bn or something enormous.</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> Yes, these numbers are just appalling when you think about it.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> Yes. Do you think that the money and the willpower will be there to do this?</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> Well I hope so because as you know quite often whenever the limelight has gone somewhere else then promises are forgotten and pledges are not always followed by action, but I really hope that it will not be the case. You know, it’s not only when we discuss about rebuilding the health systems in Liberia and Guinea and Sierra Leone, it’s not only rebuilding them because they were really crappy so you don’t want to rebuild them, you need to build them differently.</p> <p>You see in low income countries when they make progress they don’t always use the same tools as we have been using in high income countries, for example, e-health and everything which is to information and communication technology is something that some of them are able to use fantastically to remedy for the small number of competent doctors and also the fact that they have remote areas which are very poorly served. So the rebuilding needs to be with other ingredients, not what we had before.</p> <p><strong>DH</strong> Certainly what we need to do is make sure that the WHO has the resources right and its priorities right. You know, even if there’s a decrease in resources in an organisation the prioritisation is what’s important, sun-setting or stopping certain programmes that aren’t a priority and moving resources to others that might be a priority.</p> <p>In that prioritisation process it’s always difficult because there are interests of various countries for their goals and their desires and their needs and it’s very difficult to come to a consensus on what really is a priority and what isn’t, so many times all activities remain but just at a decreased level of funding.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> Would you like to see a stronger World Health Organisation?</p> <p><strong>DH</strong> Yes, I think the World Health Organisation is incredibly important in the world and if it can be strengthened to do the job as it has done in the past then I think it’s a very important organisation to maintain. There’s no other organisation that looks out for the health of developing countries as does WHO.</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> It’s that worry about once it goes from the headlines what will happen, it will be just the WHO speaking in an empty space because once the media starts talking about something else, whether it’s health or I don’t know, Afghanistan or Iraq or something then governments in the rich countries start talking about that thing and forget about Ebola, and it’s nice to forget about it because if you forget about it you don’t have any commitment or you just put a little amount of money and that’s it, you know. Wash your hands, and that’s what we were worried about, we were worried about the donor’s community washing their hands from west Africa until the next stage.</p> <p>And the other thing that we’re worried about now is that the focus is on the three countries that are affected, but it doesn’t seem to be donor’s help going into the neighbouring countries where there’s a threat. I mean now that there is a case in Mali they have the time to prepare now but I don’t know it they have the support, whether it’s support technically or whether it’s with gear and material, staff or money.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> So who would actually take the lead with this? Who could go to say, Mali, and say we will help you put in all the infrastructure and so on that you need to prevent this happening? Is that going to be, again it won’t be the WHO will it, it has to be the donors because they have the money, they have the ability to help, but who would do it?</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> Actually, the WHO is trying to help some of these countries with whatever they have, I mean they do have country people. The UN has set up this system of coordination and that should be working. Whether that system would take the lead in talking with the donors and saying right okay, you know, maybe France would help Senegal, maybe I don’t know, the UK would help Côte d’Ivoire or somebody else. So that UN Ebola response coordination can take the lead in organising the donors around supporting the countries.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> The need for change may be there, but how hopeful are organisations such as Oxfam that it will happen and that both governments and the WHO will take responsibility for seeing it through.</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> I’m not sure to be honest, I’m not sure if member states really took notice of what’s going on and are really taking their responsibility for that situation rather than just blaming the WHO. I think that’s the critical thing, will the member states, particularly the donors, particularly the ones that have money, you know, because developing countries are interested in funding the WHO but they don’t have the money to do it. The people who don’t seem to be interested in empowering the WHO, if you like, are the ones who have the money, so you’ve got this paradoxical situation.</p> <p>And just remember, this funding, the total budget of the WHO rather than earmarked, I mean basically it doesn’t mean that you’re giving the funding and say right OK, you run with it, do whatever you like, it’s not like that, because the WHO is one, as you know it’s probably unique in the global system, in the UN system, in terms of it’s governed by its members. So through the member states via the World Health Assembly actually decide on the plan for the WHO so for the next three years you’re going to do this, that and the other. But then the budget doesn’t match the plan.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> Do we need better leadership at the WHO, and surely it should be their role to push through or to assist with the reconstruction of healthcare in these affected countries and to bolster them? So if it has to be done, if we have to rebuild the healthcare systems of Sierra Leone and Liberia and Guinea it should be the WHO that pushes that ahead surely?</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> The WHO is not an implementing agency so they’re not going to build the health system in Sierra Leone or in any country, but they have this advocacy, if you like policy function, of saying why this is important, how you could do it, guiding the country and doing it and making it a serious global issue, if you like. For that, the WHO needs to have the capacity to do this, yes it does need very strong leadership to do that, but don’t forget the role of the donors, the WHO’s always kind of taking it easy with the big donors because they’re the ones who give the money.</p> <p>Until that changes, it’s very difficult, you know, you put the leadership in a difficult situation, whoever is there, if they speak loudly do they upset the donor then they might be threatened by not being funded or more earmarked and less budget. So it’s a very tricky situation, but we certainly need strong leadership that can stand against all the donors’ commercial and other interests.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> And did Dr Kierny think there is a need to strengthen the WHO?</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> Absolutely, that’s going to be very important also, certainly, and I think also we need to understand how to better ourselves, get organised, but clearly the fact that we receive not enough funding but also the money that we receive is quite often highly earmarked so this is that we receive money which is to do one project or another project and cannot be used for anything else.</p> <p>So the way we are financed and the way we operate has been a subject of much debate by our member states for many years, so I hope that this and other elements will help them think of how they can make sure that the organisation is fit for purpose.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> In a way, that discussion needs to happen now doesn’t it, while the world’s attention is on this particular crisis?</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> Absolutely.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> That brings us to the end of this edition of the Global development podcast.

http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/04/ebola-sierra-leone-small-scale-mining-sector-catastropic-consequences <p>Ebola is having catastrophic economic consequences for Sierra Leone, where the disease is running rampant. </p> <p>The country, together with the two other Mano River Union states, Liberia and Guinea, are presently in economic paralysis. Despite being natural resource-rich countries, inflation, food prices and currency exchange rates have soared, international investors have fled, and industries have come to a grinding halt. World Bank estimates suggest that the Ebola outbreak could <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/publication/the-economic-impact-of-the-2014-ebola-epidemic-short-and-medium-term-estimates-for-west-africa">cost the West African economy $32.6bn</a> (£20.3bn) by the end of 2015, unless the epidemic is rapidly contained.</p> <p>In Sierra Leone, the macro-economic impacts of the crisis came into sharp focus two weeks ago, when the country’s second largest iron ore producer, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/london-mining-fight-ebola-sierra-leone-goes-bust">London Mining, went into administration</a>. The London-listed company was one of the country’s largest employers, providing jobs for 1,400 local people at its mine in Marampa, and contributing an estimated 10% to GDP. While the company has been hard hit by a 40% drop in the global price of iron ore, it seems that the disruption caused by the Ebola epidemic served as the final nail in the coffin.</p> <p>The Ebola crisis is having <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/28/ebola-africa-symptom-failing-economic-system-west-deforestation">devastating consequences</a> on Sierra Leone’s macro-economy, but it is also having far reaching knock-on effects at the micro-level, suppressing informal livelihood opportunities for poor people. This is particularly the case for those who are dependent on artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) – low-tech, labour-intensive mineral extraction and processing activities that generate disposable income for hundreds of thousands of families in an employment-constrained economy.</p> <p>With many parts of the country in effective quarantine and regional trade routes blocked off, there are enormous logistical challenges for ASM. It is Sierra Leone’s second largest employer after agriculture and provides a livelihood for an estimated 200,000-300,000 individuals and their families. It is also an activity that is characterised by a high degree of mobility, and it often takes place in confined spaces where there is poor hygiene. While the spread of Ebola has forced many ASM operators to abandon mining altogether, tight border controls implemented to halt the spread of disease have also made activities within the ASM sector increasingly difficult.</p> <p>ASM does not merely generate income for poor people, but it interlocks closely with a host of other downstream and ancillary activities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yw2pEcauGt8">that drive the rural economy</a>. This micro-economy is defined by seasonal migratory labour streams, where individuals straddle different productive activities throughout the year, by moving freely between various geographic locations. </p> <p>Artisanal diamond operators often combine farming and mining, with mining being undertaken predominantly in the dry season when river levels are low, and farming being carried out mainly during the rainy season. The income generated from diamond mining is frequently reinvested into farming, or the expansion of cash crops, such as coffee, cocoa and kola nuts. </p> <p> Restrictions on the movement of people have severely curtailed both artisanal diamond and gold mining. Before the crisis, artisanal gold mining, being a female-dominated activity, provided a steady and reliable income for women. Gold revenue contributed to the cost of essential household expenses, including food, clothes, school fees and books, and family medical costs. </p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="85316dc1f9784c4213604b1c68838252ef084122"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/4/1415100796133/71c0e0eb-df28-46e8-9bcb-e32c06aba293-460x276.jpeg" alt="Women mining gold in Kono, Sierra Leone" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Women mining gold in Kono, Sierra Leone.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Roy Maconachie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These earnings also provided women with the necessary ‘start-up’ capital to create farming associations, revive agricultural labour clubs and rebuild trading networks that were rendered dysfunctional during the war. This prominent gender dimension to the sector suggests that artisanal gold mining is, in normal circumstances, an important vehicle for alleviating poverty and enhancing food security, as it puts income directly into the hands of women. </p> <p>Restrictions on movement are not only affecting producers, but also buyers, many of whom travel from as far as Guinea to do business. Reports indicate that sourcing patterns are also being affected. Buyers in Surat, India, where an estimated 80% of the world’s diamonds are cut and polished, have stopped sending their traders to West Africa and have even <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Ebola-outbreak-dulls-diamond-industry/articleshow/41906802.cms">returned parcels originating from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea</a>, over fears of the disease.</p> <p>Everyday life in rural Sierra Leone is a challenge at the best of times, with many people in the alluvial mining areas experiencing some of the worst poverty in the country. While Ebola has had a devastating effect on the mining sector – both large-scale, like London Mining, and small-scale – the predominant national response to restrict mobility has been particularly damaging to the ASM sector and the livelihoods of those it supports. </p> <p>It has had an impact upon the day-to-day survival of hundreds of thousands of people within the gold and diamondiferous areas of the country. This indicates that managing the risk of further contagion is a doubly challenging task, given that the trade networks and population mobility that define the rural economy are also potential pathways to spread the disease further. </p> <p>Ebola control must involve a process of rapid identification of cases, followed by removal and isolation of those infected for treatment. Public health education is also key. But a truly holistic approach to containing the disease, without cutting the lifelines that support the livelihoods of Sierra Leone’s rural inhabitants, must first start with a detailed understanding from all agencies involved, of the country’s rural landscapes and an appreciation of the micro-economic patterns and processes that are central to rural society.</p> <p><em>Roy Maconachie is senior lecturer in international development at the University of Bath</em></p> <p><strong>Read more stories like this:</strong><br /></p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/28/ebola-africa-symptom-failing-economic-system-west-deforestation">Ebola is a product of a destructive and exploitative global economic system </a></li> <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/03/developing-nations-lose-100bn-tax-revenue-g20-reforms-avoidance">Developing nations lose $100bn in tax revenue each year - will G20 reforms help?</a></li> <li><strong>Brought to you by Business Call to Action</strong>: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/31/from-emerging-to-multinational-leaders-shaping-new-models-to-meet-the-bop">From emerging to multinational: leaders shaping new models to meet the BoP </a><br /></li> </ul> <p><em><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/role-business-development">The role of business in development</a> hub is funded by Business Call to Action.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/03/maine-nurse-final-week-ebola-monitoring <p>The nurse who challenged Maine’s quarantine policy for healthcare workers returning from west Africa must monitor her health for one more week, but is free to leave her home under a deal reached on Monday. </p> <p>The state of Maine and lawyers for the nurse, Kaci Hickox, agreed to make permanent the terms of a temporary court order issued <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/31/maine-nurse-ebola-guidelines-judge-lifts-order">on Friday</a> by judge Charles C LaVerdiere, the chief judge for the state’s district courts.</p> <p>“It’s excellent,” Steve Hyman, one of Hickox’s lawyers, said. The agreement brings to a close the first legal attempt by a state to enforce a quarantine policy on healthcare workers returning from Ebola-affected region of west Africa. </p> <p>Hickox, 33, must monitor her health and report any <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola">Ebola symptoms</a> until her 21-day incubation period ends at 11.59pm on 10 November. She is not, however, restricted from leaving her home and visiting public places. She also must coordinate travel with health officials so her monitoring isn’t interrupted.</p> <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/maine">Maine</a> officials had attempted to bar Hickox from public gatherings and force her to stay 3ft from others, but on Friday the judge lifted those requirements, even though they abided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.</p> <p>While Hickox is free from quarantine, her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur, with whom she lives in Fort Kent, is keeping away from the University of Maine campus where he is a nursing student. </p> <p>Wilbur told reporters he was asked to stay away from campus while Hickox is under monitoring, but the university said the decision was reached mutually.</p> <p>Ray Phinney, the associate dean of student life and development at the University of Maine at Fort Kent, said the decision to stay away is voluntary, and that the school is willing to reconsider the agreement. He said the university worked to accommodate Wilbur, offering him the option to take his classes online. </p> <p>Phinney said the decision was made to ensure students feel safe on campus, which he described as small. “We understand the science behind [the Ebola virus], but also that there are legitimate fears among communities,” he said.</p> <p>Speaking to <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/hickox-clarifies-her-self-quarantine-plan-n239561">NBC’s Meet the Press </a>on Sunday, Hickox said Wilbur should be allowed to return to school, as he poses no threat to others. The agreement remained in effect on Monday.</p> <p>Still, Hickox said she was sympathetic to those in her town, and implied that she would stay away from public places even though she is not restricted from doing so. </p> <p>“I will not go into town, into crowded public places,” she told NBC. “You know, I have had a few friends come visit me in my home, and that’s absolutely fantastic.”</p> <p>Hickox became the center of a contentious debate on how to treat healthcare workers returning from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone after she was detained at Newark airport in New Jersey. Despite testing negative for Ebola and displaying no symptoms, she was kept in an isolation tent at an area hospital for some days before Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, agreed to her release. </p> <p>She returned to her home in Fort Kent, a small town near the Canadian border, where state officials attempted to place her under quarantine. Hickox refused, even threatening to defy the quarantine order if it was not lifted. She left her home for the first time on Thursday.</p> <p>New York and New Jersey’s mandatory 21-day quarantine policy inspired similar requirements in several states across the US, despite widespread criticism from the medical establishment, the White House and the UN.</p> <p>Hickox and her lawyers argued that the state-mandated quarantine measure was not based on science, and infringed on her civil liberties. </p> <p>Hyman, Hickox’s lawyer, said he hopes other states weighing restrictive quarantine policies on healthcare workers take note of the judge’s decision, but he said he is not optimistic.<br /></p> <p>“We are troubled that other states seem to be mimicking New York and New Jersey and have imposed restrictions that make no medical sense,” he said.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/nov/03/profiting-from-ebola-is-it-immoral-to-invest-in-companies-that-benefit-from-pandemics <p>An epidemic jumps from country to country, propelled thousands of miles over land and sea by the ease of modern travel. Researchers at pharmaceutical companies are racing to find a vaccine, a cure, a treatment. <br /></p> <p>You invest in their stocks, just helping to save lives. You are one of the good guys, adding resources to the fight. Right? But you are also betting on more and more people getting sick and on getting a pretty rich return for yourself.</p> <p>This is a moral quandary. People profit from bad events. It happens all the time. We all sneer at war profiteers, but entire economies benefited in the economic boom following the second world war. Defense stocks, like <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/22/investing/defense-stocks-isis-bounce/">Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, hit record highs</a> last month when the terrorist group Isis stepped up its threat. </p> <p>Turn on <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ebola-stocks-mostly-higher-after-virus-confirmed-in-new-york-2014-10-24">any</a> <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102118006">financial</a> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/lakeland-reports-1-million-hazmat-suit-orders-2014-10">news</a> <a href="http://online.barrons.com/articles/investing-and-ebola-the-hazmat-trade-1413610266">these days</a>, and the talk is how to profit from Ebola. Stocks in vaccines, experimental new treatments, even hazmat suits are showing speculative pops. Companies you’ve never heard of before, such as Sarepta and Tekmira and Lakeland, are dominating attention. Morbidly, even New York City’s body bag supplier, <a href="http://nypost.com/2014/10/16/dont-say-ebola-on-the-radio-fdny-to-911-dispatchers/">Basheer Mahar of Salam International, Inc</a>, is quoted in the press assuring the city that he has “more than 100,000 bags on hand.” Business is booming.</p> <p>Let’s say you invested in a speculative small stock such as Lakeland Industries, which makes contamination suits and safety gear. You hedged your bets and put money in pharmaceutical companies developing experimental drugs, such as Sarepta, Tekmira, and BioCryst . You even threw a few dollars at DuPont and Honeywell, the behemoths of protective gear. You got in before the stocks popped in price, and settled down to ride the rise. </p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="840691b4a96913abcb86a24f239ec4b1a8469040"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/30/1414698854933/00844a31-af8e-4d56-be75-1268a7c4c218-460x276.jpeg" alt="World Health Organisation staff check a package of the experimental Ebola vaccine VSE-EBOV at a hospital in Geneva, Switzerland." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">World Health Organisation staff check a package of the experimental Ebola vaccine VSE-EBOV at a hospital in Geneva, Switzerland.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: MATHILDE MISSIONEIRO / WHO / HANDOUT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But by taking advantage in the rally in Ebola-related stocks are you worse than your friend who invests in Starbucks and Apple? Is betting more people will want a cup of coffee and a fancy new phone a more moral investment strategy than waiting for confirmed Ebola cases to rise?</p> <p>Not exactly, said three ethicists interviewed by the Guardian. </p> <p>“That’s how markets benefit society,” explains Thomas Donaldson, professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School. “Investing is wrong when I know that my investment will cause more harm than good or violate a core human value,” explained Donaldson. </p> <p>So while it may seem strange that in some indirect way these stocks are benefiting from the panic over Ebola, and perhaps news stories can be more sensitive when touting the rising stock prices or highlighting a pharmaceutical company that has an Ebola vaccine in its pipeline that no one has noticed yet, there is nothing ethically wrong in benefiting from the investment. </p> <p>The system we have in place requires private investors – you and I – to fund drug discovery. Pharmaceutical companies operate for profit. They research those drugs that will get them more revenue and a higher stock price. Whatever their motivation, pharmaceutical companies make drugs that save lives.</p> <p>Drug development is a tricky business, and an expensive one. Literally billions are spent each year on research to find new and better drugs to treat humanity’s ills. A popular estimate is that it takes $1bn (£620m) or more to discover and develop one new drug. So educate yourself well, and know that you are taking a big bet, but perhaps one that may save some lives, even if it does so indirectly simply by demonstrating which drugs and target molecules don’t work. It is one of the rare cases where a bad investment can at least still have some benefit. <br /></p> <p>So invest away. But remember, betting on any drug company can be pretty speculative. When it comes to success, only one in 10 drugs make it all the way from concept to clinic, according to some studies.</p> <p>Virologist Jonas Salk famously did not patent his polio vaccine, forgoing profits, so that it could be widely and cheaply available to the world’s population. Most of us live in a less perfect reality. <br /></p> <p>“Benevolence is a motive far superior to that of self-interest and we should encourage everyone to cultivate it,” says Donaldson. “Yet, self-interest is a more reliable basis for organising our economy and securing economic welfare.” </p> <p>And investors motivate for-profit companies to focus on whatever seems to provide the biggest return. So investing in companies because they are working on treatments for Ebola directly motivates a company to complete research on their pipeline drugs, as well as providing the capital for that research. </p> <p>It can also be argued that whatever the motivation of the investor, the end result – more funding for research or the production of protective gear – is what really matters. “For those who might be future beneficiaries, it might not matter what was the motivation.” points out Hersh Shefrin, finance professor at Santa Clara University’s Leavey school of business, whose work focuses on behavioral finance.</p> <p>Putting money into stocks that experience a pop because of the panic over Ebola and then taking your money out before the stock price drops again may be more dubious morally.<br /></p> <p>“Some people’s personal ethics will lead them to feel that it’s not right to benefit from the tragedy of others. If so, they can always identify the gain from ‘Ebola-investments’ and donate those to a worthy cause, without removing the financial incentive necessary to fight the disease”, points out Shefrin, highlighting the need to fund research into vaccines and better treatments. </p> <p>“I think most people would say it’s permissible to invest in these stocks. If one were entirely unmoved by the plight of those suffering from Ebola, that would be callous. But one might be very sad about what is happening to them, and yet glad that one’s stocks are rising.” says Roger Crisp, professor of moral philosophy, Uehiro fellow and tutor in philosophy at St Anne’s College, Oxford. </p> <p>To paraphrase Churchill, the system of for profit pharmaceutical companies and speculating investors is the worse system there is – except for all the other ones.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/02/africa-cup-of-nations-morocco-ebola <p>A decision over whether Morocco will host the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) tournament is expected on Monday after a day of meetings between the Confederation of African Football (Caf) and Moroccan authorities.</p> <p>The north African country asked for the tournament – due to begin on 17 January – <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/16/morocco-africa-cup-of-nations-ebola-withdraw" title="">to be postponed due to the risk of the spread of the Ebola virus</a> affecting western Africa.</p> <p>According to reports from the Algeria Press Service, the executive committee of the Caf met the federation’s president, Issa Hayatou, the Algerian Football Federation president, Mohamed Rauraua, and the Egyptian CAF delegate, Hani Abourida, on Sunday.</p> <p>After recommendations from the national Health Ministry and the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Moroccan Ministry of Sport had asked for the tournament to be postponed to an unspecified date.</p> <p>“Our concern is the health of Africa and, based on WHO reports and guidelines, we have to listen,” said the sports minister, Mohamed Ouzzine.</p> <p>“Zero safety does not exist but one has to take the necessary precautions so that the coming tournament will be a football feast, bringing together our African brothers. But given the current Ebola situation we don’t think such a feast can take place as expected.”</p> <p>However, the Manchester City and Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Touré, who played in his club side’s 1-0 victory over Manchester United on Sunday, believes the tournament should take place as scheduled.</p> <p>“Me, I’m not really afraid,” <a href="http://www.europe1.fr/sport/football/articles/yaya-toure-j-espere-qu-on-pourra-jouer-la-can-2277537" title="">Touré told French radio station Europe 1 on Saturday</a>. “A very strong psychosis exists about this epidemic. The CAN is very important for Africa. It needs to take place.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/02/rand-paul-temporary-halt-elective-travel-ebola-countries <p>Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, has called for the US to enact a “temporary stop” of “elective travel” for people coming from west African nations that have seen Ebola outbreaks even as he questioned the quarantine of a Maine nurse who has tested negative for the disease.</p> <p>“If you’re coming to visit your relatives, couldn’t that wait for a few months?” <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/limit-elective-travel-from-west-africa-to-curb-ebola-spread-sen-rand-paul-says/">he said on CBS’s Face the Nation</a> on Sunday. “What I’m saying is elective travel, commercial travel for people who just want to visit the United States, that really isn’t a necessity.”<br /></p> <p>“The American public sees people getting it who are fully masked and gowned and saying, ‘My goodness, I don’t think anybody should be riding on a bus or coming from Liberia to visit their aunt or uncle when they could be contagious,” he said. </p> <p>He said the ban should not apply to humanitarian aid workers. <br /></p> <p>Paul, a doctor, has come under criticism recently for other statements about Ebola that seem to contradict that of medical officials. Last month, he accused the White House of underplaying how transmissible the disease is, suggesting it was more contagious than Aids. “If someone has Ebola at a cocktail party they’re contagious and you can catch it from them,” <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/16/politics/rand-paul-ebola-aids/">he said</a> then. </p> <p>Also appearing on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, Paul told Candi Crowley quarantines for returning aid workers are “reasonable precautions” but that he was unsettled by the treatment of Kaci Hickox, the Maine nurse who battled the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, and later the Maine governor, Paul LePage, over their attempts to quarantine her.<br /></p> <p>“The libertarian in me is horrified at the idea of indefinitely detaining or detaining anyone without a trial,” Paul said.<br /></p> <p>“One of the basic rights we inherited from the English and we got from common law was the right of habeas corpus … If the king were detaining you in the Tower of London, or a governor or anybody who is detaining you, you have to have recourse to a lawyer.”<br /></p> <p>“We have to be careful of people’s civil liberties,” he said. “But I’m not saying the government doesn’t have a role in trying to prevent contagion.”</p> <p>In an interview with the Maine Sunday Telegram on Sunday, Hickox defended her fight against the quarantine and said she was hopeful others returning from west Africa would be treated more fairly. </p> <p>“I hope in six months aid workers returning back can be unnoticed,” she told the newspaper. “They won’t be in the media like I was, I hope. And they can walk into a grocery store and maybe no one even knows they were working in a country with Ebola, but one day I hope everyone can know and still smile at them in the grocery store. I know that won’t happen today.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/02/ebola-deeply-media-syria-deeply <p>The Ebola crisis has brought out the worst in some elements of the western media, prey to exaggeration, scaremongering and shock tactics.</p> <p><a href="http://www.eboladeeply.org" title="">Ebola Deeply</a>, a new single-issue website from the team behind <a href="http://www.syriadeeply.org" title="">Syria Deeply</a>, could help to rectify this situation. As with Syria Deeply, the site offers a mixture of original reporting and aggregation, from a team made up of journalists (many of them on the ground in affected countries), technologists and experts in the field.</p> <p>Lara Setrakian, a former television news correspondent for Bloomberg Television and ABC News who founded parent site <a href="http://www.newsdeeply.com" title="">News Deeply</a> in 2012, describes the company’s model as an “on ramp” for news stories.</p> <p>“There needs to be something that helps get users – readers, viewers – on-boarded to a story, understanding enough of the narrative that they can find the next piece more interesting and engaging,” Setrakian says. “When [the media] fade in and out of reporting on certain issues it becomes very hard for our audience to catch up on what happened in the space between.”</p> <p>The two sites offer a similar mixture of content, including op-ed pieces from a network of experts, maps, timelines, videos, executive summaries, aggregated news from around the world and the Syria/Ebola Files, collections of text and interactive materials designed to help readers understand the background to the current situation.</p> <p>“We see ourselves as a supplement, almost like a vitamin – vitamin Syria,” Setrakian explains. “The notion of a universal story page is very helpful for our readers and it is also just like journalism in the public service, when we were talking about radio or television, except for now it is digital.”</p> <p>This might, on the face of it, sound like a reaction to the failings of mainstream media. But Setrakian believes the problem is more rudimentary. “It is not the fault of any one news organisation. It is simply the systematic outcome of general-interest news reporting and a very complex world,” she says. “Some of the news coverage [of Ebola] has definitely stoked hysterical fears. But it is just the nature of the story that is so frightening. Even the most straight-forward news coverage is going to stoke fears.”</p> <p>The origins of News Deeply lie in Setrakian’s experience as a Middle East correspondent for ABC News. She loved the job, she says, but became aware of a systemic gap in the linear reporting that mainstream news outlets produce.</p> <p>“A news piece would come and go and the story, the issue itself, would still be there,” she said. “There was still so much unaccounted for. There was only really a limited amount of information you could pack into a two or three or even seven and eight minute piece.”</p> <p>After discussing her ambitions and frustrations with Azeo Fables, a technologist with a background in startups and project management, the pair launched Syria Deeply in 2012. “People thought I was crazy – even my mother thought I was nuts. She could not compute that I left TV to start a website,” Setrakian says. “As a Middle Eastern correspondent I could not just watch this problem continue, without trying a better way of designing our coverage. Syria was too important to leave off the pages for good.”</p> <p>The site quickly found an audience – including “diplomats, Syrians, mostly living abroad, a lot of students of Middle Eastern Studies, professors, think tanks” – and scored a number of scoops, including the news that Isis had issued 11 rules for journalists in Deir Ezzor, which was picked up around the world.</p> <p>Syria Deeply generated interest in the company’s single-issue news model, which in turn led to outside suggestions for other issues that the team should cover. One of these was Ebola.</p> <p>“Syria Deeply was the proof of concept. Ebola Deeply was motivated by people telling us, ‘You need to run this model on Ebola’, which had the same information problem,” Setrakian explains.</p> <p>Fables adds: “The two things that every topic needs are a high need for service and a high opportunity for impact. Ebola Deeply’s launch had good timing because there was a lot going on and no kind of coherent narrative.”</p> <p>All this, however, needs money. Setrakian says they run the company as a “social enterprise” rather than having to rely exclusively on philanthropy.</p> <p>News Deeply does receive grants from a number of public foundations – what Setrakian calls “directed support for a single topic” – but it also makes money by creating white-label platforms for editorial projects and plans to raise funds from events and membership services.</p> <p>“We ruled out a subscription model because we don’t believe in putting this work behind a paywall,” Setrakian says. “We want it to be for public consumption.”</p> <p>Media analyst Ken Doctor compares News Deeply to the Encyclopaedia Britannica and Wikipedia. “Ebola Deeply, and its sister, Syria Deeply, take the abstract question of what would or could journalists do with a Wikipedia model and answer it,” he said.</p> <p>“Top stories, videos, maps and visuals, appropriate Twitter representations, news and views, all neatly packaged on a single page. It’s a reference point that shows you what wide and deep mean – and it’s done on shoestring.”</p> <p>The company’s next project is <a href="http://signup.arcticdeeply.org/?r=http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Farcticdeeply.org%2F&amp;ei=OdtTVNmtIePe7Ab-m4C4Dw&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5vJtWo35dDtWYAsOkEYx3X8d9mg&amp;sig2=HwED6PjzuOS3EEfnHgy-Cg&amp;bvm=bv.78677474,d.ZGU" title="">Arctic Deeply</a> – a “species-level issue” that is under-reported according to Setrakian – whose pre-launch incubation period started with a round-table event on 31 October. Other topics under consideration include Pakistan, Burma, Congo and water scarcity.</p> <p>“Myanmar has an election next year that is terribly misunderstood,” Setrakian says. “We are looking at Libya. We have looked at places where there just isn’t a spotlight.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/02/alex-crawford-sky-news-ebola-liberia <p>In early October Sky News special correspondent Alex Crawford and her crew filed a report from Liberia in which they went out with recovery teams collecting the bodies of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola" title="">dead Ebola victims</a>.</p> <p>Other news organisations, aware of the risk of catching the virus from dead bodies, gaped in awe <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1351153/ebola-crisis-alex-crawfords-special-report" title="">at the footage</a>.</p> <p>Despite their bravery the Sky team were, according to Crawford, treated as “social pariahs” by some on their return and “that was quite difficult for us all when we came back”. Like US nurse Kaci Hickox, she viewed isolation for three weeks as unnecessary, and she went straight on to covering the Oscar Pistorius trial after returning to her base in South Africa. But there were some negative comments on social media and she found people she had sat next to for months suddenly putting “wedges in between” her and them.</p> <p>She also had to cancel a family holiday with friends because they were concerned about infection, while her crew were asked by their partners to sleep in different rooms. “My colleagues were hugely cheered if anyone gave them a hug or whatever because they felt like outcasts, it was quite hard to cope,” she recalls.</p> <p>Opinion remains divided over the 21-day incubation period, with some media companies insisting their staff stick to it. Crawford convinced her bosses she did not need it: “Unless there was a reason for us to go into quarantine I said there’s no way I’m going to go three weeks in quarantine. They said ‘OK fine, no problem’.</p> <p>“It is to pacify people who are ignorant. Just because people are a bit scared – it’s ridiculous, we’re going back to the Dark Ages. If I thought I was putting other people in danger, particularly the people I love most, don’t you think I’d take those precautions? Of course I would. I’m not going to be put into three weeks of seclusion because of people who don’t even understand the bleeding facts.”</p> <p>When we spoke, the 51-year-old was still within the 21-day period and “fighting fit”. Her family “were concerned” about her going to Liberia but “people take their cue quite a lot from you” and her husband Richard, a journalist, had researched Ebola and trusted her judgment.</p> <p>Having been the correspondent who trumped rivals by riding into Tripoli with Libyan rebels in 2011 and came under fire during a counterattack by Colonel Gadaffi’s troops, was she scared going into Liberia?</p> <p>“It’s a very different ball game because it was mostly trying to contain other people’s fear. Even within my own team.” She told them she was “not at all worried” because they took “extraordinary precautions”.</p> <p>“My team were amazing, they were incredibly brave and determined – they really wanted to do it justice, they did some incredible work in some really horrendous circumstances. But were we scared of dying? No.” She adds: “There’s a real fear obviously, even when you have all the facts. But does it compare to anything like bombs going off and bullets? That’s just absolute out of control anarchy. Whereas with this I felt we had some sort of control. I felt the odds were on our side.”</p> <p>As well as wearing “claustrophobic” layers of personal protective clothing, they were advised on precautions to take by doctors and <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1347993/face-to-face-with-the-dying-in-an-ebola-centre" title="">the body recovery team they were with</a>. At times, with the heat and clothing, it felt “like you’re drowning, it feels like you’ve been waterboarded – you’re sweating and you’re anxious, everything is quite suffocating” but they were told not to touch anything or put their hands under their visors to wipe sweat off their faces.</p> <p>“The thing is, the [western] people who have got it have made mistakes. No question.” NBC News cameraman Ashoka Mukpo had Ebola but recovered, and Crawford says those westerners who get it have an advantage over those dying in Africa as they have a better diet and immune system from “decades of good living”.</p> <p>What is even more extraordinary about Crawford’s burial team report is that it was a second take. She asked the crew to go back in again (“They were like ‘What?!’”), having seen the first footage and thought “we need to go and spend more time with them because we weren’t showing what it was like to actually be them. I said I felt like [the first time] we’re just being observers. Also when you do go and do things where it’s quite a high personal risk, it’s important to do it well and you make an impact otherwise you’ve squandered an opportunity.”</p> <p>Crawford persuaded her bosses to let her return to Liberia, after filming an earlier report in the spring, because “I thought the body retrieval thing had got to be at that stage one of the most dangerous jobs ever and it hadn’t really been covered”. Sky News managers let her but were cautious. They are “acutely aware” of risks to their staff, says Crawford, since the loss of cameraman Mick Deane in Cairo in 2013. He was Sky News’s first casualty in 25 years of broadcasting and she says the number of losses over the years at other news organisations probably explains their “reticence” to do what she did.</p> <p>Crawford hopes her reports will help educate audiences about Ebola: “I think the fear in America, Britain and everywere else is out of proportion because they will get cases of Ebola, absolutely. But will it spread like it has done in Liberia? Really unlikely. You need to be alert but do you think it’s going to take over and kill half of Reading? No.”</p> <p>She says that “in the immediate future” she wants to stay in Africa - where she grew up and lives with her husband and four children – particularly as much of her three years there so far has been taken up with the Pistorius trial, which was “tragic” but “a bit like being in a continuous Big Brother thing”. Being in a courtroom made her feel “like a caged animal”. She prefers to “be out and about and smelling the air”.</p> <p>When asked if, given the kidnapping and beheading of reporters by Isis, and the deaths of other journalists in conflict zones – there is anywhere she would not go, Crawford replies: “No, I don’t think so. In fact places other people don’t go to I’m more likely to want to go to.”</p> <p>After 25 years at Sky, could she see herself working somewhere else? After a pause she answers: “Yeah, I think so. You always like to think there will be new challenges ahead. Even if I didn’t pick up those opportunities I’d hate to think there weren’t any. You’ve got to always think there’s something ahead – more challenges, more doors to kick down.”</p> <p>Having become a foreign correspondent at the age of 46, been awarded an OBE and won Royal Television Society journalist of the year four times, Crawford has become something of a role model for women in the industry. “I’m not sure I’m a particularly good role model but if it’s possible to inspire other people then that would be good, particularly women. I think quite a lot of women who are probably like me, do suffer from low self-esteem and lack of confidence and come from the point of view of ‘We don’t really deserve this’ and all sorts of things that men probably don’t feel guilty about.”</p> <p>She says when she first wanted to become a correspondent she thought “once I started having a family that virtually put the kibosh on it” as she could not see any other women doing it.</p> <p>“If that’s broken down the barriers with employers as well as young women who are thinking ‘I’d better get it all done now because once I have children it’ll all be over’ then hopefully that’s a good thing.”</p> <p>She adds: “It’s time to take off those blinkers of men who think that women who are just entering the child-bearing years shouldn’t be taken on, or <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2014/oct/26/older-women-news-current-affairs" title="">those who are of a certain age with children shouldn’t be taken on</a>. I’m probably now entering the time when they probably think I’m thinking I must be winding down. If anyone is thinking that they shouldn’t be.</p> <p>“If I was a bloke I’m just reaching my peak now. In America they have a totally different approach to older women working in broadcasting. It’s time Britain woke up.”</p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></p> <p><strong>Age </strong>51</p> <p><strong>Education </strong>St John’s Convent, Kitwe, Zambia; Chisipite Junior and Senior schools, Harare, Zimbabwe; Cobham Hall school, Kent; Open University.</p> <p><strong>Career 1981 </strong>trainee,<strong> </strong>Thompson Regional Newspapers - apprenticeship at Wokingham Times <strong>1980</strong> reporter and producer BBC Radio Nottingham, reporter and sub-editor, BBC radio and television London <strong>1988</strong> producer, TV-am <strong>1989</strong> producer, reporter and correspondent, Sky News <strong>2005</strong> Asia correspondent <strong>2010</strong> special correspondent</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/02/north-korea-foreign-threat-ebola <p>Young children sit on the laps of medical staff, watching intently as a briefing describes the dangers of Ebola. Foreigners and citizens arriving at the capital’s airport are held in quarantine for weeks. Tourists are banned outright.</p> <p>The world’s most draconian measures against the disease have been imposed not in the worst-affected west African countries, nor their neighbours, but in North Korea, thousands of miles from the outbreak.</p> <p>They are increasing the isolation of a country already known for its tight controls on contact with outsiders, and risk damaging its fragile economy.</p> <p>The Guardian was among the small number of foreigners allowed to fly in after the ban on tour groups but before the imposition of quarantine on all those entering from abroad. The fear is tangible; a factory and a research centre which journalists were due to visit cancelled the invitations, citing Ebola concerns.</p> <p>“It’s Ebola hysteria,” said one foreigner in the country. “People are really scared.”</p> <p>Each night, the country’s television news broadcasts a lengthy section on the disease, filling the screen with images of grieving families, ailing patients and medical workers in protective gear – as well as some coverage of its own measures, including footage of the session at the children’s hospital.</p> <p>On Friday the state news agency KCNA announced in a one-sentence news report: “A brisk hygienic information service goes on in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to prevent the outbreak of Ebola.”</p> <p>But the news bulletins appear to have alarmed rather than reassured many North Koreans.</p> <p>“People are asking foreigners for information; they don’t understand Ebola and don’t really know what it is,” said a westerner in the capital.</p> <p>At Pyongyang’s airport, groups of uniformed soldiers toiled at “Korea speed” – a zealous pace – to complete the gleaming new building that will soon replace the small, dingy terminal. It is evidence of the country’s recent push to attract more international visitors, like the kitschily accomplished aquatic performances at the capital’s dolphinarium, and the sizeable Mirim Riding Club, where tourists can trot around a sawdust-strewn arena with a trainer for $40 (£25). Both are lauded as projects for the people, but promoted to foreigners.</p> <p>Those plans to expand tourism – earning precious foreign currency – are now on hold indefinitely. The Yanggakdo Hotel, one of the few hotels in Pyongyang where foreigners may stay, was largely deserted, though some Chinese business travellers and a handful of westerners remained. Chinese croupiers in its casino said they had seen few guests.</p> <p>Some believe the stringent Ebola measures reflect the state’s enduring suspicion towards the outside world, even as it tries to benefit from contact. Others think the real causes are more prosaic, citing the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/23/north-korean-health-system-crumbling-sanctions" title="">poor state of the country’s health system</a> and the adoption of similar measures when the respiratory disease Sars hit the region in 2003.</p> <p>“I understand the logic of what they are doing, even if it seems extreme. They don’t think they can control any outbreaks of anything like that and with Sars and avian flu they developed what for them are now standard operating procedures,” said Hazel Smith, an expert on North Korea at the University of Central Lancashire.</p> <p>“If there was someone with Ebola coming in, it wouldn’t be easy to avoid contagion: they have problems with electricity, running water and disinfectants.</p> <p>“Sars was close and they were one of the few countries in east Asia that avoided it. They think this approach has proved successful in the past; the question of whether [Ebola] is relevant to them is another matter.”</p> <p>She noted that there had been intense debates in other countries over what precautions were appropriate. Australia and Canada have introduced visa bans on people from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the countries worst affected by Ebola. Other countries have introduced screening for travellers arriving from those places. But none has taken measures even approaching those in North Korea.</p> <p>The country announced it was banning all tour groups on 23 October. It also began refusing entry to citizens of countries that had had Ebola cases: a Beijing-based Spanish cameraman was told he could not make a scheduled trip.</p> <p>Two individuals from African countries – both far from the outbreak zone – were ordered into quarantine after arrival in Pyongyang, though one has since been allowed to leave.</p> <p>An unknown number of North Korean citizens who have returned from abroad have also been quarantined, although it is not clear if the measure applies to all countries or specific ones. North Korea has diplomatic ties with Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Kim Yong Nam, the head of the country’s parliament, has been touring Africa, visiting Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Ethiopia with other senior officials including the minister of public health.</p> <p>On Thursday the country tightened measures further, announcing that all foreigners entering the country would have to undergo a three-week quarantine period.</p> <p>Foreign visitors who entered in the days before the quarantine announcement were told that daily temperature checks were compulsory.</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01500&amp;num=12486" title="">DailyNK website</a>, which relies on sources inside the country, has also reported internal travel restrictions preventing many North Koreans from visiting the capital and requiring others to obtain a health certificate before making the journey.</p> <p>“It’s very much a trade-dependent economy, and especially trade with China now is absolutely crucial for the daily life of citizens at every level of society,” warned Andray Abrahamian, executive director of Choson Exchange, a non-profit organisation helping North Koreans to help develop their understanding of business and economics. “To have that cut off for even a few weeks would be debilitating.”</p> <p>However, he added that exemptions were likely almost immediately, especially for Chinese citizens with multiple entry visas. “The people who do have contacts with Chinese businesspeople can get the message flowing upwards that this is seriously damaging to the economy.”</p> <p>Smith said: “North Korea is completely different from 10 years ago. There are powerful push factors that will ensure important economic exchanges will continue. The last thing they want is to stop major commercial interchange. All the elite have big commercial interests.”</p> <p>When it came to smaller-scale trade, officials no longer had full enforcement capacity in Chinese border areas, she added: “There will be bribes and people slipping backhanders to get people in.”</p> <p>Associated Press said on Friday that Chinese businesspeople on the border had said they were unaffected and China’s state news agency, Xinhua, reported that no Chinese nationals had been quarantined.</p> <p>Already, officials have said that diplomats and the staff of international organisations – who have to make regular trips to Beijing for cash and other supplies because of sanctions – can serve their quarantine at home rather than at designated quarantine hotels. That is a relaxation of the Sars rules.</p> <p>Those in the tourism industry say thousands of westerners and perhaps a few hundred thousand Chinese visit North Korea each year, as well as many Malaysians and Singaporeans. Summer is the peak time for visitors, but several upcoming tours have been hit.</p> <p>“The best guess anyone has is that this will last for the rest of this year – and after that we will see,” said Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, which has already cancelled one trip.</p> <p>“If Ebola subsides, they can open up the country and say, ‘We got it right’,” said Gareth Johnson, managing director of the firm Young Pioneers, which had several tours booked this winter. “The problem is that if it gets any worse, or there’s an Ebola case in China, they will feel they cannot open up again.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/02/will-no-one-help-liberias-ebola-orphan-children <p>In their single-room house, in a Monrovia back street, 16-year-old Promise Cooper and her three younger sisters slept beside their father’s corpse for three days. After hearing rumours about her sick father, neighbours had turned away Promise’s pleas for help lest she pass Ebola on to them. Eventually, health officials removed the body, along with the Coopers’ belongings, including their bedding and clothing, and then disinfected the house with chlorine spray. The Cooper girls were left with just the clothes they were wearing and one cup of rice a generous neighbour had nervously prodded towards their door with a stick.</p> <p>Promise’s story is far from unique – hundreds of stories like this have been created each month in Monrovia since May. And, with certainty, there will be thousands more before Ebola is done.</p> <p>You would have thought that international donors, those who care for people most in need, would have long since mobilised for such children. They haven’t. There is not one major charity doing any work on a large scale for Ebola orphans in Monrovia. I know this because I spent all last week not just in the poorest slums where Ebola is spreading but also traipsing around all the big charities’ Monrovia offices, trying to figure out who, if anyone, was doing anything for orphans.</p> <p>Where is the urgency? While children such as Promise and her sisters languish, a group of charities in Monrovia known as “the Psychosocial Cluster” devoted, alongside the ministry of health, a whole day last week to deciding what questions should appear on an “orphans and vulnerable child assessment form”.</p> <p>Some of the solutions they are developing are also worrying. They look smart on paper but seem divorced from the realities of the limited capacity on the ground and, in particular, the sheer scale of the orphan crisis. For instance, there is a focus on “interim care centres” for orphans. While there are hundreds of orphans there are only two such centres. And neither is more than half full because there is nobody in the “Ebola response system” to identify orphaned and vulnerable children, nobody to provide any guidance or support,and definitely nobody to show them the way to the centres. Moreover, traumatised children do not want to be in a centre, they want to be at home.</p> <p>Equally worrying was an announcement at the “Psychosocial Cluster” meeting that the official number of orphans in Greater Monrovia sits at 157. The records alone of the charity I work for document almost 500 Ebola orphans. And we’re certain that there are many more still.</p> <p>Promise and her sisters, thankfully, are among those 500 children now being cared for. They have fresh bedding, a bag of rice, clothes and comfort. But this is just the first step . An adult care-giver and some form of sustainable livelihood support will be needed soon.</p> <p>I have travelled to West Africa on countless occasions. I have not cried before. Last week, I cried every day. There is unimaginable sadness and suffering here. Fighting Ebola is one thing but the human consequence of Ebola is its own horrific tragedy. Addressing this – not just containing Ebola – is how we show we care about West Africans. Far too little, too feebly, is being done. This must change – urgently.</p> <p><em>Chloe Brett is Liberia Programme director of </em><a href="www.street-child.co.uk" title=""><em>Street Child</em></a></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/02/ebola-sierra-leone-bottom-world-health-index-western-aid <p>The importance of western aid in helping to build effective health systems in the developing world has been highlighted by a respected international thinktank finding that Sierra Leone, an early source of the Ebola outbreak, was the country least likely to be able to deal with the virus.</p> <p>The west African state has been ranked bottom of a health index compiled by the Legatum Institute, to be published on Monday, examining the governance of public health in 142 countries along with indices such as infant mortality, life expectancy and healthcare spending.</p> <p>There are 0.4 hospital beds per 1,000 people in Sierra Leone and health spending is $205 per person, according to the research. It has the second highest rate of tuberculosis in the world (674 per 100,000 people), and the highest incidence of infant mortality at 117.4 per 1,000 live births. The Legatum Institute says that, as a result, the country was “singularly ill equipped to deal with a problem like Ebola”.</p> <p>James Barty, senior adviser to the Legatum Institute, said: “The Ebola outbreak has shocked the world in how it has continued to spread and the number of lives it is now taking. The warning signs were there, though. Low levels of healthcare spending and weak governance structures in many African countries have been the norm for a considerable length of time. The good news is that the index suggests the west’s health systems, including the UK, are set up to be able to cope with the virus, should it arrive from Africa. In stark contrast to those African countries hit by the outbreak, the west does have the resources and health governance to be able to put into place measures to deal with Ebola.</p> <p>“The west must continue to help countries like Sierra Leone to prevent a future outbreak from happening.”</p> <p>The new report follows the finding by the Commons international development select committee last month that budgeted spending for Sierra Leone by the department for international relations has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/ebola-conference-london-hammond-sierra-leone" title="">been cut for this year</a>. The MPs reported that Britain’s reduced funding could have helped compromise Sierra Leone’s health systems, which have disintegrated in the face of the epidemic, exacting a heavy death toll on health workers as well as patients.</p> <p>Britain’s budget for Sierra Leone and Liberia decreased for 2014-2015 by £14.5m (18.6%) compared with 2013-14.</p> <p>According to the Legatum Institute, the highest-ranked countries on the health index are the US, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Japan and Norway. The UK is ranked 19th in the world for health, behind major European countries including the Netherlands (6th), Germany (7th) and France (9th), but ahead of Spain (22nd) and Italy (24th).</p> <p>Both the UK and the US have 2.9 hospital beds per 1,000 people. The US spends almost three times as much on health, but it is largely funded through private contributions. Health spending per year is $8,895 per person in the US compared with $3,495 per person in the UK, the report finds.</p> <p>The Legatum Institute’s global index, which also ranks countries in terms of wealth and wellbeing, further paints an alarming picture of other countries in west Africa, whose populations run the risk of contagion.</p> <p>Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Mali are similarly ill-equipped for an outbreak. Nigeria is ranked 132nd on the health sub-index, Ivory Coast is ranked 128th and Mali is ranked 123rd. Guinea and Liberia, the other two countries most affected by the outbreak of Ebola, are also near the bottom (134th and 129th respectively).</p>

In stark contrast to those African countries hit by the outbreak, the west does have the resources and health governance to be able to put into place measures to deal with Ebola.</p> <p>“The west must continue to help countries like Sierra Leone to prevent a future outbreak from happening.”</p> <p>The new report follows the finding by the Commons international development select committee last month that budgeted spending for Sierra Leone by the department for international relations has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/ebola-conference-london-hammond-sierra-leone" title="">been cut for this year</a>.</p> <p>The MPs reported that Britain’s reduced funding could have helped compromise Sierra Leone’s health systems, which have disintegrated in the face of the epidemic, exacting a heavy death toll on health workers as well as patients.</p> <p>Britain’s budget for Sierra Leone and Liberia decreased for 2014-2015 by £14.5m (18.6%) compared with 2013-14.</p> <p>According to the Legatum Institute, the highest-ranked countries on the health index are the US, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Japan and Norway. The UK is ranked 19th in the world for health, behind major European countries including the Netherlands (6th), Germany (7th) and France (9th), but ahead of Spain (22nd) and Italy (24th).</p> <p>Both the UK and the US have 2.9 hospital beds per 1,000 people. The US spends almost three times as much on health, but it is largely funded through private contributions. Health spending per year is $8,895 per person in the US compared with $3,495 per person in the UK, the report finds. The Legatum Institute’s global index, which also ranks countries in terms of wealth and wellbeing, further paints an alarming picture of other countries in west Africa, whose populations run the risk of contagion.</p> <p>Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Mali are similarly ill-equipped for an outbreak. Nigeria is ranked 132nd on the health sub-index, Ivory Coast is ranked 128th and Mali 123rd. Guinea and Liberia, the other two countries most affected by the outbreak of Ebola, are also near the bottom (134th and 129th respectively).</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/01/ebola-kaci-hickox-good-science-must-prevail <p>Kaci Hickox embodies all the American values conservatives say they admire. She’s tough – you don’t volunteer to leave New England to stem the spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone unless you have courage. She’s a rugged individualist, filled with the pioneering spirit, who makes her own way, without waiting for the say-so of “big government”. No tax-dollar funded politician or bureaucrat is going to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/white-house-kaci-hickox-nurse-ebola-quarantine" title="">lock her up in the land of the free</a>.</p> <p>She knows, as every doctor knows, that Ebola is only transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of a “symptomatic” person – that is a carrier who has developed or gone beyond the early symptoms of <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/" title="">fevers and fatigue</a>. Hickox has no symptoms and sees no reason to undergo house arrest to please an over-mighty state.</p> <p>You’d have thought that American Republicans would applaud her. Instead, they want “big government” to bring her into line. The right-wing media negates their own selfish philosophy and <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/391415/kaci-hickox-selfish-hero-ian-tuttle" title="">condemn her</a> as “self-centred, self-entitled”. Paul LePage, Maine’s loud-mouthed, know-nothing blubberball of a governor, threatens to place her under effective house arrest.</p> <p>There’s an election on, as you may have guessed. About <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/10/31/kaci-hickox-political-bogeyman/" title="">80% of Americans </a> believe, on the basis of no evidence whatsoever, that US citizens returning from West Africa should be quarantined. Paranoia is running riot. Parents in Oklahoma demanded that the authorities quarantine a teacher who went to Rwanda, which is nowhere near West Africa. A Connecticut school banned a child because she went to Nigeria, which has been declared free of the virus.</p> <p>Most seriously, Louisiana politicians have wrecked a conference on tropical diseases due to begin today in New Orleans. Its embarrassed organisers told those doctors who have been to West Africa within the past 21 days – that is, those doctors who are most likely to know what should be done – to stay away or be quarantined. “We see no utility in you travelling to New Orleans to simply be confined to your room,” their sheepish email read.</p> <p>Assorted wackos from religious apologists to postmodern relativists rage against the oppressive ideology of “scientism”. They say its arrogant disciples insist that only truths that stand the test of the scientific method can be believed. They force their doctrines, which cranks always insist are no more “true” than the doctrines of alternative health/religion/intelligent design/Holocaust denial (delete where applicable) on the rest of society, allowing no dissent. One only has to look at the Ebola panic to see the falsity of the myth of the imperial scientist. It cannot restrain a hysterical public and the seedy politicians who egg them on. Neither cares that if Ebola is to be stopped thousands more men and women with the courage of Hickox must go to West Africa, and they may well be deterred if puffed-up demagogues boom they are selfish rather than selfless and try to lock them up to placate popular prejudice.</p> <p>Ah, I hear you say, the hysterics in question are American hysterics, from a land famed for its stupidity. The patriot in me would like to believe the British will behave better after our first Ebola death. But, let’s face it, many among us will not. Ukip knows as well as the Tea Party the electoral advantages of noisily proclaimed ignorance. I do not expect it to welcome home men and women who have been trying to save the lives of black Africans, nor after his pathetic capitulation to the far right do I expect David Cameron to make a stand.</p> <p>Perhaps he will prove me wrong, but as of last week we have a debased prime minister who would rather leave refugees to drown in the Mediterranean than challenge extremists. His record on fighting irrational prejudice is just as dismal as his record on immigration. Older readers will remember that Cameron once presented himself as a moderate, modern conservative. When he fought for the leadership, he <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100137480/david-cameron-knows-the-drug-laws-arent-working-his-failure-to-change-them-is-simple-cowardice/" title="">called for</a> “alternative ways, including the possibility of legalisation and regulation, to tackle the global drugs dilemma”. A decade on, he still knows the alternatives work. He still knows prohibition feeds organised crime. Someone must have told him that Portugal saw a 50% drop in drug addiction after it decriminalised drug use. And his own Home Office certainly told him that harsh punishments have <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11197009/Official-report-triggers-Home-Office-row-over-decriminalisation-of-drugs.html." title="">no effect </a></p> <p>But the British prime minister is such a fool that he ignores evidence that inconveniences him and such a coward he condemns liberals for advocating the policies he once advocated in the vain hope of placating a right that will always hate him. We should show a little humility before we allow ourselves to feel superior to “stupid” America.</p> <p>Amid all the bombast of last week, the scientific journal <em>Nature </em>and the campaign group <a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/maddox-prize-2014.html#sthash.j6z2dcWx.dpuf" title="">Sense About Science</a> awarded the annual John Maddox prize to writers who challenge superstition. The joint winners confronted beliefs that are as prevalent in Britain as America: that vaccination causes autism, that homeopathic medicines work, that manmade climate change does not exist and that adding fluoride to the water supply is a threat to health. (I didn’t know it until the prize jury told me but Sinn Féin is leading a vigorous anti-fluoride campaign in Dublin – well, I suppose it’s progress for the IRA to go from blowing off peoples’ heads to merely rotting their teeth.)</p> <p>David Robert Grimes, one of the winners, said that, contrary to the myth of the scientific bully, most of his colleagues wanted to keep out of public debate, presumably because they did not wish to receive the threats of violence fanatics and quacks have directed at him. If we are to improve public policy in areas as diverse as the fight against Ebola to the treatment of drug addicts, they need to be a braver, and more willing to tell the public, which so often funds their research, what they have learned.</p> <p>Grimes makes a useful distinction. Most people just want more information and scientists should be prepared to make their case clearly and concisely. Then there are the rest – Ukip, the Tea Party, governors of Maine, Sinn Féin, David Cameron, climate change deniers – who will block out any evidence that contradicts their beliefs. They confirm the truth of Paul Simon’s line: “All lies and jest, still the man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.”</p> <p>They can’t be convinced. They just have to be fought.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/31/maine-nurse-ebola-guidelines-judge-lifts-order <p>Maine suffered defeat in its attempts to restrict the movements of a nurse who returned to the state after working with Ebola patients in west Africa, when a judge reversed an earlier ruling.</p> <p>A Maine judge on Friday ruled that Kaci Hickox must comply with monitoring for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola">Ebola symptoms</a>, but lifted an order that she stay away from public gatherings and maintain a 3ft distance from others, though those requirements had complied with current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for people in a situation like hers.</p> <p>“[Maine] has not met its burden at this time to prove by clear and convincing evidence that limiting [Hickox’s] movements to the degree requested is ‘necessary to protect other individuals from the dangers of infection’,” chief district court judge Charles C LaVerdiere wrote in an order posted on Friday afternoon. “[Hickox] currently does not show any symptoms of Ebola and is therefore not infectious.”</p> <p>LaVerdiere had previously issued a temporary order restricting Hickox’s movements. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/maine">Maine</a> officials initially attempted to quarantine Hickox in her home until 10 November, despite the fact that she has shown no symptoms of Ebola and has twice tested negative for the disease, but they backed down after Hickox threatened legal action and hired two civil rights attorneys.</p> <p>“I am very satisfied with the decision,” Hickox said at a press conference after LaVerdiere’s ruling. “The three points he is recommending I abide by are three points I still believe are part of this good compromise I believe we can make.”</p> <p>A full hearing of Hickox’s case is scheduled for 4 and 5 November.</p> <p>Hickox was stopped at Newark Liberty airport a week ago after she arrived from Sierra Leone, where she had been working for Doctors Without Borders caring for Ebola patients. Sierra Leone is one of the three west African countries hit hardest by the disease.</p> <p>The temporary order had required Hickox to abide by guidelines laid down by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But the judge’s Friday ruling rolled back several of those requirements.</p> <p>Though Hickox still must comply with health department monitoring, taking her temperature twice a day and reporting any symptoms, but she doesn’t have to avoid public places. She still must coordinate travel with health officials so her monitoring isn’t interrupted.</p> <p>“The court is fully aware of the misconceptions, misinformation, bad science and bad information being spread from shore to shore in our country with respect to Ebola,” LaVerdiere wrote. “However, whether that fear is rational or not, it is present and it is real. [Hickox’s] actions at this point, as a healthcare professional, need to demonstrate her full understanding of human nature and the real fear that exists.”</p> <p>Maine officials wanted to restrict Hickox’s movements to the town of Fort Kent where she lives, bar her from public gatherings and force her to stay 3ft away from others. Governor Paul LePage, who is currently in a tight election race for his job, had also called Thursday for her to be subject to another blood test. Hickox didn’t say whether she would go into town, but said she is “taking things minute by minute,” and that she didn’t “want to make anyone uncomfortable.” </p> <p>Hickox became the center of a debate on how to treat healthcare workers returning from Ebola-ravaged west African countries after she was detained in Newark, New Jersey. There, she was questioned for hours, and eventually quarantined in a tent outside a hospital with a portable toilet and no shower. </p> <p>New Jersey governor Chris Christie backed down on his pledge to keep healthcare workers, and Hickox in particular, in a 21-day quarantine, after she threatened legal action. New Jersey released Hickox on Monday and she was transported via private car more than 600 miles to Maine. </p> <p>Once Hickox was in Fort Kent, a town of about 4,100 people near the Canadian border, Maine officials attempted to place her under similar 21-day quarantine measures. The nurse <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/maine-nurse-defies-ebola-quarantine-bike-ride">publicly criticized authorities’ efforts</a>, arguing the measures infringed on her civil liberties and that such measures weren’t grounded in good science. People infected with the Ebola virus are only contagious when they are symptomatic. </p> <p>“We have been in negotiations all day with the state of Maine, and [have] tried to resolve this amicably, but they will not allow me to leave my house and have any interaction with the public, even though I am completely healthy and symptom-free,” said Hickox from her front porch in Fort Kent, at a press conference on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Through the week, Hickox told authorities she would leave her home if she couldn’t reach an agreement with the state, and on Thursday she went for a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/maine-nurse-defies-ebola-quarantine-bike-ride">one-mile bike ride with her boyfriend</a>. </p> <p>Hickox was the first healthcare worker who states attempted to subject to movement restrictions. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/white-house-kaci-hickox-nurse-ebola-quarantine">The measures have been criticized by medical professionals and aid organizations</a>. </p> <p>States announced heightened restrictions after a New York City doctor was diagnosed with Ebola following his work with patients in west Africa, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/index.html">where the disease has killed nearly 5,000 people</a>. Health officials disclosed after New York City doctor Craig Spencer’s diagnosis that he’d traveled around the city of 8.4 million people, going on a three-mile jog, bowling, and taking the subway. Spencer is being treated at Bellevue hospital in New York.</p> <p>For now, Hickox will remain in Fort Kent, where local residents and officials have had mixed reactions. The police department has fielded almost 40 calls per day about her, about half of which are from concerned citizens, some from out of state. Other locals have supported Hickox, <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2014/10/30/news/aroostook/nurse-leaves-home-for-bike-ride-thursday-morning/">even delivering her a pizza</a>. </p> <p>For now, Hickox says she just wants to relax with her boyfriend. “Tonight, I am going to try to convince Ted to make my favorite Japanese meal, and I think we’re going to watch a scary movie.”<br /></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-ebola-crisis-briefing <h2>What’s the story?</h2> <p>West Africa is experiencing <strong>the biggest outbreak of the Ebola virus ever known</strong>, causing thousands of deaths, devastating fragile healthcare systems and damaging the economies of countries, some of which are still recovering from civil war. Infections are thought to be doubling every few weeks. The WHO says there were <strong>13,700 officially registered cases</strong> by the end of October, almost all in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, with about <strong>5,000 deaths</strong>, but many go unrecorded and the true figure is thought to be two to three times higher. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6303a1.htm">The US Centres for Disease Control (CDC)</a> says that if nothing changes there could be 1.4 million cases by late January. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/29/ebola-epidemic-turning-point-wellcome-trust">Liberia has shown a slight drop in the numbers</a>, but the WHO has warned this could be temporary. Concerns for countries bordering the epidemic region intensified <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/28/mali-rushes-contain-ebola-first-case">when a child died of Ebola in Mali</a>, having travelled while sick for hundreds of miles by bus.

There have also been cases in Nigeria and Senegal. As of 29 October, the WHO put the number of cases as 13,703 and deaths at 4,920 but the figures are uncertain and the true fatality rate is 70%.</p> <p>Ebola outbreaks in the past have generally been in remote rural areas with swift action to isolate the victims able to contain them. <strong>The WHO has been criticised for not reacting fast enough</strong> to the outbreak: it took three months to diagnose the first cases, and five months more before a public health emergency was declared. <br /></p>  <figure class="element element-image element--supporting" data-media-id="gu-fc-7b720202-33be-40d5-b737-9a1d93adda69"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/25/1411651522090/c90afe25-d712-4f7f-b26f-ec20cb370419-460x276.jpeg" alt="Liberian nurses escort a suspected Ebola patient into a treatment center in Monrovia" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Liberian nurses escort a suspected Ebola patient into a treatment centre in Monrovia.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Ahmed Jallanzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An editorial for the <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1411471">New England Journal of Medicine</a> by Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, and Peter Piot, the head of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the exceptional spread of the disease was probably down to a number of factors including <strong>dysfunctional health systems</strong>, <strong>high population mobility</strong> across state borders, <strong>densely populated capitals</strong> and <strong>lack of trust in authorities</strong> after years of armed conflict meaning health advice is not heeded. Fear is also a factor. People are afraid to go to hospital because they think it may be the source of infection.<br /></p> <h2>The issues</h2> <p><strong>How the disease spreads</strong></p> <p>Ebola is not an air-borne disease and can only be spread from human to human through close contact with the bodily fluids of someone who has the disease – in <strong>blood, vomit, semen, urine, tears or saliva</strong>. The incubation period – the gap between an individual being infected and showing symptoms – is up to 21 days, meaning it is possible for an infected person to travel widely before they know they have the disease. <strong>Humans are not infectious until they develop symptoms</strong>, which at first are fever, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. These are followed by <strong>vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function</strong> and in some cases internal and external bleeding.</p> <p><strong>Death of health workers</strong></p> <p>The spread of Ebola through bodily fluids puts health workers dealing with such symptoms as vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding at a high risk. By 27 October, 521 health workers had developed the disease across Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, with 272 dead. While pictures of doctors in full body suits and visors treating Ebola patients have been published all over the world, <strong>there is in reality not enough protective clothing</strong>. The suits are also uncomfortable to wear in hot climates and risk contamination when they are taken off. Most health workers are infected in clinics treating patients they do not know or suspect have Ebola. <strong>The first symptoms can resemble malaria</strong>, which is common. Some healthcare workers have been staying away from work for fear of the disease, and in Liberia there have been strikes over pay and conditions.</p> <p><strong>No drugs or vaccine</strong></p> <p>Until now, pharmaceutical firms have given Ebola very low priority. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/26/ebola-vaccine-race-is-on">Potential drugs and vaccines under development are now being sped into trials</a>. Healthy volunteers in Europe, the US and unaffected African countries have been injected with candidate vaccines to test safety. <strong>Three vaccines are expected to be tested in health workers and burial teams at high risk in west Africa in December</strong>. Drug trials will soon also be set up there, although there is no certainty that they will work. Stocks of ZMapp, the experimental drug used to treat several international aid workers and medical staff, have run out. That and other drugs are now bring rushed into production, ahead of efficacy data.</p> <p><strong>Healthcare system collapse</strong></p> <p>Healthcare in the region was fragile at best before Ebola. Now there is disintegration as staff become ill or stay away for fear of the disease. <strong>Infection control and hygiene are major issues</strong>. Soap and water are unavailable in some areas. Alcohol hand rubs are needed on a large scale. Isolation facilities are vital to contain Ebola, as are labs for testing because rapid diagnosis is very important. Both are in very short supply. In some places, isolation is nothing more than an area behind a curtain. People with other diseases and women in childbirth are at risk because hospitals are no longer functioning properly.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Healthcare spending per capita in west Africa">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/23/1411485332853/HealthcarespendpercapitaCur.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><br /></h2> <p><strong><strong>Cultural issues</strong></strong><br />Levels of virus in infected people are highest in the late stage of disease and in dead bodies. The disease has often spread during traditional funeral practices that involve close contact with the corpse. Burial teams in protective clothing are being dispatched to homes to collect and safely dispose of bodies. Another route of transmission has been <strong>traditional healing practices</strong>, which involve touching. Families are at high risk when they nurse their sick at home, as is traditionally the norm.<br /></p> <p>Persuading people to change their cultural practices has been hard. There is little respect for government authority in a region still emerging from civil war and where corruption is rife. Advice that runs counter to cultural practices is resented and in the absence of authority, myth and superstition take over.</p> <h2>How can I find out more?</h2> <p>The <strong><strong>New England Journal of Medicine</strong></strong> published a <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411100">detailed report written by the WHO’s Ebola team</a> to mark nine months since the start of the outbreak. The <strong><strong>WHO</strong></strong> itself also produced <a href="http://who.int/csr/disease/ebola/ebola-6-months/en/">a compilation of articles in August to mark six months since the first case was formally identified</a>. They examine Ebola’s impact on west Africa and warn that without measures to control it, the number of cases will rise fast. <strong><strong>Médecins sans Frontières</strong></strong> provides <a href="http://www.msf.org.uk/ebola?gclid=CNfZ3uON-sACFUrpwgodyAsARQ">information on its treatment centres and regular reports from the frontline</a>.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/31/maine-nurse-kaci-hickox-cdc-ebola <p>The state of Maine released a temporary court order on Friday that places restrictions on the movements of a nurse who worked with Ebola patients in west Africa, but who has not shown any symptoms of the disease.</p> <p>The court order allows Kaci Hickox to leave her home, but she may not go to public gatherings and must maintain a 3ft distance from other people.</p> <p>In a decision issued on Friday morning, chief district court judge Charles C LaVerdiere wrote that the case had “critical implications for [Hickox’s] freedom”, and “the public’s right to be protected from the potential severe harm posed by transmission of a devastating disease”.</p> <p>A further hearing will be held to determined the legality of the measures.</p> <p>Maine officials had wanted to quarantine Hickox in her home until 10 November. Officials backed down after Hickox threatened legal action and hired two civil rights attorneys.</p> <p>Hickox was stopped at Newark Liberty airport a week ago after she arrived from Sierra Leone, where she had been working for Doctors Without Borders caring for Ebola patients. Sierra Leone is one of the three west African countries worst affected by the disease.</p> <p>The temporary order requires Hickox to abide by a set of restrictions that largely mirror guidelines laid down by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). She must stay in Fort Kent, and if she does travel, coordinate with health officials. She will be allowed to go outside, as she did during <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/maine-nurse-defies-ebola-quarantine-bike-ride">a bike ride on an isolated road on Thursday</a>, but she must maintain a 3ft distance from others.

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/31/ebola-outbreak-what-can-we-learn <p>The struggle to contain the Ebola outbreak has pushed global health into the spotlight. While much has been said about the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/world-health-organisation-botched-ebola-outbreak" title="">world’s slow response to the crisis</a>, focus has also shifted to the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/aug/13/ebola-epidemic-poor-facilities-distrust-healthcare" title="">broken health systems</a> that contributed to the epidemic.</p> <p>Our <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/audio/2014/oct/31/ebola-crisis-global-health-podcast" title="">latest Global development podcast</a> explores the lessons the Ebola outbreak can teach us about global health inequality, looking at the weaknesses in the current response, the shortfall in global health spending, and the actions required to prevent further outbreaks. The Guardian’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, spoke to <a href="http://www.who.int/dg/adg/kieny/en/" title="">Dr Marie-Paule Kieny</a> of the World Health Organisation, along with <a href="http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/alumni/survey/professor_david_heymann.html" title="">Professor David Heymann</a> from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Oxfam’s <a href="http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/our-people/advocacy/mohga-kamal-yanni" title="">Mohga Kamal-Yanni</a>.</p> <p>Kieny said it was not enough simply to rebuild the health systems weakened by Ebola; leaders should instead rethink how health sectors operate in developing countries, she argued. “It does definitely need a new way of thinking, not just at a national level but at a global level,” said Kieny. “The worry is that once Ebola goes from the headlines, then we’re back to square one until we have the next outbreak.”</p> <p>We want to know what you think.

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/31/ebola-nigeria-state-public-sector-calestous-juma <p>In a moment of welcome relief about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/20-october-2014/en/">declared Nigeria free</a> of the virus. This news comes at a time of competing pledges from the international community to fight the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/08/africa-ebola-outbreak-how-do-pre-20148138355590807.html">outbreak</a>.</p> <p>A brief look at the news suggests African countries aren’t stepping up their support to the affected countries. This view, however, ignores three important lessons from Africa’s response to the outbreak.</p> <p>The first is the capacity of the state to act in a timely and aggressive manner. Recently, WHO Nigerian representative <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/nigeria-declared-ebola-free-must-remain-vigilant">Rui Gama Vaz said</a>: “The virus is gone for now. The outbreak in Nigeria has been defeated.</p> <p>“This is a spectacular success story that shows to the world Ebola can be contained, but we must be clear that we have only won a battle. The war will only end when West Africa is declared free of Ebola.”</p> <p>Behind this success story lies competent public leaders and institutions that <a href="http://eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20920">pursued their mission with vigour</a>. After the diagnosis was made, Nigeria implemented a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/oct/07/nigeria-ebola-experience-teach-world">co-ordinated approach</a> that involved making 18,000 visits to about 898 people to check their temperatures. This was possible because Nigeria had the state capacity to undertake such a massive effort in a timely manner.</p> <p>The 898 people were linked to one initial infected patient. These included 351 primary and secondary contacts as well as 547 tertiary contacts. One nurse who had cared for the patient had traveled over 500km to Enugu where she potentially infected at least 21 people. </p> <p>This aggressive tracing, that included having access to phone records, was possible because Nigeria had the state capacity to undertake such a massive effort in a timely manner.</p> <p>One of the most <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/nigeria-ebola-crackdown-example-to-world">decisive aspects of the campaign</a> was the role of the Lagos state government under the competent leadership of Governor Babatunde Fashola. The state was able to draw relevant lessons from previous campaigns against polio. Equally important was the biomedical capacity in the teaching hospital of University of Lagos, which completed tests in 24 hours.</p> <p>First, a key lesson from Nigeria is the importance of the capacity of the state in protecting its citizens through a diversity of options. Those who believe the private sector can only function by shrinking the capacity of the public sector may be giving up their ability to protect citizens against public emergencies.</p> <p>The second lesson is the importance of human capacity. Pledging funds is only a small part of the solution. What is critical are medical boots on the ground. The most resounding rebuke of this old-school pledging competition came from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). In <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/10/msf-rejects-ebola-cash-asks-medics-201410210414437521.html">rejecting an offer of cash</a>, MSF said: “Even a dozen trained staff who could oversee local teams to manage an isolation centre, help case finding and outbreak control measures would save thousands of lives today.”</p> <p>Nigeria is <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/nigeria-send-600-volunteers-ebola-hit-countries-minister-174438597--business.html">sending trained healthcare workers</a> to affected countries, yet its efforts hardly receive attention in the international media. Uganda has sent doctors to the region, some of whom have perished in the fight. East Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are s<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/au-send-over-1-000-health-workers-ebola-171926176.html">ending 600 and 1,000 healthcare workers</a> to the affected countries respectively.</p> <p>The third lesson is reforming the governance system in light of lessons learned from the outbreak. Dr Stella Ameyo Adadevoh, who helped to stop the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2014/oct/20/dr-stella-ameyo-adadevoh-ebola-doctor-nigeria-hero">spread of Ebola in Nigeria and lost her life</a> in the process, symbolises Nigeria’s heroic battle. Her legacy now includes a decision by Governor Fashola to <a href="http://www.thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2014/10/19/fashola-appoints-chief-scientific-adviser-to-fight-ebola/?utm_content=buffer98bb0&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">appoint Dr Adekemi Oluwayemisi Sekoni</a> of Lagos University’s teaching hospital as chief scientific adviser (CSA). Her primary role will be to continue the fight against Ebola. </p> <p>By appointing a medical practitioner to serve as his CSA, governor Fashola has demonstrated the power of leading by learning.The recognition of the key role advisers play demonstrates how cities in Africa can leverage scientific and technical knowledge to inform their decision-making</p> <p>Ebola is rolling back years of economic effort in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. It is also exposing the <a href="http://www.africasacountry.com/there-is-no-ebola-here-what-liberia-teaches-us-about-the-failures-of-aid/">limitations of development models</a> that ignore the importance of building state capacity. A major lesson from the outbreak is that there is no substitute for effective public institutions in protecting the public interest.</p> <p><strong>Read more like this:</strong></p> <p>• <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/24/children-ebola-liberia-unicef-care-centres">Ebola’s children: after the trauma of loss, hope comes with a hug</a></p> <p>• <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/23/cuba-healthcare-lessons-ebola-sierra-leone-guinea-liberia">Cuba calling: what this small island can teach the world about disease control</a></p> <p>• <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/oct/20/ebola-volunteer-liberia-why-returned">Why I keep going back to West Africa to fight Ebola</a></p> <p><a href="https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/"><strong>Join our community</strong></a><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/31/ebola-opening-us-field-hospital-liberia-pressure-australia-respond <p>With a US-managed field hospital days away from opening in Liberia, pressure is mounting on the Australian government to send health staff to the region to tackle the Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 5,000 people.</p> <p>The 25-bed centre will treat international health workers who contract the virus and train them in how to manage it.</p> <p>So far the government has refused to provide funding to send health workers to the region, citing concerns about evacuating and treating them should they be infected.</p> <p>The shadow foreign affairs minister, Tanya Plibersek, who has been meeting officials in the US to discuss the global Ebola response, told the ABC on Friday morning the US field hospital would open within days and would provide treatment of a “first-world standard”.</p> <p>“It was made clear to me that the facility would be made available for health workers, not just Australian, but health workers of any nationality who are in west Africa fighting ebola,” Plibersek said.</p> <p>“Every meeting I’ve had here, whether it’s been with the World Bank, the United Nations, people within the White House or state department, it has been made clear to me that there is a strong view the the US, UK and to a degree, France, are bearing most of the responsibility for fighting this outbreak.</p> <p>“There is a disappointment that countries such as Australia are willing to sign up to UN resolutions calling for people to do more by sending equipment and resources and so on, but then not willing to follow through.”</p> <p>The president of the Australian Medical Association, Brian Owler, who has been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/17/7m-ebola-contribution-not-enough-australian-medical-association">urging the government</a> to escalate its response for weeks, told Guardian Australia on Friday the government now had no excuse not to send health workers to west Africa.</p> <p>“The excuse that we can’t adequately treat Australian workers doesn’t wash any more,” he said.</p> <p>“It’s actually better to treat someone in-country rather than transporting them 30 hours to get home, which is logistically difficult.</p> <p>“Now we know there are treatment centres being built we should send people because many health workers are ready and willing to go.”</p> <p>There were about 19 existing treatment centres, some of which remained unstaffed, he said.</p> <p>The government was shortsighted to focus its effort on preparing for an outbreak in the Asia Pacific region, Owler said.</p> <p>“At this stage, if there was a regional outbreak we’d be looking to countries like the US and a whole bunch of other countries to contribute to our response,” he said.</p> <p>“An outbreak in this region remains unlikely, but if it did occur, it would be good to have people on board who have received training and experience in west Africa.”</p> <p>A <a href="http://www.roymorgan.com/~/media/Files/Findings%20PDF/2014/October/5902-Australian-Response-To-Ebola-October-30-2014.pdf">Morgan Poll of more than 600 Australians has found</a> 70% were in favour of sending doctors and nurses to West Africa to fight the epidemic, while 23% were opposed to it. The rest were undecided.</p> <p>The Ebola outbreak is the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/index.html">largest in history</a>, having killed almost 5,000 people and infected almost 15,000.</p> <p>The World Bank has announced it <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/world-bank-invests-foreign-health-workers-ebola">will invest</a> more than $100m to support foreign health workers heading to the region.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/white-house-kaci-hickox-nurse-ebola-quarantine <p>The White House said on Thursday that it did not support the decision by a nurse in Maine to flout the voluntary quarantine imposed upon her by state authorities concerned about her exposure to Ebola.</p> <p>A spokesman for Barack Obama said that it was up to states to set their own public health rules, although he believed they should be guided by science.</p> <p>The standoff between state officials in Maine, and the nurse, Kaci Hickox, continued on Thursday when she defied a demand to stay at home and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/maine-nurse-defies-ebola-quarantine-bike-ride">went for a bike ride with her boyfriend</a>. But a threatened court order had not materalised by Thursday afternoon.</p> <p>Hickox has argued that forced 21-day isolation orders are medically unnecessary and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/26/ebola-christie-quarantine-west-africa-monitor-symptoms-airport">violate her civil rights</a>. She hired two New York City-based attorneys to fight Maine’s orders that she stay isolated indoors until 10 November. The governor of Maine, Paul LePage, said on Thursday he would back down, but only if Hickox agreed to take a blood test.</p> <p>“We have been in negotiations all day with the state of Maine, and tried to resolve this amicably but they will not allow me to leave my house and have any interaction with the public even though I am completely healthy and symptom-free,” said Hickox from her front porch in Fort Kent, at a press conference on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Maine state police followed Hickox on her bike ride with boyfriend Ted Wilbur to monitor her interaction with the public. Norman Siegel, one of<strong> </strong>Hickox<strong>’</strong>s attorneys, defended his client’s decision but noted that she avoided the centre of town so as not to “freak people out.” </p> <p>He added: “Since there’s no court order, she can be out in public. Even if people disagree with her position, I would hope they respect the fact that she’s taking into account the fear, which is based on misinformation about the way the disease is transmitted.” </p> <p>LePage, a Republican facing a close re-election battle, said negotiations between Hickox’s attorneys and the state failed, and he would continue to pursue legal action.</p> <p>In a statement, the governor said he would allow quarantined healthcare workers to “walking or jogging in a park,” but would not allow them to attend public gatherings, travel or come within three feet of others. The state is likely to seek confidentiality on any paperwork it files with local courts.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="6c409dcd7a0753805498b054a6dc4bfaf6540033"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/30/1414704133519/cc3427ee-8f37-4758-94d2-5c6313a6993c-460x276.jpeg" alt="Kaci Hickox" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Nurse Kaci Hickox on a bike ride with her boyfriend Ted Wilbur on Thursday.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Robert F Bukaty/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I was ready and willing – and remain ready and willing – to reasonably address the needs of healthcare workers meeting guidelines to assure the public health is protected,” he said.</p> <p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/ebola-nurse-kaci-hickox-swap-quarantine-blood-test/story?id=26569596&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=http://abcnews.go.com/&amp;utm_term=http://abcnews.go.com/&amp;utm_content=http://abcnews.go.com/">In an earlier interview with ABC News,</a> LePage said the issue could be resolved if Hickox took a blood test. “This could be resolved today. She has been exposed [to Ebola] and she’s not cooperative, so force her to take a test. It’s so simple.”</p> <p>Obama’s spokesman said that the president, who was coincidentally campaigning in Maine on Thursday, had no plans to visit Hickox and would remain some distance away in Portland.</p> <p>“The president believes the state can and should be responsible for the policy, they should be guided by the science but ultimately it is their decision,” spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters during a briefing on Air Force One.</p> <p>Asked whether that meant the administration believed Maine was not following the science, Earnest told the Guardian he was not in a position to judge.</p> <p>But he said officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had been in touch with the state to stress the importance of following scientific guidance when setting quarantine policy and “risk assessments should guide the degree to which the health of an individual” poses a risk.</p> <p>Armed state troopers have been posted outside Hickox’s house since Wednesday, standing outside with a huddle of reporters.</p> <p>Hickox hired attorneys after she was questioned and detained at Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey on her return from working with Ebola sufferers in Sierra Leone on Friday.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/maine-nurse-defies-ebola-quarantine-bike-ride <p>The fight between a Maine nurse under Ebola-quarantine orders and authorities intensified on Thursday, as the nurse defied state orders and went for a bike ride with her boyfriend.</p> <p>The nurse, Kaci Hickox, has argued that forced 21-day isolation orders are medically unnecessary and violate her civil rights. She has hired two New York City-based attorneys to fight <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/28/nurse-new-jersey-returns-home-ebola-quarantine">Maine’s orders that she stay isolated indoors</a> until 10 November. The governor of Maine said he would back down if she agreed to take a blood test, but the standoff continued on Thursday.</p> <p>“We have been in negotiations all day with the state of Maine, and tried to resolve this amicably but they will not allow me to leave my house and have any interaction with the public even though I am completely healthy and symptom-free,” said Hickox from her front porch in Fort Kent, at a press conference on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Armed state troopers have been guarding Hickox’s house since Wednesday, standing outside with a huddle of reporters. </p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/ABC/statuses/527819983120629760">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Ebola nurse Kaci Hickox defies quarantine and goes for a bike ride near her home in Maine <a href="http://t.co/btoLYeWDPh">http://t.co/btoLYeWDPh</a> <a href="http://t.co/sLvaenGOUF">pic.twitter.com/sLvaenGOUF</a></p>&mdash; ABC News (@ABC) <a href="https://twitter.com/ABC/status/527819983120629760">October 30, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Maine state police followed Hickox on her bike ride with boyfriend Ted Wilbur to monitor her interaction with the public.

She has been exposed [to Ebola] and she’s not cooperative, so force her to take a test. It’s so simple.”</p> <p>The governor later said negotiations between Hickox’s attorneys and the state failed, and he would continue to pursue legal action. In a statement, the governor said he would allow quarantined healthcare workers to “walking or jogging in a park,” but would not allow them to attend public gatherings, travel or come within three feet of others. The state is likely to seek confidentiality on any paperwork it files with local courts. </p> <p>The nurse hired attorneys after she was questioned and detained at Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey on Friday.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/homeopaths-offer-services-fight-ebola <p>Homeopaths have offered their services to prevent and treat Ebola in west Africa, claiming their “remedies” can work in serious epidemics of infectious disease.</p> <p>“Homeopaths worldwide have been mobilising their efforts toward gaining entrance in those countries affected,” the <a href="http://homeopathycenter.org/news/ebola-crisis-homeopathic-community" title="">National Center for Homeopathy</a> in the US said on its website. “The overriding goal is to investigate Ebola firsthand, and thereby determine which remedy or remedies are best for treating this disease.”</p> <p>The organisation claims that homeopathic remedies have been used successfully in other disease epidemics in the past, naming cholera, diphtheria and hepatitis among others.</p> <p>Scientists say there is no evidence that homeopathic remedies have any effect on the body, with the substances so heavily diluted that they are effectively water. But homeopathic clinics have been set up all over Africa, sometimes offering “cures” for such lethal diseases as Aids, tuberculosis and malaria.</p> <p>“There is not a jot of evidence that homeopathic treatments are effective for any infection such as Ebola,” said Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor at the University of Exeter. “To happily offer affected patients false hope is cruel; to pretend that homeopathy cures Ebola is irresponsible; to travel to West Africa on a ‘homeopathic mission’ is to disclose the insane delusions that affect many homeopaths.”</p> <p>In 2009, a group of young African and British doctors <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jun/01/world-health-organisation-homeopathy-hiv" title="">petitioned the World Health Organisation to speak out against homeopathy</a>, which they believed was endangering lives. Under the auspices of the Voice of Young Science, part of the London-based Sense About Science organisation, they asked WHO to condemn the promotion of homeopathy for treating TB, infant diarrhoea, influenza, malaria and HIV.</p> <p>“Homeopathy does not protect people from, or treat, these diseases,” they wrote. “Those of us working with the most rural and impoverished people of the world already struggle to deliver the medical help that is needed. When homeopathy stands in place of effective treatment, lives are lost.”</p> <p>In response, WHO experts, backed by the director general, stated that they did not recommend homeopathy for any of those conditions.</p> <p>There are currently no proven treatments for Ebola, which is killing 70% of those who are infected.</p> <p>“Medics working with the most rural and impoverished people of the world already struggle to deliver the medical help that is needed,” said Victoria Murphy, programme manager of Sense About Science. “The promotion of homeopathy as effective or cheaper makes this difficult task even harder. It puts lives at risk, undermines conventional medicine and spreads misinformation. When homeopathy stands in place of effective treatment, lives are lost.”</p> <p>One of the homeopathy clinics brought to the WHO’s attention in 2009 was the Amma Resonance Healing Foundation in Ethiopia, which offered homeopathy as “an ideal alternative and complement for the treatment of HIV/AIDS in developing countries”. The foundation, established in the Netherlands, is run by the British homeopath Peter Chappell. He and his colleague Harry van der Zee claim their<a href="http://www.arhf.nl/world-aids-day" title=""> homeopathic remedy can reverse Aids</a>.</p> <p>On their website, Van der Zee now urges supporters of homeopathy to sign the Change.org petition started in Australia, calling on WHO “to test and distribute homeopathy as quickly as possible to contain the outbreaks”.</p> <p>Among the signatories is Steffan Browning, a Green Party MP in New Zealand. He was publicly dismissed by the prime minister John Key as “barking mad”.</p> <p>“Let’s be honest, this is a serious global issue, and if he really thinks that’s the answer I’d love to see the medical research,” said Key.</p> <p>Browning admitted “it was probably a bit unwise” to sign the petition, which he also shared on his Facebook page encouraging other people to sign it. He said he had signed it “pretty late at night”, although he hoped WHO would keep an open mind on potential treatment options, since there was currently no cure.</p> <p>New Zealand’s health minister, Jonathan Coleman, however, said treating Ebola patients with homeopathic remedies was “a wacko idea”, adding: “I don’t know what he’s thinking, it’s very, very dangerous. I think he really needs to engage his brain, it’s a really and stupid dangerous idea.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/30/ebola-epidemic-guinea-wfp-uncharted-territory <p>The <a href="http://www.wfp.org/" title="">World Food Programme (WFP)</a> is facing an unprecedented challenge in Guinea as it struggles to halt the spread of the Ebola, feed more than 350,000 people and protect the progress made in tackling chronic child malnutrition over recent years, a senior official has warned.</p> <p>Elisabeth Faure, WFP’s Guinea director, said the scale of the epidemic was forcing the organisation to operate far beyond its core emergency mission of getting $25m (£15.5m) of food to at least 353,000 people.</p> <p>As well as distributing the food, she said, the programme was now being called on to help build Ebola treatment centres, move aid workers around the country and provide emergency communications.</p> <p>“We’re transporting medical equipment into remote areas, we’re helping with procuring personal protective equipment kits and gloves and we’re also moving humanitarian personnel with our humanitarian air service, which is a 19-seater aircraft,” she said.</p> <p>“It’s a very deep engagement that goes well beyond our mandate, frankly. This is a huge operation and what’s really different is building treatment centres. The WFP builds other things, like huge warehouses, and does road rehabilitation in order to get food from A to B … But the new thing is building treatment centres.”</p> <p>Faure said that WFP engineers, working with colleagues from the <a href="http://www.who.int/en/" title="">World Health Organisation</a> and blueprints from <a href="http://www.msf.org/" title="">Médecins Sans Frontières</a> were building four Ebola treatment centres, each with a 100-bed capacity.</p> <p>“It’s the scale of the logistics and emergency telecoms that is new,” she said. “This is quite unprecedented. It’s considered a level-three emergency by the organisation – which is the highest emergency – but in fact a lot of people are saying it is about a level-five: it’s much bigger than we’re used to.”</p> <p>The WFP, she added, urgently need more money to help it cope with the emergency: despite appealing for $120m for the regional food response, it has received only about $51m.</p> <p>The west African Ebola outbreak has so far claimed 4,922 lives, the vast majority in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Despite <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/29/ebola-epidemic-turning-point-wellcome-trust" title="">reports that the number of cases in Liberia has begun to fall</a>, Faure said things in Guinea were going in the opposite direction, with the “robust epidemic” showing no sign of subsiding.</p> <p>“We’ve seen several waves, with the number of cases increasing and then declining and increasing and declining again,” she said. “But we’re now in a kind of third peak – by far the highest peak – with the highest number of cases since the epidemic started in Guinea.”</p> <p>Faure said the wave pattern underlined the need to guard against complacency, adding that the disease was now starting to appear in previously unaffected areas of Guinea.</p> <p>Equally worrying, she said, was the effect it was having on people’s ability to feed their families.</p> <p>“The spread of Ebola has affected food trade and markets and also caused wages to go down in Guinea,” she said.</p> <p>A <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/16/ebola-text-messaging-combat-outbreak" title="">recent WFP survey carried out by text message</a> showed that people were beginning to eat less or reduce the number of meals they have each day to make their money go further.</p> <p>“That’s worrying, because we’re no longer in the lean season, where there are food shortages,” she said. “Guinea was a very food insecure country to begin with and, at this time of year, things should be beginning to improve.”</p> <p>The longer Ebola continued to spread in Guinea, said Faure, the greater the threat to existing programmes to fight the country’s levels of chronic child malnutrition, which stood at <a href="http://www.wfp.org/countries/guinea/overview" title="">40% in some areas even before the outbreak</a>.</p> <p>“Many of the health centres are closed and many of the health workers aren’t working any more, so all the programmes to treat malnutrition are likely to be affected,” she said. “That’s why we need to work not only on the emergency response, but also on the longer-term by restarting or expanding the nutrition programmes we have in the country. Otherwise, we’re going to see development basically being lost and all the progress that’s been made being reversed.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/30/immigration-cant-reveal-ebola-refugee-ban-advice-because-of-national-security <p>The government has refused an order by the Senate to reveal the reasons behind its ban on accepting refugees from Ebola-stricken Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, saying to disclose its advice would risk national security.</p> <p>On Monday the immigration minister, Scott Morrison, announced that Australia’s humanitarian visa program for refugees from Ebola-affected west African countries would be suspended – including processing applications – until further notice.</p> <p>Two days later the Senate ordered the government to table the advice it had relied on in making that decision, but on Thursday the assistant minister for immigration and border protection, Michaelia Cash, told the Senate the advice could not be revealed because it would “cause damage to national security”.</p> <p>“The significant threat of Ebola continues in west Africa and whilst the level of preparedness in our country is very high, we are continually assessing our response and limiting risk wherever possible … the government does not believe it is in the public interest to release the documents,” Cash said.</p> <p>Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young called for the refugee ban to be reversed.</p> <p>“The lack of compassion and cruelty on display in this move has shocked the international community. Australia is being held up to ridicule because of the minister’s heartless approach to people in need,” she said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Queensland premier, Campbell Newman, has written to Morrison asking him to order blanket screening by customs and quarantine officers for Ebola symptoms for all arrivals from affected west African countries. The Queensland health department would supply the thermometers and, in return, Newman would want passenger details to be shared with the state’s quarantine office and public health officials, who would then consider further tests.</p> <p>Nineteen people from four west-African families are in home isolation in Queensland. They arrived in the state on humanitarian visas earlier this month, and one, an 18-year-old woman, was temporarily hospitalised with a fever but tested negative to Ebola on Monday. The group has another four days in quarantine.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/29/maine-court-ebola-nurse-kaci-hickox <p>Maine’s top public health official has said the state will if necessary seek a court order to ensure a nurse stays quarantined in her home after returning from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Nurse Kaci Hickox, who tested negative for the disease on Saturday, said she would <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/29/maine-nurse-defiant-maine-ebola-quarantine">sue the state of Maine</a> if officials did not lift a home-quarantine order and allow her to move freely by Thursday morning, arguing that such a mandate violates her personal liberties.<br /></p> <p>Mary Mayhew, the commissioner of the state department of health and human services, pleaded with Hickox to abide by the state’s 21-day at-home quarantine order.</p> <p>“We do not want to legally enforce an in-home quarantine unless absolutely necessary,” Mayhew said on Wednesday afternoon. </p> <p>Mayhew described the quarantine as “voluntary”, but said her office would seek to use the courts to keep Hickox in her home if she tried to leave. Mayhew said the process to obtain a court order had begun by Wednesday evening. One of Hickox’s attorneys, New York City-based Norman Siegel, told the Today show that they would wait for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/maine">Maine</a> authorities to physically apprehend her before taking legal action.</p> <p>The governor’s office said in a statement that Maine state police would monitor Kickox’s home “for her protection and the health of the community”. A TV reporter with the local WLBZ news channel said <a href="https://twitter.com/KaitlynChana/status/527508752178892800">at 1pm ET</a> on Wednesday that at least two police cars were parked out front of the home.</p> <p>Hickox, 33, said she is concerned that the quarantine requirements, which go beyond the recommended federal guidelines for how to monitor travellers arriving from the west Africa, were predicated on fear, not science.</p> <p>“I don’t plan on sticking to the guidelines,” Hickox told the <a href="http://www.today.com/health/nurse-kaci-hickox-says-she-wont-obey-maines-ebola-quarantine-1D80251330">Today show from her home in Maine</a>. “I remain appalled by these home quarantine policies that have been forced upon me. I am in perfectly good health and feeling strong, and have been this entire time completely symptom-free.”</p> <p>“If the restrictions placed on me by the state of Maine are not lifted by Thursday morning, I will go to court to fight for my freedom,” she added.</p> <p>On Friday, the governors of New York and New Jersey declared a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/24/ebola-quarantine-new-york-new-jersey-west-africa">mandatory quarantine</a> for anyone arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea who had had contact with an Ebola sufferer. Just as the policy was introduced Hickox landed at Newark airport in New Jersey.<br /></p> <p>She was rushed to hospital after airport authorities detected that Hickox had a slightly <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/ebola-prevention-thermal-scanner-effective-placebo">elevated temperature</a>. At the hospital, an oral thermometer recorded a more accurate temperature of 98.6F. Despite testing negative for Ebola and displaying no symptoms, she was kept in an isolation tent with no access to a shower or television. From confinement, she published a scathing letter in the Dallas Morning News about her treatment. Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, released her on Monday, and she returned to her home in Maine.</p> <p>Maine officials are asking Hickox to stay at home for the duration of her three-week isolation period, which ends on 10 November. Those infected with the Ebola virus may not develop symptoms until up to 21 days after exposure. However, people infected with Ebola are not infectious until they become symptomatic, typically after developing a fever and, even then, those infected can only spread the virus through body fluids, such as blood or vomit.</p> <p>New York and New Jersey’s mandatory 21-day quarantine policy inspired similar requirements in states across the US, despite widespread criticism from the medical establishment and the White House that the orders are unnecessary, burdensome and could deter healthcare workers from volunteering in the region. </p> <p>“We have to keep in mind that if we’re discouraging our healthcare workers, who are prepared to make these sacrifices, from traveling to these places in need, then we’re not doing our job in terms of looking after our own public health and safety,” <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/29/ebola-obama-health-workers-who-decline-transmission-liberia-video">President Barack Obama said on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Jessica Glenza</em></p>

The aid organisation argues that because tours typically range from four to six weeks, and an additional three-week quarantine is a significant burden on healthcare volunteers.</p> <p>Publications such as the <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1413139">New England Journal of Medicine have also jumped into the fray</a>, saying that such orders are “like driving a carpet tack with a sledgehammer”.</p> <p>The approach “is not scientifically based, is unfair and unwise, and will impede essential efforts to stop these awful outbreaks of Ebola disease at their source, which is the only satisfactory goal”, the editorial said of the 21-day isolation requirements. </p> <p>People infected with the Ebola virus may not show symptoms for up to 21 days, spurring the calls by politicians for a three-week isolation period. However, people with the disease are not infectious until they are symptomatic, typically after developing a fever. Even then, those infected can only spread Ebola through body fluids, such as blood or vomit. The disease is not airborne. </p> <p>The day before Hickox was detained in Newark airport, a New York City doctor, Craig Spencer, was diagnosed with Ebola. The doctor took at least three trips on the subway, dined out and went bowling, spurring public anxiety. </p> <p>“Do you understand what that did to the psyche of public officials in a metropolis of nine million people,” the Today show host Matt Lauer asked Hickox. </p> <p>“Of course I do understand, it has created a lot of fear, but we still have to make policies based on evidence,” Hickox said. </p>
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/29/us-troops-ebola-face-21-day-quarantine-low-risk <p>US military personnel returning from anti-Ebola efforts in west Africa will be subject to a stricter quarantine than recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Pentagon announced on Wednesday.<br /></p> <p>The defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/28/conflicting-ebola-guidelines-defense-secretary">approved a plan from US military commanders</a> for a “controlled monitoring regimen” lasting 21 days for troops deployed to Liberia and Senegal to help contain the outbreak. Over 3,900 service members are expected to join that effort, currently totalling 700, in the coming weeks. None of them come in direct contact with Ebola patients. </p> <p>About a dozen US soldiers led by Major General Darryl Williams, who represented the initial complement of US troops sent to west Africa, are currently quarantined at a base in Vicenza, Italy. Hagel’s decision expands the prospective quarantine to troops across all military branches who take part in the anti-Ebola mission.</p> <p>The new military quarantine rules place US service members under tighter monitoring conditions than the CDC consider prudent. This week, the CDC issued guidelines instructing only “high-risk” individuals, such as those who are exposed to Ebola-infected body fluids, to quarantine at home.</p> <p>US personnel serving in what the military calls Operation United Assistance would not be classified as “high-risk” under the CDC’s new Ebola guidelines.</p> <p>Hagel instructed the heads of the military services to prepare specific implementation plans for a quarantine within 15 days. The Pentagon said Hagel would review the quarantine after 45 days and decide then if continuing the quarantines are appropriate.</p> <p>Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, characterized what he called Hagel’s “initial steps” as “prudent given the large number of military personnel transiting from their home base and west Africa and the unique logistical demands and impact this deployment has on the force”.</p> <p>Rep Buck McKeon, the California Republican who chairs the House armed services committee, cautiously praised the quarantine as “the right call” for the time being.</p> <p>“I hope DoD can find a way to balance the concerns about health and safety while minimizing the burden on overtaxed troops on what could be a long deployment, but their safety and well being must be paramount,” McKeon said Wednesday.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/29/ebola-turning-point-rich-world-urgency-end-of-beginning <p>The news from Guinea and Sierra Leone has been unrelentingly horrific. Despite encouraging signs from Liberia, overall things will get worse. Today the official toll of the Ebola epidemic reached <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-who-ebola-numbers-20141029-story.html" title="">13,703 cases</a>, though the true figure is higher. By Christmas there may be thousands of new cases every week. More countries will probably report introduced <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/09/ebola-highly-contagious-virus-myths-outbreak-epidemic" title="">infections</a>, as in the US and, more worryingly, African neighbours. Several bleak months lie ahead.</p> <p>Yet through this darkness it is finally becoming possible to see some light. In the past 10 days the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/17/isis-ebola-twin-threats-islamic-state" title="">international community</a> has belatedly begun to take the actions necessary to start turning Ebola’s tide. The progress is preliminary and uncertain; even if ultimately successful it will not reduce mortality or stop transmission for some time. We are not close to seeing the beginning of the end of the epidemic. But three developments offer hope that we may have reached the end of the beginning.</p> <p>The first advance has been a step change in urgency from the rich world, which is finally starting to commit resources and people on the scale required. The first priority in containing Ebola is breaking the chain of infection, by ensuring that people who have or might have it are isolated, while being treated with respect and dignity; and that if they die their bodies are disposed of safely and with cultural sensitivity.</p> <p>Trust has to be re-established between communities and authorities. The people of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are making heroic efforts, but need help: clinical facilities to hold and treat confirmed and suspected cases, and trained people to run them. Deployments by the UK, the US, China, Cuba and France are now starting to add capacity, hitherto left to charities such as Médecins Sans Frontières.</p> <p>Major recent investments, including an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-secures-1-billion-european-ebola-commitment" title="">EU contribution that has almost doubled to €1bn</a> and large UK and US donations, mean that money should no longer be a barrier. The <a href="http://www.who.int/en/" title="">World Health Organisation</a>, so slow to recognise and respond to Ebola’s threat, is now showing leadership and coordinating these efforts.</p> <p>There is also good progress in the search for treatments. A therapy that improves survival would not directly reduce transmission, though it would have immense humanitarian value. It could nonetheless play a vital indirect role. A key to controlling Ebola is persuading more people who have had contact with a patient, or who have symptoms, to seek medical care. At the moment, they have few incentives to do so. A better therapy, even trials of one, would make a real difference. Such trials are now close to beginning.</p> <p>A team supported by the Wellcome Trust has made a successful visit to the affected countries, visiting communities and clinics to discuss trials, and is now almost ready to start work. Another group in Antwerp has been funded to assess a serum made from the blood of Ebola survivors. A sticking point was overcome last week by a WHO ethics meeting, which agreed that trials need not follow the standard placebo-controlled model: this can be unethical and impractical in an epidemic context.</p> <p>Finally, and potentially most significantly, vaccine development has changed up a gear. While public health remains pivotal to containing Ebola, the outbreak is so advanced that this might not be enough. A safe and effective vaccine could transform the situation. Just a few weeks ago, there was widespread scepticism that one could be produced in time. There is now agreement from industry, governments, philanthropy and regulators that this can and must be done.</p> <p>Mass production of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/29/possible-ebola-vaccine-human-trials" title="">three vaccine candidates</a> will now proceed in parallel with trials, so that if results are promising, hundreds of thousands of doses could be deployed in the first half of 2015. The costs must be shared even if trials fail, and liability and trial design issues are being resolved. If one or more of these vaccines is viable, west Africa must get it quickly enough to make it count.</p> <p>This progress does not justify complacency. While the elements of a successful containment strategy are starting to crystallise, huge challenges lie ahead. We should also be advancing with still greater urgency and ambition. The accelerated schedule for vaccine deployment, for instance, rests on conservative projections that could be beaten given sufficient will, and provided we clear logistical and regulatory hurdles now. If science shows a vaccine to be safe and effective, issues such as customs, shipping or refrigeration cannot delay it.</p> <p>The pressure must not let up. The constructive diplomacy of recent days has not saved a single life, nor protected anybody from infection. The epidemic’s exponential curve means it will get worse before they get better. We have not yet begun to control Ebola, and the new interventions could yet fail. But if the world lives up to its promises, the past week may come to be seen as the turning point.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/29/possible-ebola-vaccine-human-trials <p>A third potential Ebola vaccine could be tested on healthworkers in west Africa in December following the announcement of funding to speed it through its first-ever human safety trials.</p> <p>The vaccine, called rVSV-EBOV, was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. So far it has been tested only in monkeys, but in the hope that it could prove effective, 800 vials have been donated by the Canadian government. The safety trials – in which people at no risk of catching Ebola are vaccinated to ensure there are no serious side-effects – will start imminently in Germany, Switzerland, Gabon and Kenya.</p> <p>The Wellcome Trust is donating £3.1m to enable the collection of safety data, overseen by the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>“Several crucial pieces of the jigsaw are falling into place in terms of the global leadership and action required to turn this epidemic around,” said Prof Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. “Communities in west Africa continue to suffer from the crisis with remarkable fortitude and finally the rich world has committed significant finance and resources to support critical public health measures, and progress in the search for treatments is encouraging.</p> <p>“Now, accelerated vaccine development is being properly prioritised too, so we have the best possible chance of a safe and effective vaccine in time to transform our prospects of containing Ebola.”</p> <p>The Wellcome Trust’s experts describe the VSV vaccine candidate as one of the most promising. There are two others that are more advanced in clinical trials – one made by the British pharmaceuticals company GlaxoSmithKline and the other by Johnson &amp; Johnson in the US. Both will move into trials in west Africa, probably in health workers and burial teams, in December.</p> <p>The Canadian vaccine uses a weakened form of live vesicular stomatitis virus, a pathogen found in livestock that has been used in other vaccines and elicits a strong response from the body’s immune system. It will have been modified so that the gene for the outer protein of VSV is replaced with a segment of the gene for the outer protein of the Zaire Ebola virus species.</p> <p>Although it is expected to produce a good immune response against the Ebola virus, there are questions over the possible side-effects, which could include fever – one of the earliest symptoms of Ebola and also malaria.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2014/oct/ebola/#map" data-alt="Ebola map"> <a href="http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2014/oct/ebola/#map">Ebola map</a> </figure>
http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/29/mobile-phone-records-help-fight-against-ebola-study-finds <p>Mobile phone records could provide more accurate and up-to-date information than traditional census methods for keeping track of populations around the world, according to new research. </p> <p>They could even be used to help tackle crisis situations such as the spread of Ebola, a report said. </p> <p>A study by an international team, including the University of Southampton, has found that maps made using mobile records are detailed, reliable and flexible enough to help inform infrastructure and emergency planners particularly in low income countries, where recent population density information is often scarce. </p> <p>The Southampton geographer and senior author on the study, Dr Andy Tatem, said: “Proving the resilience and accuracy of using mobile phone records to map populations was crucial for us, as it has many advantages over traditional census information. </p> <p>“At the moment mapping of populations is constrained by the logistics of census surveys, which just provide a single snapshot of population distributions every 10 years. </p> <p>“However, anonymous phone data can be examined regularly to map daily, weekly or monthly changes across an entire country, at less cost and with greater flexibility. </p> <p>“Every time a person uses a mobile it sends information to a receiving tower and gives an approximate location of where they are. When this information is repeated multiple times, over millions of users, we can extract a detailed picture of population density and how it changes over time in a given area.” </p> <p>The team, led by the Universite catholique de Louvain and the Universite libre de Bruxelles and working as part of the WorldPop Project and Flowminder Foundation used the anonymised mobile phone records of 19 million users in Portugal and France, for several months in 2007 and 2008, to generate maps showing the densities of users in different geographic areas. </p> <p>These maps were found to be as accurate as traditional census-based maps, which the researchers generated from data from the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies of France and the National Institute of Statistics of Portugal. </p> <p>Furthermore, by combining the mobile and census information with data from satellite imagery, the spatial resolution and accuracy of the census-based maps was greatly improved. </p> <p>Dr Tatem said: “Knowing where people are is critical for accurate impact assessments and intervention planning, particularly for issues such as healthcare, food security, climate change, wars and natural disasters. </p> <p>“Mobile phone network subscription rates globally are now at 96% and anonymous call record data can give us information from a wide-range of countries – high, middle and low income alike. In particular, it can give us detailed information from regions where census data is either non-existent, outdated or very unreliable.” </p> <p>But the research does raise privacy concerns. In March, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/13/phone-call-metadata-does-betray-sensitive-details-about-your-life-study">researchers at Stanford University</a> proved that merely examining metadata from mobile phones can lead to uncomfortable insights. For instance, one subject “had a long, early morning call with her sister. Two days later, she placed a series of calls to the local Planned Parenthood location. She placed brief additional calls two weeks later, and made a final call a month after.”</p> <p>And in June, researchers warned that a similar dataset, of anonymised taxi journeys, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/27/new-york-taxi-details-anonymised-data-researchers-warn">could be easily de-anonymised</a>, risking the privacy of both drivers and passengers. “Anonymising data is really hard,” explained researcher Vijay Pandurangan, who expressed doubts it was possible to ever release a sizeable anonymous dataset without at least the risk of someone reverse-engineering it and uncovering private information.</p> <p>Dr Tatem and colleagues are already extending their mapping work to low income regions and have used mobile phone-based mobility mapping to help combat malaria more effectively in Namibia. </p> <p>They have improved the targeting of malaria interventions by identifying communities most at risk. Most recently they have used mobile data to help inform authorities tracking and preparing for the spread of ebola in West Africa. </p> <p>The paper Dynamic Population Mapping Using Mobile Phone Data is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/29/hiv-aids-west-africa-health-investment-ebola <p>West Africa, now in the throes of a calamitous Ebola epidemic, missed out on significant health investment over the past decade or more because it had low rates of HIV, a detailed survey of the changing health of Africa and Asia reveals.</p> <p>A major project called Indepth, which has looked at the causes of death of more than 110,000 people in 13 countries shows that health improved generally in those given substantial international aid to try to turn around the HIV and Aids epidemic. But west Africa, with severe poverty and low healthcare standards but relatively little HIV, did not benefit.</p> <p>“In most parts of Africa, health systems have been strengthened by the external funding of HIV,” said Dr Jimmy Whitworth, head of population health at the Wellcome Trust which funded the project. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/08/bush-memoirs-aids-foreign-policy" title="">Pepfar</a> (the US President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief) and other agencies invested in health clinics and staff in order to make it possible for thousands of Africans in Aids and HIV-hit countries such as Kenya to be tested and given antiretroviral drugs to keep them alive and well.</p> <p>“There was a view at one stage that HIV care would crowd out other illnesses and they would get worse,” said Whitworth – but that did not happen. Instead, healthcare became a higher political priority in countries such as Rwanda and Kenya and improved across the board over time.</p> <p>But no such improvement occurred in Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea. “In west Africa it is most stark,” said Whitworth. “I used to work in Sierra Leone in the late 80s. The health services were pretty poor at that time. Since then, they have gone through civil war with everything collapsing. They have been rebuilding since the civil war ended so some improvement has been made, but I don’t think the health systems have been strengthened very much.”</p> <p>Just as Aids focused minds and money 15 years ago, so Ebola should now. Whitworth said he hoped that as healthcare in west Africa now had the world’s attention, it could keep it. “Otherwise we’re left as a global community with a real achilles heel with inadequate services,” he said.</p> <p>The Indepth project is an unprecedented exploration of the causes of death in communities where no records are kept. Hundreds of researchers carried out interviews over two decades to establish how people died. They conducted verbal autopsies, interviewing family members in a structured way about the illness and last days of the deceased. The data, collected in 22 sites, each containing around 100,000 people, were then computer processed to establish the likely cause of death.</p> <p>Most studies that publish death rates from diseases around the world use official figures from hospitals, but deaths in rural villages are missed and there are no death certificates issued in rural Africa.</p> <p>The data comes to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/may/29/uk-western-europe-obesity-study" title="">similar conclusions to the Global Burden of Disease study</a> on the toll taken by malaria, TB, HIV and maternal and child mortality. But it shows a great deal of variability between one region and another - and investment in healthcare appears to be a factor.</p> <p>Deaths of women in pregnancy and labour and child deaths are consistently high across Africa and Asia. Children’s drownings in Bangladesh and homicide among adult men in eastern and southern Africa are also causes for concern, the authors say.</p> <p>The data is being published in a <a href="http://www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/issue/view/1602#INDEPTH%20Network%20Cause-Specific%20Mortality" title="">special issue of the journal Global Health Action</a>, which is open access.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/28/ebola-state-by-state-screening-quarantine-monitoring <p>Since the diagnosis of Craig Spencer with Ebola in New York last week, states around the US have introduced a flurry of new policies on how to monitor those returning from west Africa’s most affected countries.</p> <p>That’s resulted in a patchwork of rules for those flying into the US from the Ebola-ravaged west African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/27/ban-ki-moon-concerned-ebola-restrictions">published</a> new guidelines on Monday. But with ambitious governors mindful of public fear over Ebola, some states have enacted tighter restrictions.</p> <h2>New York &amp; New Jersey</h2> <p>At a press conference, the governors of New York and New Jersey on Friday declared a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/24/ebola-quarantine-new-york-new-jersey-west-africa">mandatory quarantine</a> for anyone arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea who had had contact with an Ebola sufferer. Just as the policy was introduced, a nurse, Kaci Hickox, landed at Newark airport in New Jersey. She ended up in isolation in a New Jersey hospital despite testing negative for Ebola, and published a scathing letter in the Dallas Morning News about her treatment on Saturday. </p> <p>The efficacy of such a mandatory quarantine was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/27/ban-ki-moon-concerned-ebola-restrictions">criticised</a> by the White House, the UN, public health experts, aid groups and civil liberties advocates. </p> <p>Questions still remain over the specifics of the Ebola quarantine policy. The governors under pressure appeared to soften their stances on the hastily drafted policy in the days since it was introduced, even though both say they have not.</p> <p>Anyone arriving at John F Kennedy airport in New York or Newark airport in New Jersey from the three countries will pass through three layers of screening that will determine who should be quarantined. </p> <p>Travellers who arrive from one of the countries and have symptoms of the Ebola virus will be immediately transported to a designated hospital and placed in isolation, according to a fact sheet distributed by the office of Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York on Sunday. </p> <p>Those who are asymptomatic but have had direct contact with an Ebola sufferer can carry out their three-week quarantine at home. Although, on Friday, Cuomo said high-risk travellers could be quarantined at a “government regulated facility”. The fact sheet said accommodations would be made for those without homes in New York. </p> <p>On Monday, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey also said asymptomatic travellers who had contact with Ebola sufferers could carry out their quarantines at their homes, wherever in the country that may be.</p> <p>“If you are screened and you are asymptomatic, you can be allowed then to go to your home, travel to your home, whether it’s in New Jersey, New York or someplace else in the country and be quarantined for 21 days there,” he told reporters.</p> <p>Under quarantine, health officials will make two unannounced visits each day to take the traveller’s temperature and check for symptoms. New York state said it will provide financial assistance to quarantined healthcare workers and adults whose employers will not compensate them while they are not allowed to work during this three-week period. It is not clear if this is the case for those quarantined in New Jersey.</p> <p>Asymptomatic travellers who did not have direct contact with Ebola patients will be handled on a case-by-case basis, the fact sheet said. </p> <h2>Virginia &amp; Maryland </h2> <p>On Monday, the governors of <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=7004">Virginia</a> and <a href="http://www.governor.maryland.gov/blog/?p=11030">Maryland</a> announced that all travellers arriving from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone will be actively monitored by public health officials. </p> <p>Travellers arriving from those three countries at Dulles international airport, outside Washington DC in Virginia, already undergo screenings for the disease. Dulles is the third of five airports in the US through which passengers travelling from the region must enter.</p> <p>The states’ new policies require airport screeners to provide local health departments with passengers’ contact information so officials can follow up with them about their health. Such passengers will be asked to record their temperature twice daily and report to local health officials for a 21-day period.</p> <p>The policy says a traveller who develops an Ebola-like symptom, such as a fever, but does not test positive for the virus, may still be asked to quarantine for the remainder of their three-week incubation period.</p> <h2>Illinois </h2> <p>On Friday, the state’s health department issued a <a href="http://www.idph.state.il.us/public/press14/10.27.14_IDPH_Issues_Ebola_Safety_Guidance.htm">memo</a> that calls for travellers with a high risk of exposure to the virus to be issued with a formal 21-day home quarantine order. The memo said the updated policy was to offer local health departments guidance on how to follow up with travellers who are screened for the disease upon arrival at Chicago’s O’Hare International, the fourth designated US airport for those coming from west Africa.</p> <p>The state’s health department identifies “high risk” individuals as those who have had direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an Ebola sufferer or the body of someone who died from the virus. There is an exemption for healthcare workers who wore appropriate personal protective gear and had no known lapse of infection control protocol while treating patients. But those healthcare workers who did not wearing proper protective clothing, or were exposed to the virus via a needle or other injury, will be quarantined in their homes.</p> <h2>Georgia </h2> <p>On Monday, Georgia’s governor, Nathan Deal, updated the state’s monitoring policy for travellers returning from the most affected region of Africa, adding measures that go beyond what the CDC recommends. (Georgia is home to the fifth designated airport for west Africa arrivals: Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta.)</p> <p>Such passengers are placed in a quarantine station where officials take their temperatures and check for symptoms. If travellers show symptoms, they will be isolated immediately and transferred to a designated hospital for evaluation.</p> <p>Asymptomatic travellers returning from the region are divided into three categories: high-risk, low-risk and medical personnel.</p> <p>High-risk travellers, those known to have had direct exposure to the Ebola virus, will be subject to a 21-day quarantine at a designated isolation facility; low-risk travellers, those with no known exposure to the disease, must take their temperature and check for symptoms twice daily and report their status to a public health official once a day. Those who don’t comply with the daily reporting requirement will be tracked down and could be issued with a mandatory quarantine order.</p> <p>Healthcare workers who have cared for Ebola patients will be monitored daily by public health officials either by video or in-home visits for a three-week period. </p> <h2>Florida </h2> <p>On Saturday, Florida’s Governor Rick Scott signed a strict executive order mandating twice-daily 21-day health monitoring by state health officials for people returning from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, regardless of whether the travellers show symptoms or not.</p> <p>Travellers from these countries will face a risk assessment upon their arrival in Florida, as well as active monitoring by state health officials. </p> <p>Scott said he decided to move ahead with the order when the CDC failed to respond to a request for more information on the risk levels posed by travellers returning from the region. Passengers cannot travel directly from west Africa to Florida.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/28/conflicting-ebola-guidelines-defense-secretary <p>The Ebola outbreak has placed the US secretary of defense on the horns of a dilemma: whether to back the military service chiefs about a quarantine for troops or to support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommends no such thing. </p> <p>Defense chief Chuck Hagel has received a recommendation for a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/29/us-troops-ebola-face-21-day-quarantine-low-risk">“quarantine-like program”</a> for all US servicemembers returning from Liberia and Senegal, where they are supporting civilian efforts to contain the disease, Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said on Tuesday. </p> <p>The recommendation, made by the heads of the military services, would expand across the military a directive made on Monday from the army chief, General Raymond Odierno, to keep soldiers returning from Operation United Assistance in Liberia and Senegal under a 21-day period of “controlled monitoring”.</p> <p>Kirby said Hagel has yet to make a decision, having received the quarantine recommendation earlier on Tuesday. But imposing a broader military quarantine for returning servicemembers goes beyond <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/27/ban-ki-moon-concerned-ebola-restrictions">new guidance set on Monday</a> by the CDC, which urged a home quarantine only for high-risk individuals, such as those whose body fluids have been directly exposed to Ebola. US troops have not been involved in treating Ebola patients.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="d5713ec80f039ee35e015c5046adb1a30042ac25"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/28/1414527251313/80c5da6f-4cd2-40ce-b5e5-933674f344e5-460x276.jpeg" alt="US army Ebola training" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">A US army soldier before being deployed to Africa as part of the US military’s response to the Ebola crisis.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In effect, Hagel’s choice involves rebuking either scientists who seek to control a potential outbreak without provoking fear or rebuking the military leadership on an issue of troop safety.<br /></p> <p>The military has sent 700 servicemembers into west Africa, mostly in Liberia, to build field medical facilities, set up staging areas for inserting and distributing supplies, and support the US Agency for International Development. The Pentagon said on Saturday that “upwards of 3,900 personnel” will be deployed to west Africa in the coming weeks. <br /></p> <p>Army Major General Darryl Williams, who led the initial military mission, has now been placed in quarantine with the dozen soldiers returning with him from Africa. They are to remain at an army base in Vicenza, Italy, for the next 21 days, away from their families, before returning to the United States.

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/28/mali-rushes-contain-ebola-first-case <p>At around 10am last Wednesday, Abdouramane Koungoulba, the duty paediatrician at the Fousseyni Dao hospital in Kayes, western Mali, examined a young patient who had been brought in by a relative. The two-year-old girl, he noted, had a high fever and a nosebleed.</p> <p>The relative told the doctor the girl had been born and brought up in Mali. What they did not mention was that she had just returned from neighbouring Guinea, where she had been staying with her father before he died. Nor did he reveal that she and her grandmother had made the 600-mile journey from Guinea to Kayes, via the Malian capital, Bamako, on public buses.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Map of the journey from Kissidougou to Kayes via Mali’s capital, Bamako, undertaken by the girl and her grandmother">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1414568300041/Mali_ebola.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> <figcaption>The journey from Kissidougou to Kayes via Mali’s capital, Bamako, undertaken by the girl and her grandmother</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later that day, the toddler’s family did tell Koungoulba about the girl’s trip across the border to Kissidougou, the Guinean town where the west African outbreak began eight months ago. “It was not until I learned she had recently been to Guinea that I took my initial suspicions seriously, that this was Mali’s first reported case of Ebola,” says the doctor, a soft-spoken man in his 30s.</p> <p>Realising the enormity of the situation, Koungoulba alerted the rapid response team in the Malian capital, Bamako, and dispatched a sample of the girl’s blood for immediate testing. By Thursday evening, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/mali-first-ebola-case" title="">Mali had confirmed its first case of the virus</a> that has killed nearly 5,000 people. A few hours later, less than two days after she was admitted, the girl died.</p> <p>The authorities in Kayes moved equally swiftly. As Malians followed news of the case on television, a regional government car was speeding towards Bamako to intercept the bus that had brought the girl to Kayes before it returned to the capital.</p> <p>In the early hours of Friday, about halfway between the two cities, the bus was spotted. “They literally chased down the bus, made the passengers get out, and disinfected the whole vehicle in the middle of the road,” says Shannon Strother of Unicef.</p> <p>In the meantime, the job of tracing the girl’s route and working out how many people she may have come into contact with had begun. Most worrying, according to Malian health officials, was the revelation that the girl had been showing symptoms of Ebola on her bus journey. “It’s worrying, especially since she was travelling by bus,” says Dr Samba Sow from the National Centre for Disease Control (CNAM) in Bamako.</p> <p>By visiting the villages and towns through which the girl and her grandmother had passed, health workers have so far identified dozens of possible contacts. “From the passenger list, where people had put down their phone numbers, we were able to identify and track all the people travelling on the bus,” says Dr Lamine Diarra at the health ministry in Bamako. However, he added, the hunt had been complicated by the fact that in parts of Mali, a whole village shares the same Sim card.</p> <p>According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 116 people in Mali are now being held under observation for the disease.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2014/oct/ebola/#map" data-alt="Ebola outbreaks over time"> <a href="http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2014/oct/ebola/#map">Ebola outbreaks over time</a> </figure>  <p>The authorities are concentrating their efforts on Kayes, a town of 128,000 inhabitants, which sits in the south-west of the country not far from the border with Senegal. To the south is Guinea, where the outbreak began this year. Given the two countries’ porous border and Kayes importance as a mining and trading region that sees workers crossing the border daily, Mali has long been seen as a potential weak point in the regional epidemic.</p> <p>In Kayes – where 57 people who had contact with the girl are isolated and being monitored at the hospital or in their homes – there is anxiety and suspicion.</p> <p>“They come and take our temperature twice a day,” says a woman who does not give her name for fear of the stigma associated with the disease.</p> <p>Some Kayes residents wear masks; others use protective gloves. But almost everyone avoids handshakes when greeting friends and family, instead bumping elbows or moving a hand towards the heart. Last weekend, healthcare workers complained they hadn’t been trained to deal with Ebola cases.</p> <p>“It’s true that some of the staff were concerned and even threatened to stop working. The problem was solved when religious leaders were called in to mediate,” says Dr Koumare Toumani, director general of the Kayes hospital.</p> <p>Sow arrived in Kayes last Friday to lead the Ebola response in the region. Over the weekend health workers and volunteers were trained to trace anyone who had been in contact with the girl. “If you have one case very early on and you catch it, you’re actually lucky,” he says. “If you don’t detect that first case, you run the risk of people who are contagious staying in the community without being reported – and that’s when you run the risk of an epidemic.”</p> <p>Four days after the death of the little girl, regional government officials are confident that all the people who came in contact with her have now been identified. By Tuesday a centre for diagnostics and observation built by Unicef was in place at the hospital, and screenings at the border with Senegal will be reinforced over the next days.</p> <p>“It’s true we were taken by surprise by having a case here in Kayes,” says Toumani. “The structures to trace and monitor Ebola cases were not yet in place. Now, with the help of NGOs coming from Bamako, we are setting up the infrastructure to receive and isolate more patients.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the hospital’s paediatrics department, Koungoulba thinks about his patient and Ebola protocol. “Did I really follow all the safety precautions in treating the girl?” he asks. “Did I touch her soiled nappy? Did I wipe the blood running from her nose? These are questions I ask myself over and over again.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/28/nurse-new-jersey-returns-home-ebola-quarantine <p>Quarantining healthcare workers who have treated Ebola patients in west Africa won’t stop the disease from coming to the United States – only halting the viral outbreak abroad can do that.</p> <p>That was President Barack Obama’s message on Tuesday, after governors in several states enacted strict quarantine orders for healthcare workers, and after New Jersey released a Maine nurse who was held against her will for three days, 600 miles from home.</p> <p>“We don’t want to discourage our health care workers from going to the front lines and dealing with this in an effective way,” said Obama. “If we don’t have robust international response in west Africa, then we are actually endangering ourselves here back home.” </p> <p>In a separate event on Tuesday, a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/27/nurse-ebola-quarantine-released-newark">nurse released from an Ebola quarantine tent in a New Jersey hospital</a> was making her 600-mile journey home to Maine. But how much freedom Kaci Hickox will have in the final two weeks of her quarantine period remains unclear.</p> <p>Under Maine’s state guidelines, healthcare workers returning from one of the three west African countries worst affected by the Ebola outbreak must be quarantined for 21 days in their homes. Hickox is the first to be subject to such a measure. The state has not said whether the quarantine is voluntary, or how it might be enforced. </p> <p>“We certainly understand healthcare workers’ desire to get home after doing good work in west Africa,” said the Maine governor, Paul LePage. “But we must be vigilant in our duty to protect the health and safety of all Mainers, as well as anyone who may come in contact with someone who has been exposed to Ebola.”</p> <p>Everyone returning to Maine from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone will undergo daily monitoring. Effectively, that means people returning from the countries will be called by the Maine health department daily. Returning healthcare workers will have to check their temperature twice a day, receive daily calls and remain in their homes.</p> <p>Those infected with Ebola show symptoms within 21 days, and only when symptomatic are patients contagious. The disease is spread through body fluids, such as vomit or blood. Many believe mandatory quarantine measures could remand healthy, asymptomatic workers to their homes when they are at no risk of infecting others. </p> <p>“Public health [policies] are not arbitrary. They’re built on what we know about the virus and how it’s transmitted,” said Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert from the Vanderbilt University school of medicine. “I, at least, find no real scientific reason to oblige people who’ve come back from west Africa to be quarantined in their home, to have their movements curtailed, to have their civil liberties curtailed, if they have no real symptoms and if they’re in a monitoring programme.”</p> <p>State guidelines <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/26/white-house-christie-cuomo-ebola-quarantine">have evolved quickly</a> over the last week. New quarantine measures have been variously announced by both politicians and health departments. While new policies look to curb anxiety, not all are entirely transparent or based on science.</p> <p>The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/27/ban-ki-moon-concerned-ebola-restrictions">issued new guidance on Monday</a>, recommending six states undertake active monitoring programmes. Effectively, this means health departments call returning travellers once a day, and require those in direct contact with Ebola patients report their temperatures. Those six states – New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and Georgia – receive about 70% of travelers from Ebola affected areas in Africa.</p> <p>Some states do not believe the CDC’s guidelines are enough. </p> <p>Hickox was quarantined in an in-hospital tent in the confusion following New Jersey’s policy change. Hickox flew into Newark airport on Friday following volunteer work in Sierra Leone. The nurse was questioned and held at the airport in Newark for almost seven hours before being placed into mandatory quarantine in the city’s University hospital. Though Hickox was released, it is unclear whether the policy has officially changed. </p> <p>Hickox is suing on the grounds that the mandatory quarantine violated her civil rights and was scientifically unfounded. While she was allowed to leave the hospital, the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, maintains he has not changed the policy.</p> <p>The mandatory quarantine measures have exposed two conflicting needs: to counter public concern, and the need to recruit volunteer healthcare workers to the fight against Ebola in west Africa.</p> <p>“There are other ways to adequately address both public anxiety and health imperatives,” said Sophie Delaunay, executive director of Doctors Without Borders in a statement on Monday. She said that adding a three-week quarantine period to normal tours of between four and six weeks could severely hamper recruitment efforts. </p> <p>“The response to Ebola must not be guided primarily by panic in countries not overly affected by the epidemic,” Delaunay said. “Any regulation not based on scientific medical grounds, which would isolate healthy aid workers, will very likely serve as a disincentive to others to combat the epidemic at its source, in west Africa.”</p> <p>Across the country, public health experts have attempted to assuage public concern.</p> <p>“The only way we will truly be able to keep our citizens safe is to control the outbreak in west Africa,” said Dr Bruce Ribner, an infectious disease expert at Emory university hospital, during a press conference, Tuesday. The hospital successfully treated Amber Vinson, a Dallas nurse who contracted Ebola when she treated Thomas Duncan, the first patient to be diagnosed with the virus in the US.</p> <p>“We have to be very mindful of any undetected consequences which may make it more difficult to manage patients in the African continent,” said Ribner.<br /></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/28/what-to-read-about-ebola-books <p>Google “Ebola” now and you’ll be confronted with a boxed message from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the top of the page and a slew of nutty headlines below it. For those of you, like me, who feel helpless in the face of big phenomena we do not understand – say, you know, an infectious disease whose symptoms and lethalness are straight out of a Michael Crichton novel – reading can be a consolation. But it’s hard to string-stitch much comfort from the alarmist tabloid press, WebMD, Wikipedia, and the odd PDF of an epidemiology paper.<br /></p> <p>You’d think that books about Ebola written for the more general public should be an obvious place to seek the kind of security blanket you’re looking for. Unfortunately we’re a bit thin on the ground there too, with one exception.</p> <p>On the one hand, that’s self-publishing’s fault. Search for Ebola on Amazon and you’ll wade through a pack of self-published books by doomsday preppers who are convinced that the CDC is hiding the true spread of the outbreak from the American public. They have titles like Ebola: Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid and The Ebola Outbreak: How to Prepare, Protect, Diagnose, Treat, and Survive an Ebola Pandemic. The helpful “tips” such books provide include careful instructions on corpse disposal. This is all grimly amusing stuff, and proof positive that a certain paranoid slice of the American public is descending into panic. But not really <em>reassuring</em> per se.</p> <p>So, better to stick to the actual published journalistic books about the matter. But they’re rather thin on the ground at the moment, and have their own drawbacks, too.</p> <p>All current writing on Ebola has to reckon with a single, largely outdated book: <a href="http://richardpreston.net/preston-books/hot-zone">Richard Preston’s The Hot Zone</a>, an instant No1 bestseller when it was published in 1994. It is, as a matter of fact, on the bestseller list again right now, and the New Yorker (which long ago published the piece that led to the book) has been publishing Preston’s reporting on the current crisis. The magazine stuff is pretty good; last week came <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/ebola-wars">a long, sober piece</a> surveying the use of the experimental treatment ZMapp. As Preston points out, ZMapp seems like it could provide at least partial treatment for the infected, though it is not being produced in sufficient quantities to resolve the pandemic.</p> <p>But if that piece has tempted you to turn to The Hot Zone now to learn about Ebola, keep in mind it’s been over 20 years since it was published. Even Preston<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/books/the-hot-zone-author-tracks-ebolas-evolution.html"> told the </a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/books/the-hot-zone-author-tracks-ebolas-evolution.html">New York Times</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/books/the-hot-zone-author-tracks-ebolas-evolution.html"> recently</a> that he thinks it needs updating. While early chapters do describe the ravages Ebola can make on the human body, the book is largely about an Ebola outbreak among monkeys in Reston, Virginia. The fear at the time was that Ebola was possibly airborne; that fear has now been more or less definitively allayed. </p> <p>Both epidemiologists and literary critics have grumbled about the way Preston’s breathless style amplified and distorted the true nature of the disease. He likes to pepper his prose with horror-movie bits like: “He is becoming an automaton. Tiny spots in his brain are liquifying.” Malcolm Gladwell, <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118972/ebola-virus-obsession">reviewing the book for </a>t<a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118972/ebola-virus-obsession">he New Republic</a><em> </em>in 1994, had his reservations about what he said was an admittedly riveting style that recalled Michael Crichton:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Of course, The Hot Zone is a true story and The Andromeda Strain is not. But there are conventions of fear in modern American culture, and there is no denying The Hot Zone is written, in style and substance, in self-conscious imitation of a sci-fi thriller. This is one of the things that makes the book so exciting. It is also what makes the book occasionally dishonest.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gladwell took particular issue with the book’s focus on Ebola’s connection to a single cave in Africa, when in fact there was never any reason to believe the cave was some kind of origin point for the virus. What it was was a good set piece for Preston to do a little stunt journalism by going into the cave himself, even though such swashbuckling tells the reader little new about Ebola.</p> <p>A much more thorough primer, actually, came earlier this month from the science writer David Quammen. A short, quick read of a book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ebola-Natural-Human-History-Deadly/dp/0393351556/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414413962">Ebola: the Natural and Human History of a Deadly Virus</a> is more up-to-date than The Hot Zone if also less compellingly written. The book is actually a hastily updated extract of the section on Ebola from an earlier book of Quammen’s, called Spillover, repackaged for an America that is suddenly all ears. The stitches from that sudden surgery show clearly in the book, which is rather frustratingly organised. It leaps back and forth chronologically.</p> <p>But when he’s detailing the science Quammen manages to sound just like the patient high school science teacher we all want to hear from in times of turmoil. He carefully takes us through newer outbreaks and scientific discovery about the virus. His explanations of biological terms like “zoonosis” and “reservoir species” have a wonderful directness and clarity to them.</p> <p>Along the way, while making some nice gestures towards The Hot Zone, he also carefully debunks much of it. Of Preston’s description of Ebola’s symptoms, for example, Quammen politely demurs, “It’s my duty to advise you that you need not take these descriptions quite literally.” He also likes to joke about some of the more dire protocols for disease protection:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Advisory: If your husband catches an Ebolavirus, give him food and water and love and maybe prayers but keep your distance, wait patiently, hope for the best – and, if he dies, don’t clean out his bowels by hand.</p> </blockquote> <p>Quammen is not, however, totally sanguine about the slow creep of the disease. His slower pace and measured tone is not cover for a state of denial. He explains that the disease is unpredictable in part because it is zoonotic, because it mutates quickly and can hide from us for ages and then emerge, as it has this year, seemingly from nowhere. That quality of creeping out at us from the dark is part of what gives Ebola its terrifying quality; it’s good to know that there is at least one person who, though he might be shaking a little himself, is trying to shine a clear and sober flashlight into the cave.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/28/uk-can-defend-against-ebola-locally <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/30/ebola-what-is-the-real-risk" title="">Ebola is not a serious threat to the UK</a>, but it is one we must be ready for at both national and local level. Earlier this month, hundreds of staff from local services from all over the country, who will be the first to respond in any health or other civil emergency, spent two days working out how to deal with a potential Ebola outbreak.</p> <p>In my own region, Devon and Cornwall, 90 people from our local resilience forum (LRF), including representatives from the emergency services, the NHS, sea ports, airports and local authorities, took part in a planning exercise. It followed a meeting of the central Cobra emergency committee, chaired by health secretary Jeremy Hunt, on which I represent the police.</p> <p>There are 43 LRFs in England and Wales. They cover the same geographical areas as police forces and are designed to bring together all the agencies that would deal with disasters. Our job is to identify the potential risks and put plans in place to respond to them at a local level.</p> <p>In the south-west, where I chair our local forum, the greatest risk we face is flooding and it is our job to be prepared. Dealing with an Ebola outbreak, as with flooding, is about really good co-ordination. Every LRF includes an officer from central government, who provides guidance and advice from the national level and who feeds back local information to ministers, so we can get action from government when it is needed.</p> <p>We plan for many potential risks, including those to public health, such as the recent swine flu outbreak. In the past few months, many LRFs have been gearing up to run planning exercises focused on dealing with swine flu. That’s what we were going to be doing when we met this month, but instead we found ourselves contemplating what we would do in the case of an Ebola outbreak.</p> <p>The police, with expertise in command-and-control systems and in communications, usually chair LRF meetings, but we are not necessarily the lead service during an emergency itself. In the case of a health emergency, such as a potential Ebola outbreak, the lead in our region would be taken by the director of public health, Debra Lapthorne. Her role would include planning for how to screen people – after all some of the early symptoms are not dissimilar to colds and flu – and how to handle the media.</p> <p>The screening process includes plans for monitoring returning military personnel and medical staff. If anyone does contract the disease, it will be very quickly picked up. Anyone who does contract Ebola will be taken to one of the specialist beds we now have available in London and around the country. There are two beds now permanently ready at London’s Royal Free hospital with more available in other hospitals. It is the job of the ambulance service to transport people to these units. Most ambulances are capable of dealing with infectious diseases but some – the specialist hazardous area response teams – are of a higher standard, and if required, the RAF has a plane capable of carrying an infected individual in a “bubble”.</p> <p>It is the job of the LRF to identify who would be at high risk in order to put a monitoring team around them. Their temperature is taken twice a day. The monitoring teams also provide advice and guidance, and monitor people at lower risk. Everyone works together on this. Public Health England (PHE) takes the lead and has a register of all health workers, aid workers and military personnel who are going to west Africa. PHE will debrief people when they return, to assess the risk and put in place a 21-day monitoring process, to ensure individuals are still healthy. Low-risk individuals monitor themselves, but higher-risk people would be screened several times a day.</p> <p>We know Ebola is a serious disease and we have to stop it spreading, but by implementing good precautions and by being prepared, we can control it and manage it. The biggest issue with Ebola is public fear, rather than the reality. There is a much greater risk to the UK from a flu pandemic than from Ebola.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/28/ebola-africa-symptom-failing-economic-system-west-deforestation <p>Like a sleepwalker roused from his dream, the world is slowly waking up to the full nightmare of the Ebola outbreak decimating west Africa. With small numbers of cases turning up in western countries, governments here are belatedly pledging action to fight the disease, which has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/25/ebola-cases-10000-mali-death">already claimed almost 5,000 lives</a>.</p> <p>Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – all countries struggling to recover from wars still fresh in the memory – have buckled under the onslaught of this horrific virus. Inadequate, creaking health services have been no match for a ruthless killer. But while the shocking poverty of these countries provides the fertile ground for the disease to spread, there are bigger issues at play that ought to cause us to think about the macroeconomic conditions that brought us to this point.</p> <p>Ebola – like HIV, anthrax, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/sars">Sars</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/bird-flu">avian flu</a> and other pandemics of recent years – is a zoonotic virus, one that has crossed from animals to humans. It was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/04/ebola-zaire-peter-piot-outbreak">first identified in 1976</a> during near-simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).</p> <p>The strain of Ebola implicated in the current outbreak is thought to have originated from a mutant pathogen found in fruit bats. This is where we see a direct connection with economic development. The conflicts which have done so much damage to the affected countries have also attracted a range of activities – both legal and illicit – including logging and extractive industries like bauxite mining, which have deforested large swathes of the region.</p> <p>This massacre of the natural environment has reduced biodiversity and pushed the remaining fauna into closer contact with humans. So the fruit bats forced out of former rainforest are now seeking food from human settlements – and becoming food themselves, with the disastrous consequences we are now seeing. <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/">According to the World Health Organization (WHO)</a>, it is thought that Ebola is “introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals…”</p> <p>And we already know that the risk doesn’t only come from so-called “bushmeat” – intensive animal husbandry and battery farming can produce the same results, as we have seen with the avian and swine flus of recent years.</p> <p>These diseases not only kill people, they also devastate the productive bases of economies. The World Bank has already estimated that the economic cost of Ebola to the countries of west Africa <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/health/brief/world-bank-group-ebola-fact-sheet">could be as high as $32.6bn (£20.2bn)</a> by the end of 2015. But for fragile economies already teetering on the brink, this represents an incalculable human catastrophe.</p> <p>We have to face up to the fact that as we are making increasing demands on habitats and exploiting animals more intensively for foodstuffs, the risk of zoonotic infections will increase.</p> <p>These outbreaks can become global pandemics very quickly, so there is a case for early intervention. In the case of Ebola, the international community failed to act quickly enough and we are now paying the price.</p> <p>The fact that the global north is only now responding in earnest serves only to highlight the general indifference with which it regards the spread of infectious diseases in Africa. In fact, however, we have a lot to learn from those countries – the DRC, Nigeria and Senegal – which have already succeeded in containing the virus, despite their limited healthcare and sanitary infrastructure.</p> <p>But now should also be a time for some soul-searching. If we choose to acknowledge it, we can discern that Ebola and diseases like it are the product of a global economic model that is destructive and exploitative to the point of creating serious risks to human health – from possible pandemics, but also the ongoing effects of man-made climate change.</p> <p>At University College London, our new Institute for Global Prosperity is taking a “whole university” approach to examining the world’s greatest challenges and thinking about ways we could do things differently. It’s about recognising the context of global interconnectivity and thinking hard about the impact on prosperity for all of us.</p> <p>For example, companies that are involved in natural resources extraction need to think about the long-term impact of activities like timber logging and mining because they cut down the buffer between humans and animals and thereby increase the chance of pathogenic mutation. So as well as direct harm to the natural environment, there’s a potential knock-on effect on human societies and economies.</p> <p>We need to think of alternative development paths and this means a reassessment of the notion of profit. Suppose our business models were not just calculated in monetary terms, or return to shareholders, but were based on what the business contributed to the creation of social value and the long-term sustainability of the environment, on which the future of both business and communities depend? There needs to be recognition of the consequences of not doing so, which are very deleterious not just for individual countries but potentially for others around the world.</p> <p>That doesn’t absolve governments of their responsibilities for setting the regulatory framework and enforcement regimes. But as the engine of the global economy, businesses have a vital role to play in creating social and environmental value.</p> <p><em>Professor Henrietta Moore is director of <a href="http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/prosperity">UCL Institute for Global Prosperity</a></em></p> <p><strong>Read more stories like this: </strong></p> <ul> <li> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/26/8-innovations-economic-system-capitalism">8 institutional innovations that could update the economic system</a> </li> <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/22/lord-stern-global-warming-billions-climate-refugees">Lord Stern: global warming may create billions of climate refugees</a> </li> <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/15/twitter-list-10-top-tweeters-on-economic-transformation">Twitter list: 10 top tweeters on economic transformation </a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/27/hiv-lessons-ebola-quarantine-new-york <p>The HIV crisis of the 1980s made it unquestionably clear that fear and stigma should have no role in determining the government’s response to any disease. Sadly, after the first few cases of Ebola in the United States, it’s become evident that few of our politicians learned this lesson from history.</p> <p>HIV activists know all too well the fatal consequences of a public health response founded on fear and stigma instead of scientific evidence. In the 1980s, as reports of Aids cases began coming in from across the United States and the death toll skyrocketed, the political response in America ranged from outright negligence to kneejerk, fear-based policies. Even as evidence mounted that HIV could not be transmitted by casual contact, politicians called for unnecessary quarantines and repeated myths that HIV could be spread by merely sharing a water glass. The lack of evidence-based policies significantly increased the epidemic’s death toll – and led to immeasurable suffering for all of those people impacted by the virus. </p> <p>But as the first case of Ebola was reported last Thursday in New York City, the scene unfolded much differently. Taking care to avoid stoking unnecessary fear, Governor Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio, and city health commissioner Dr Mary Travis Bassett <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/24/new-york-ebola-patient-officials-calm">calmly informed the public</a> about the situation and described the public health plan being implemented to reduce the risk of secondary transmission. Unlike the early response to Aids – which frequently lacked any kind of scientific foundation – the response of our state and city officials to Ebola was judiciously informed by the nearly four decades of scientific data we possess on Ebola epidemiology.</p> <p>However, in a complete reversal of course less than 24 hours later, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Cuomo <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/24/ebola-quarantine-new-york-new-jersey-west-africa">announced</a> in a separate news conference that all persons who reported contact with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia – including health care workers, who work there and return home following stringent safety protocols– would be involuntarily quarantined for three weeks, regardless of the presence of any symptoms even suggesting Ebola.</p> <p>The justification that Cuomo and Christie gave for their policy shift – that involuntary quarantine of patients displaying no symptoms is necessary to reduce the risk of secondary transmission – goes against everything that scientists know about the way in which Ebola is transmitted. Since the first recorded outbreak of Ebola in 1976,<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/09/ebola-highly-contagious-virus-myths-outbreak-epidemic">there has been no evidence</a> suggesting that patients with the virus can infect other people until they display symptoms of the disease.</p> <p>The quarantine policy is further unjustified considering that, on 10 October 2014 – a week before Cuomo and Christie enacted their separate policy – the Centers for Disease Control <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/images/JointAirportScreeningFactSheet.pdf">announced</a> a far more evidence based policy whereby <em>all </em>travelers from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia coming into the United States would be actively monitored every day by public health workers for symptoms of the disease, while still allowing those persons contact with friends and family and their freedom of movement.</p> <p>While Cuomo and Christie’s plan offers little in terms of public health benefit, it does offer the potential to disastrously disrupt the United States’ response to the rapidly worsening epidemic in West Africa – where more than 10,000 cases of Ebola and and 4,500 deaths have already been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/25/ebola-10000-world-health-organisation-who-figures">reported</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6303a1.htm?s_cid=su6303a1_w">Modeling from the CDC</a> shows that we need to have more than 70% of sick patients properly isolated and in medical care in order to bring the epidemic under control. Yet a day before Christie and Cuomo announced their quarantine policy, <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/137091/1/roadmapsitrep22Oct2014_eng.pdf?ua=1">the World Health Organization stated</a> that it still lacked staffing for 40% of the treatment units needed to accomplish this goal.</p> <p>The actions taken by Christie and Cuomo will greatly impair the world’s ability to close that gap. The stigma they are manufacturing has the potential to chill efforts to recruit medical professionals to help fight the Ebola outbreak and create even worse outcomes for Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. Worse outcomes there mean greater risks here, and the rest of the world.</p> <p>These policies cause the same kind of fear, stigma and indifference that characterized the early response to HIV pandemic – and which, in part, resulted in a public health crisis that devolved into the third deadliest pandemic in human history.</p> <p>With the potential costs so high, we cannot afford to make the same political mistakes with Ebola that we did with HIV. If we have any hope to save the lives of countless Africans and avoid unnecessary suffering for those who dare to try to help them, we need to immediately reverse the foolish quarantines that perpetuate a plague of fear on American soil. </p> <p>For decades now HIV activists have vowed that this sort of public health insanity would never happen again. It appears that we will have to fight once more, as political leaders choose fear over fact and fail us by refusing to listen to medical experts.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/27/nurse-ebola-quarantine-released-newark <p>A nurse <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/26/ebola-christie-quarantine-west-africa-monitor-symptoms-airport">detained after returning to the US from treating Ebola patients</a> in west Africa is to be released, as the governors of New York and New Jersey scaled back plans to forcibly quarantine medics who came into contact with the virus.</p> <p>Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey said on Monday that Kaci Hickox, a nurse who threatened to sue after being held in a tent at a Newark hospital since her arrival from Sierra Leone on Friday, despite testing negative for Ebola, was being discharged.</p> <p>Christie’s office said in a statement that Hickox would be transported to her home state. “Health officials in Maine have been notified of her arrangements and will make a determination under their own laws on her treatment when she arrives,” it said.<br /> <br /> The release of Hickox, a nurse for Doctors Without Borders, known internationally as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), followed pressure from the White House, sharp criticism of her treatment from mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, and the nurse’s decision to recruit Norman Siegel, a renowned civil rights lawyer.</p> <p>The retreat by Christie, a Republican widely viewed as a potential presidential candidate in 2016, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/24/ebola-quarantine-new-york-new-jersey-west-africa">came after he initially insisted</a> that the quarantine was necessary to protect the people of New Jersey. He continued to claim that Hickox was “obviously ill” after she had tested negative for Ebola.</p> <p>De Blasio, who was not consulted on the state quarantine plans, said on Sunday that Hickox was a “hero” who had been mistreated by New Jersey. “What happened to her was inappropriate,” he said, during remarks at Bellevue hospital in Manhattan. </p> <p>The 33-year-old nurse was confined to a tent with no shower at University Hospital in Newark. In several statements to the media over the weekend, she said that she was being made to feel like a criminal. Shortly before her release was announced, she told ABC News that she hoped “this nightmare of mine and the fight that I’ve undertaken is not in vain”.</p> <p>De Blasio also criticised “misstatements” made about Dr Craig Spencer, who also worked for MSF, and who was diagnosed as suffering from Ebola last week. “This is an incredibly noble human being,” said De Blasio. Cuomo on Friday incorrectly stated that Spencer, 33, “didn’t follow the guidelines for the quarantine”, when he was monitoring his own conditions as set out in guidelines from MSF and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> <p>De Blasio urged residents to respect all medics, saying that he had received reports of Bellevue nurses being refused service at food outlets and having their children treated differently since the Ebola patient began treatment at the hospital last week.</p> <p>At the weekend, the White House made clear its concerns about the hurried reaction to the Spencer case. A White House official said that Christie and Cuomo had been warned the “unintended consequences” of mandatory quarantines, and that the Obama administration objected to the hurried introduction of “policies not grounded in science”.</p> <p>Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the United Nations, on Sunday became the highest-ranked administration official to officially comment, telling NBC: “We need to make sure [returning healthcare workers] are treated like conquering heroes and not in any other way.”</p> <p>Virginia on Monday announced increased monitoring of passengers arriving from west Africa through Dulles international airport outside Washington, but did not impose a mandatory quarantine.</p> <p>Travellers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the three west African countries worst affected by Ebola, will be required to sign an agreement to monitor their temperature and stay at home for the duration of the disease’s 21-day incubation period.</p> <p>Adherence to these procedures will be monitored daily by Virginia health officials, commissioner of health Dr Marissa Levine told reporters in a conference call on Monday, but in “low-risk cases” the daily contact will be via phone calls.</p> <p>Dulles is one of five airports estimated to handle over 90% of travellers arriving from west Africa, and although there are no direct flights, Levine said between two and 15 people a day arrive though Dulles from affected countries.</p> <p>From Monday, the CDC will require any traveler returning from the three affected west African countries to report their temperatures to their local health authorities. </p> <p>They will be required to report every day for the 21 days following their departure from west Africa, the maximum estimated incubation period for Ebola. They will also be required to tell officials where they will be staying in the three weeks after they arrive and to hand over a list of relatives.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/26/ebola-vaccine-race-is-on <p>In 1959 the French microbiologist René Dubos gazed into his crystal ball and found reasons to be concerned. In his lifetime Dubos had witnessed the steady decline of diseases such as diphtheria, tuberculosis and polio, but rather than giving him confidence these medical successes filled him with foreboding. Though vaccines and therapeutic drugs had neutralised many of the threats of the past, he warned that humans could not escape the microbes that transmitted infectious diseases, because they were part of the environment and our ecology.</p> <p>Complete freedom from infectious disease was a mirage, he warned. “At some unpredictable time and in some unforeseeable manner nature will strike back.”</p> <p>The Ebola outbreak is arguably just such a riposte, shattering western dreams of medical utopias. While the reservoir (the long-term host) of the virus has yet to be identified (fruit bats and apes are the leading contenders) there is little doubt that Ebola is the greatest threat to the world’s health and security since HIV/Aids or that the fault lies with man and his insatiable demand for the world’s natural resources – a demand that puts an intolerable strain on ecosystems and the parasites that inhabit them.</p> <p>No one knows for certain where or when the decisive “spill- over” event occurred – one theory is that “patient zero” was a two-year-old boy from Guéckédou in south-eastern Guinea who contracted Ebola from contaminated bush meat in December; another, is that Ebola is continuously emerging and that there were several simultaneous spill-overs. Whatever the case, however, the situation in west Africa is dire and getting worse by the hour – a humanitarian disaster, according to Oxfam – which is why infectious-disease experts are increasingly looking to a vaccine as our next best hope.</p> <p>“A vaccine is critical because the truth is we just don’t know what is going to happen,” says Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust and a veteran of several epidemic scares, including the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/sars">2003 Sars outbreak </a>and the wave of bird flu that swept south-east Asia in 2005. “I’m very much hoping that we will be able to bring this epidemic under control using classic public health containment measures, but if those measures fail then we need an alternative strategy.”</p> <p>That strategy is now the responsibility of researchers at laboratories in Britain, Canada, the US and Mali, where scientists are in a race to develop vaccines that could be shipped to west Africa as early as December, with more doses to follow next year if trials demonstrate that they are safe and effective. The frontrunner is a vaccine known as ChAd3, developed jointly by the biowarfare arm of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Okairos, a Swiss-Italian biotechnology company that is now part of the pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline. Trials of different versions of the ChAd3 vaccine are under way at the Jenner Institute in Oxford, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical centre in Bethesda, Maryland, and the centre for vaccine development in Mali. About 140 volunteers are being enrolled across the three trial sites between now and the end of the year.</p>  <figure class="element element-image element--supporting" data-media-id="0f5ec4944eb9ff8921ecf620d8e07648a10e9a9c"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/23/1414066401777/785ea6f0-9ff0-4a1d-b18a-32a10192dc05-460x276.jpeg" alt="People wear masks in Hong Kong during the Sars outbreak in 2003." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">People wear masks in Hong Kong during the Sars outbreak in 2003.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition, a fortnight ago the Canadian government announced that it and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the US would trial yet another experimental vaccine, known as VSV-EBOV. Such is the concern about Ebola, however, that even before that trial began Canada announced that it was donating 800 vials of its vaccine to the World Health Organisation in Geneva (this is a vaccine which, so far, has only been tested on non-human primates). Last week Johnson &amp; Johnson also announced it was investing $200m in developing a two-step Ebola vaccine together with Denmark-based biotechnology company Bavarian Nordic. Like GSK’s vaccine, the vaccine has performed well in animal trials. The difference is it involves taking two shots, the first to prime the immune system and the second to boost it. J&amp;J is planning to begin human trials in January and says it could have 250,000 doses available by May. Separately, the WHO says it hopes to make a serum vaccine using antibodies from the blood of Ebola survivors available in Liberia within two weeks.</p> <p>Meanwhile, China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences has donated several thousand doses of an experimental drug, JK-05, for emergency use by Chinese aid workers in west Africa, while Peter Horby, a tropical disease specialist from Oxford, is in the process of testing several other promising drug candidates, including ZMapp, the drug used to successfully treat two American missionaries and the British nurse <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/09/william-pooley-ebola-sierra-leone-outbreak-epidemic">Will Pooley</a>, at clinics in Liberia operated by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).</p> <p>Whether these efforts will bear fruit quickly enough to halt the tide of human infections depends on two factors: how quickly the world can ramp up its response to the epidemic and what the virus decides to do next. While the first is in our hands, the second is not. Ebola, like all viruses, is constantly mutating and could theoretically become even more virulent or, conversely, evolve so as to become less virulent and more widely infective. It is this second scenario that keeps disease experts awake at night.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2014/oct/ebola/#map" data-alt="Graphic showing the spread of Ebola"> <a href="http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2014/oct/ebola/#map">Graphic showing the spread of Ebola</a> </figure>  <p>“This virus is now in thousands of individuals and every time that happens it gives a virus the ability to change and adapt to human beings,” says Farrar. “Then you don’t know where the virus is going to go but you run the risk that it will become a natural endemic human infection.”</p> <p>In other words, Ebola could become more like HIV, a virus that, because it does not provoke obvious symptoms, at least in the early stages of infection, to date has succeeded in infecting 75 million people worldwide.</p> <p>The problem is that what began as a highly containable outbreak in Guinea last December has now changed into a conflagration that is threatening to spill over from Liberia and Sierra Leone, the two worst affected countries, to Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau, with Mali confirming its first case last week (though, thankfully, both Senegal and Nigeria recently declared they were free of infection). Meanwhile, as the isolation of in New York last week of a MSF doctor who had recently returned from Guinea shows, there is an ongoing risk of health workers introducing Ebola to countries outside Africa.</p> <p>And the longer Ebola is allowed to burn in Africa, the greater the chances that it will set off bush fires in other parts of the world. It couldn’t happen here, we are told, because our health systems are too robust. But as the World Health Organisation charts the epidemic’s relentless upward curve (10,000 cases a week by the end of October is the current prediction; cumulatively, perhaps as many as 1.4m cases by January) and stories emerge of elementary errors by hospitals and health authorities that should know better, many experts are beginning to worry that the worst could happen.</p> <p>In many ways, Ebola is no different from any other infectious disease, such as influenza, that originally began life in animals. The difference is that whereas influenza is now well-established in human populations, meaning that most people will have some immunity to it, Ebola outbreaks are relatively rare.</p>  <figure class="element element-image element--supporting" data-media-id="a9f73e8d6769e87a1d71e6b1fa2535f7d21c08ee"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/23/1414066555711/36bbfbe3-7bcc-4310-bf6c-61db87200b8f-280x420.jpeg" alt="The Ebola virus has a remarkable ability to transform itself and escape detection." width="280" height="420" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">The Ebola virus has a remarkable ability to transform itself and escape detection.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Cultura RM / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first documented outbreak occurred in the Yambuku district of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in the summer of 1976. It was there that Peter Piot, currently director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine but then a young infectious disease expert, first encountered the virus and together with colleagues decided to name it after a river that flowed through the district. That same year at around the same time there was another outbreak in Sudan of a closely related strain, dubbed Sudan Ebolavirus. In both cases the spread of infection was amplified by contaminated needles and syringes and many medical personnel were infected.</p> <p>Since then three further strains have been identified: Reston virus, Taï Forest virus (formerly known as Côte d’Ivoire Ebolavirus) and Bundibugyo virus. However, the Zaire and Sudan strains are the two commonest cause of human infections, with the Zaire strain having the highest lethality (up to 90% in some outbreaks). Curiously, Reston is the only Ebola virus not currently known to be pathogenic in humans, although it is highly lethal to non-human primates. The reasons why it has not caused disease among humans are not yet understood.</p> <p>Ebola is also closely related to Marburg, another filovirus (the family of “filament” viruses) that was first identified in 1967 when it infected laboratory workers in Germany and Yugoslavia handling imported primates from Uganda. Like Ebola, Marburg is extremely virulent, causing a haemorrhagic fever that frequently proves deadly. It is for this reason that both Ebola and Marburg have attracted attention as possible biowarfare agents and that popular writers such as Richard Preston, author of the bestselling nonfiction thriller <em>The Hot Zone</em>, have been drawn to the subject, describing the viruses in lurid and often exaggerated terms.</p> <p>One reason for the fear surrounding Ebola is that no one knows where the virus goes between outbreaks. Primates have long been known to harbour Marburg. Both it and the Ebola virus have also been found in three species of fruit bat in and around Gabon. As bats constitute a quarter of all the mammals on the planet, there is a good chance they are the main reservoir of the virus and that the consumption of bats, or chimps infected by bats, could be the main route towards human infections, but to date no one has been able to prove it.</p> <p>The good news is that humans seem to represent an end point for the virus, with evidence of only “stuttering” chains of transmission during outbreaks and no evidence that humans can reintroduce the virus back into another animal (however, there is evidence that fruit bats may have introduced the Reston strain of the virus into Asian pig farms). The bad news is that Ebola has multiple strategies for evading our immune system.</p> <p>Dr Erica Ollmann Saphire understands Ebola as well as any scientist alive. A structural biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, Saphire has been working with laboratories around the world to map the structure of the Ebola virus in an effort to pinpoint its weak spots and identify antibody targets for drugs and vaccines.</p> <p>In popular discourses Ebola, which can provoke internal haemorrhaging and, in some cases, bloody effusions, has been dubbed the “Hammer horror virus” and compared to the creature in <em>Alien</em>, but according to Saphire the metaphor that best describes Ebola at a molecular level is that of a “Transformer”.</p> <p>Like the children’s toy that can be unfolded and refolded to turn it from a truck to a robot and back again, Ebola is able to change shape seemingly at will. According to Saphire, this facility, which is controlled by a single protein known as VP40, defies a central dogma of molecular biology: namely, that gene sequence dictates function. Although Ebola has seven genes, by rearranging its protein structure the virus is able to carry out far more than seven functions.</p> <p>“We don’t typically expect molecules in biology to do that,” says Saphire. “We expect proteins to have one particular form – just the robot. But Ebola can unfold from a robot to a truck. It can walk and talk and shoot, and other times it can carry a lot of cargo and drive at high speeds along the highway.”</p> <p>This has important implications for drug design because it means that you may need to devise therapies that are effective against both the robot and truck forms of Ebola in order to be sure of neutralising the virus.</p> <p>That is not the end of Ebola’s tricks, however. Ebola is also a master at evading our immune system. It does this by employing two other proteins, known as VP35 and VP24. The first enables the long filament-like strands of virus to form a spiral shape that Saphire likens to an invisibility cloak. Meanwhile, VP24 blocks the release of interferon, the protein that signals the presence of a foreign pathogen and tells the body to ramp up its immune response.</p> <p>Another factor in Ebola’s favour is that half its mass is carbohydrate, the compound that provides energy for human cells, so again our immune system doesn’t register the virus as foreign. In addition, the glycoproteins the virus uses to bind to receptor sites on host cells are arranged along the main trunk of the virus, where they lie concealed beneath leafy side branches. It is only when the virus is sucked into the interior of the cell that it severs these branches by hijacking enzymes within the cell and reveals its true nature. But by then it is too late. Now the virus can use the cell’s machinery to produce millions of copies of itself.</p> <p>From then on it’s a race between the virus and our immune system. Unlike HIV, which only infects two types of immune cells, Ebola first infects the leucocytes, the white cells that patrol the blood and lymph system. Then it attacks nearly every other type of cell. This process typically takes between two and 21 days, with death occurring, on average, six to 16 days after the onset of the illness.</p> <p>The first symptoms are fever, headache and fatigue. But as the virus begins to overwhelm more cells, the cells burst, prompting a chemical release that leads to inflammation and toxic shock. As the viral load increases, patients suffer stomach pains, bloody diarrhoea, severe sore throats, jaundice and vomiting. Eventually the viral load becomes too great, prompting the immune system to go into overdrive and launch an all-out attack known as a cytokine storm, which causes even more damage. The final stage comes when cells infected with the virus attach themselves to the inside of vessels and arteries, weakening them to the point where they begin to leak fluids, leading to a dramatic fall in blood pressure and multiple organ shutdown. In half of cases, the result is uncontrollable haemorrhaging. In the most extreme cases of all these fluids may seep from the nose and mouth and it may appear as if victims are weeping “tears of blood”.</p> <p>For those who have witnessed someone in the death throes of Ebola at close quarters it is an unforgettable sight. One moment, victims are dazed and expressionless. The next they are doubled up in pain and bringing up haemorrhagic discharges from their stomachs – a substance known as “black vomit”. The nearest historical equivalent are the 18th-century outbreaks of yellow fever, a disease that also produces a dark viscous vomit, or the cholera epidemics of the 19th century. Then, as in Freetown and Monrovia today, people collapsed on the streets of London, Liverpool and New York, expiring in pools of fetid fluids as they were shunned by passers-by.</p> <p>It is in the hope of saving Africans from further pain that volunteers are now being enrolled in trials. The most advanced is the trial at the Jenner Institute, which uses ChAd3 (chimp adenovirus type 3, a chimpanzee “cold” virus) as a vector (or agent) to deliver a small segment of genetic material from the Zaire strain of the virus. This is the strain behind the current outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, but unlike the circulating strain the genetic material in the vaccine has been neutralised and the virus does not replicate, so the vaccinated individual cannot become infected with Ebola. Instead, the idea is that the Ebola gene will prompt the cells of the vaccine recipient to manufacture a single protein on the surface of the Ebola virus and that this will induce an immune response.</p> <p>Using the same principle, scientists at the NIH facilities in Bethesda and Mali are trialling a vaccine using genetic material from both the Zaire and Sudan strains of Ebola, while the Canadians are using another animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to deliver genetic material from Ebola to recipients’ cells.</p> <p>The GlaxoSmithKline vaccine has already performed well in animal trials, providing macaque monkeys with 100% protection against Ebola for up to 10 months. But our immune system is very different from that of macaques and, to date, no vector-based vaccine has been licensed for any disease in humans. That is why scientists are proceeding with caution and testing the vaccine in different concentrations in order to ascertain the lowest dose that will elicit an immune response.</p> <p>“The big question is, will the immune responses that we generate with the vaccine be strong enough?” says Professor Adrian Hill, the director of the Jenner Institute. “That’s always a question with new vaccines.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image element--supporting" data-media-id="81d5767a510ac8cdf2aee02b71278c27ef416dce"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/23/1414066845282/7c05769e-f9da-4d81-b0e9-04c979afc7c0-280x420.jpeg" alt="Nick Owen of MSF, who is a guinea pig in trials of the ChAd3 vaccine for Ebola." width="280" height="420" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Nick Owen of MSF, who is a guinea pig in trials of the ChAd3 vaccine for Ebola.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a question to which Nick Owen, who works as an editorial and social media co-ordinator at MSF’s London office, is keen to know the answer. Earlier this month he became one of the first volunteers to receive the vaccine. He felt a bit “flu-ey” the day after the injection, but otherwise the only discomfort is giving blood once a month so that his antibody levels can be measured.</p> <p>“It is odd to think I have a small bit of one of the world’s deadliest viruses coursing through my veins but sitting here in the office, hearing what my colleagues in west Africa were going through, I thought it was the least I could do,” says Owen. “To date 13 of my colleagues have died from the virus after contracting it in their communities. All I’m doing is giving a pint of blood over six months.”</p> <p>Ruth Atkins, an NHS communications manager and former nurse from Oxford, is similarly phlegmatic about her contribution. “I’ve had people say to me I’m a heroine for volunteering to be a guinea pig, but I don’t feel that way at all. I’m just playing my part. The nurses and doctors in Sierra Leone are the real heroes. That’s where the attention should be.”</p> <p>In theory, if the phase one safety trial goes well, then GSK could be in a position to launch the final stage of the tests early next year. What the world can’t afford, says the Wellcome Trust’s Farrar, is to be in a position where the vaccine is shown to be safe and effective but where we have to wait another three to six months to produce it. It is for this reason that the trust has put up £2.8m to fund the production of additional doses of GSK’s vaccine and that Farrar is asking for the usual ethical considerations to be waived.To persuade drug firms to make Ebola vaccines a priority the European Commission is also talking about setting up a €200m fund to offset manufacturers’ research costs. In theory GSK and firms like Johnson &amp; Johnson, could make substantial profits by selling their vaccines to national governments to be stockpiled ahead of an outbreak, as occurred in the run-up to the 2009 swine flu pandemic. In the case of less developed countries the purchase of Eblola vaccines would most likely be subsidised by the UN. However, there is a chance that the next outbreak of Ebola will be caused by a completely different strain of the virus, against which current vaccines could be ineffective.</p> <p>In theory GSK could make as many as 10,000 doses of its vaccine available as early as December – double that if it proves effective in lower doses. Health workers would be the first to receive it, followed in theory by patients in the early stages of Ebola infection who would otherwise face a high risk of death. Farrar points out that when a virologist conducting mouse experiments with the Ebola virus at a lab in Hamburg in 2007 accidentally pricked her finger, she was immediately offered an experimental vaccine and asks: “Why should people in west Africa be treated any differently?”</p> <p>Even if the vaccine cannot be produced in sufficient quantities in time – and last week GSK said it feared its product would be “too late for this epidemic” – Farrar argues that by funding critical research now the world will be in a much better position to respond to Ebola if and when it strikes again.</p> <p>That is a distinct possibility. While in the past Ebola outbreaks have been self-limiting, this outbreak may be different, argues Peter Piot. “From the perspective of a virus, it isn’t desirable for its host, within which the pathogen hopes to multiply, to die so quickly,” he told the <em>Observer</em>. “It would be much better for the virus to allow us to stay alive longer… a mutation that would allow Ebola patients to live a couple of weeks longer is certainly possible.”</p> <p>We must hope that will not happen. Writing half a century ago, Dubos, foreseeing the dangers of rapid technological change and increasing ecological imbalances, urged politicians to “think globally, and act locally”. Although he despaired that his message was going unheeded, Dubos remained an optimist to the end. The trick, he argued, was for scientists to cultivate “an alertness to the unexpected and to be aware that many surprising effects are likely to result from even trivial disturbances of ecological equilibrium”.</p> <p><em>Mark Honigsbaum is a Wellcome Trust Research Fellow at Queen Mary University of London</em></p>

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/26/ebola-fear-shipping-industry-coastguard <p>Ships entering UK waters that have visited ports in west Africa affected by the Ebola virus are being monitored by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which is asking them to provide details of the “health status” on board.</p> <p>There have been claims of an “atmosphere of fear” in the shipping industry, which has led to some seafarers and shipowners refusing to call at those ports in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea at the centre of the medical emergency.</p> <p>If there is any reason to suspect someone on a vessel has the life-threatening disease, a ship in British waters will be required to divert to a port designated by the marine authorities, the MCA said in a circular sent to ports and their pilots.</p> <p>There was also a warning that the information about a vessel of interest affected by Ebola should only be used and shared by individuals who have a genuine operational interest.</p> <p>No seafarers are yet known to have contracted the virus but the website of the London-based insurance business <a href="http://www.steamshipmutual.com/" title="">Steamship Mutual</a> reported in August that Ebola’s “virulence has created an atmosphere of fear. There are examples of crews refusing to enter ports in countries where outbreak of the disease has been reported.”</p> <p>AP Moller-Maersk, the world’s biggest liner operator, has said it is continuing to provide regular services to the affected countries in west Africa but some other companies have transferred vessels, and trade is down in Liberia by 30%.</p> <p>Eva Maria Kops, Maersk Line’s Liberia country manager, said some countries in Asia were refusing to take cargoes from the affected areas. Some African nations have a blanket ban on ships that have called at Monrovia in Liberia, Freetown in Sierra Leone or Conakry in Guinea.</p> <p>Kops said she thought many people were badly overreacting to the outbreak: “I feel safe – absolutely. It is important to state that it is not easy to contract Ebola. There has to be physical contact, while alcohol and chlorine kill the virus.”</p> <p>But she said her company was doing its best to keep crews healthy. Unnecessary contact with port officials was avoided and there were more limited security inspections of the vessels by shoreside authorities.</p> <p>“We have four ships working there and the crews are kept up to date and know how to handle the situation. They wear full suits across the whole body, shoe covers and masks as long as shoreside people are on board. There is no shaking of hands between the two sides as there used to be.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/26/ebola-christie-quarantine-west-africa-monitor-symptoms-airport <p>The first nurse to be isolated under <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/24/ebola-quarantine-new-york-new-jersey-west-africa">New Jersey’s new Ebola rules </a>has slammed governor Chris Christie’s decision to quarantine health workers returning from west Africa, saying he is “not a doctor” and calling the policy “poorly planned” and “not evidence-based” .</p> <p>As state and federal officials scrambled to form a coherent policy on the issue, Kaci Hickox, a volunteer nurse for Doctors Without Borders, who has tested negative for the virus, described her treatment as inhumane and arbitrary. </p> <p>Her remarks came amid a flurry of political activity. The Obama administration said that it was engaged in urgent discussions with the governors of New York, New Jersey and and Illinois over their plans to quarantine all health workers returning from west Africa who have had direct contact with people suffering from Ebola, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/ebola-quarantine.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=LedeSum&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news"> denied suggestions in a New York Times report</a> that they had asked for the restrictions to be lifted.</p> <p>Hickox, who spent a month in Sierra Leone, was quarantined when she arrived at Newark Liberty airport on Friday and on Sunday was still in an isolation unit at University Hospital in Newark. It was unclear whether she would be moved: on Saturday, a spokesperson for the New Jersey department of health told the Guardian: “In general, home will be first choice‎ for quarantining asymptomatic individuals whenever possible.”</p> <p>Hickox first <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/25/obama-facts-not-fear-public-response-ebola-usa">criticised her detention</a> in a piece for the <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/ebola/headlines/20141025-uta-grad-isolated-at-new-jersey-hospital-as-part-of-ebola-quarantine.ece">Dallas Morning News</a> on Saturday. In response, Christie said Hickox was “obviously ill” and added: “I’m sorry if in any way she was inconvenienced, but the inconvenience that could occur from having folks who are symptomatic and ill out and amongst the public is a much, much greater concern of mine.”</p> <p>On Sunday he defended his decision to impose 21-day quarantines even in cases when no symptoms of infection have been shown. Speaking to Fox News, Christie said: “I don’t think when you’re dealing with something as serious as this you can count on voluntary system. This is the government’s job.”</p> <p>The likely candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 added: “I think this is a policy that will become a national policy sooner rather than later.”</p> <p>Later, the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, told a radio station it was “highly unlikely” a doctor coming back from West Africa would not cooperate with a quarantine. “But if you had someone that didn’t want to cooperate you can enforce it legally,” he said. “There’s no doubt about that.”</p> <p>Christie and Cuomo imposed the tougher restrictions on Friday, a day after a New York doctor, Craig Spencer, who had worked with Doctors Without Borders in Guinea, tested positive for Ebola. Spencer, 33, remained in isolation in New York’s Bellevue hospital on Sunday. His condition was reported to have worsened, as expected.</p> <p>Speaking to CNN, Hickox said her treatment had been “inhumane”. She added: “I also want to be treated with compassion and humanity and I don’t feel I’ve been treated that way in the past few days.”</p> <p>She added: “This is so frustrating for me. First of all I don’t think he [Christie] is a doctor, secondly he’s never laid eyes on me and thirdly I have been asymptomatic since I’ve have been here. I feel physically completely strong and emotionally completely exhausted.”</p> <p>Hickox said she wished Christie would be “more careful” in his public statements. “I am not ‘obviously ill’,” she said. “I am completely healthy and with no symptoms. And if he knew anything about Ebola he would know asymptomatic people are not infectious.”</p> <p>Hickox said she had been tested at the hospital, was negative for Ebola and did not have a temperature. She had displayed a high temperature at the airport, but she said: “I truly believe it was an instrument error.”<br /></p> <p>“They were using a forehead scanner and I was obviously distressed and a bit upset and so my cheeks were flushed. I think there has been some evidence that that machine is not very accurate in those kinds of situations.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-99bfc34e-d9ce-4b35-a814-d89885615ce6"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/26/1414343712356/755f7ee3-8c0e-4327-93a0-027df5a6153f-460x276.jpeg" alt="New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left, listens as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">New York governor Andrew Cuomo, left, with New Jersey governor Chris Christie talks at a news conference.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She said she had spoken to New Jersey’s assistant health commissioner, Christopher Rinn, at 6pm on Saturday and had yet to hear a clear plan from him by midday Sunday. “No one has told me how long it will last,” she said. “I don’t know if I am going to be retested and if so why I would be retested. I am completely asymptomatic and the test is not even accurate if you don’t have symptoms.”</p> <p>Hickox said the quarantine rules were “not based on any clear public health evidence and it is not the recommendation of public health and medical experts at this point. We have to be very careful about letting politicians make medical and public health decisions and all of the evidence about Ebola shows that if you are not symptomatic, you are not infectious.”</p> <p>Hickox has retained a well-known civil rights lawyer, Norman Siegel, to challenge the quarantine order and get her out of isolation. Siegel told the New York Times her quarantine “raised substantial civil liberties issues”, and added: “The policy infringes on Kaci Hickox’s constitutional liberty interests. </p> <p>“The policy is overly broad as applied to Ms Hickox and we are preparing to challenge it on her behalf.”</p> <p>Obama administration officials also told the Times they had raised concerns with Christie and Cuomo over the quarantine rules. An administration official called the decision by the governors “uncoordinated, very hurried, an immediate reaction to the New York City case [of Dr Craig Spencer, in isolation at Bellevue hospital] that doesn’t comport with science.” Another official told the Guardian that they had not made a direct request for the states to reveser the rules. </p> <p>On Sunday Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx">National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases</a>, and the Republican congressman Darrel Issa, chairman of the House oversight committee, added their criticisms of the quarantine policy which was also announced in Illinois, home to Chicago O’Hare, the sixth-busiest airport in the world. On Saturday Florida governor Rick Scott ordered twice daily monitoring for anyone returning from west African countries.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="0efe38500155a1f1bff73b5ace3f4ca7d2a39c5e"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/26/1414343683585/88041b42-295c-4258-b762-e59d2cc287e4-460x276.jpeg" alt="Patient Nina Pham is hugged by Dr Anthony Fauci" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Recovered patient Nina Pham is hugged by Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fauci said the new quarantine rules threatened to discourage US health workers from tackling the disease at its source.<br /></p> <p>“The best way to stop this is in Africa,” he told CNN at the start of a tour of the Sunday morning political talk shows. “Health workers needed to be treated in a way that doesn’t discourage them from going to Africa.</p> <p>“Our first goal is to protect the American people but you want to do it in a way that has a scientitfic basis to it. The best way to protect the American people is to stop the epidemic in west Africa.”</p> <p>Sophie Delauney, the US executive director of Doctors Without Borders, the charity for which Hickox and Spencer worked in Africa, also criticised the new quarantine rules, telling NBC: “Quarantine measures or coercive measures against aid workers could give a superfluous sense of security, while the most important [thing] is to tackle the epidemic at its source.”</p> <p>On Fox, Christie said: “Folks that are willing to take that step and willing to volunteer also understand that it’s in their interest and in the public health’s interest to have a 21-day period thereafter if they’ve been directly exposed to people with the virus.”</p> <p>Fauci said scientific evidence showed that people who are not ill, do not have symptoms, and have not come into contact with the bodily fluids of Ebola patients do not transmit the disease. He was backed about the quarantine by Issa.<br /></p> <p>Issa, however, added: “I think governors of both parties are reacting to an absence of leadership, an absence of belief that the federal government really knows what its doing.”</p> <p>Christie is a Republican; Cuomo, himself mentioned as a potential 2016 presidential candidate, and Illinois governor Pat Quinn are Democrats.</p> <p>Issa said: “Science has told us, if we are to take them at their word, that if someone does not have an elevated temperature or the other leader symptoms then we can rely on them not being contagious. If that’s true then immediate isolation of people for 21 days is not the answer. Again, trust matters.”</p> <p>Of President Barack Obama’s handling of the crisis, which has included sending <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/26/obama-samantha-power-west-africa-ebola-mission">UN ambassador Samantha Power</a> to the African nations worst hit and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-czar-white-house-outbreak-ron-klain">the appointment of Ron Klain as an “Ebola czar”</a>, Issa said: “He’s appointed a lawyer. If this was an election problem, I’d be a little less worried.</p> <p>“The fact is I’d rather he had found a four-star general or admiral to co-ordinate these people who have said things that didn’t turn out to be accurate, who have made mistakes and didn’t want to admit them.”</p>

I went to visit Alpha’s grave today. He died alone, frightened, in pain, and bleeding from his eyes. An Ebola victim. An Ebola orphan. </strong></p> <p><strong>One year old. His parents are somewhere in this clearing too. I’ll remember him for ever and I cried for him. Please all of you save a thought for him today. Please.</strong></p> <p>The picture is of a mass grave in Sierra Leone, dug for people who have succumbed to Ebola. It’s stories like this that made me want to take part in the first-ever clinical trial for an Ebola vaccine, which is currently under way at Oxford University’s Jenner Institute.</p> <p>People have said that I must be brave and/or stupid to want to take part in such an experiment, but I don’t quite see the issue. The trial is to test the safety of the vaccine and whether it can produce an immune response, charting the possible side effects and to pinpoint the dosage needed when it is eventually used in the field.</p> <p>I was given the vaccine a week ago. So far, I feel absolutely fine. To be honest, I’ve had flu vaccines that have made me feel worse.</p> <p>A couple of weeks before I was given the vaccine, I had a screening visit with a doctor taking part in the trial. This was to make sure I was fit to take part, and included blood tests and a review of my medical history. I passed.</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, I was back at the university’s centre for clinical vaccinology and tropical medicine, where I was seen by the nurses and given a quick check-up. My temperature and blood pressure were taken — all fine.</p> <p>Then another set of blood samples were taken to establish a baseline for which all of my future blood tests could be measured against: over the next six months I have to return seven times to have my blood tested to see how I’m reacting to the vaccine.</p> <p>The vaccine I’ve been given is called ChAd3, which uses a single benign Ebola virus protein (approximately one-seventh the size of the whole virus) to generate an immune response. It’s carried into my body by a “vector,” in this case a chimpanzee adenovirus – or a common cold. I’m given a virus as it allows the Ebola protein to get inside cells, producing a particular type of immunity.</p> <p>It is, specifically, a chimp virus. That’s because we are often immune to the average common cold, meaning the vaccine might not have a chance to work. I’m essentially tricking my immune system into thinking it has an infection.</p> <p>The nurse brought the vaccine to the appointment room from the freezer, where it was stored at minus 80C. She thawed the vaccine in her hands, drew it into a syringe and, within seconds, it was making its way into my bloodstream from my left upper arm. It was an odd feeling to think that I now had a bit of one of the world’s deadliest diseases coursing through my body.</p> <p>For the first 28 days, I have to keep an electronic diary, recording my temperature and every medical complaint I have, whether it’s a sneezing fit or breaking my ankle – which, thankfully, hasn’t happened.</p> <p>The good news: apart from having slight flu-like symptoms and a mildly sore arm the day after the vaccine, I’ve felt completely fine.</p> <p>It’s a small price to pay and can’t be compared to the sacrifices that healthcare workers in west Africa are making at the moment. Doctors, nurses and other health staff are risking their lives, and many have died attempting to bring some comfort to people infected with this horrendous virus.</p> <p>Many healthcare workers, like my friend Javid [a doctor who also reports for Al Jazeera] – who posted the picture from Sierra Leone while working for MSF – have felt absolutely helpless responding to this outbreak. There is no cure for the disease, and they often feel there is little they can offer patients.</p> <p>I hope that by taking part in this trial I can play a very — and I emphasise the word very — small part in helping to prevent outbreaks of this magnitude from happening again.</p> <p><em>Nick Owen will be a part of the trial for another five months, with three more blood tests to undergo before establishing if his body has reacted well to the vaccine.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/25/ebola-cases-10000-mali-death <p>The global number of cases in the Ebola outbreak has exceeded 10,000, with 4,922 deaths, according to the latest estimates by the World Health Organisation released on Saturday. Three countries with shared borders – Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea – account for all but 10 of the fatalities, with only 27 cases occurring outside the west African epicentre.</p> <p>The UN agency said the number of cases was now 10,141 but that the true figure was much higher, as many families were keeping relatives at home rather than taking them to treatment centres and are burying their dead without official clearance. It said many of the centres were overcrowded.</p> <p>The latest report showed a rise of 400 cases in the last three days in Sierra Leone and Guinea but no change in the number of cases and deaths in the worst- affected country, Liberia.</p> <p>It comes as an analysis of Ebola figures by development consultants the African Governance Initiative (AGI) suggest that even with current efforts to build more hospital facilities in the affected nations, there will be no medical personnel to staff them and there will be a shortage of more than 6,000 hospital beds in Guinea and Sierra Leone by December if the WHO’s worst-case scenario figure of 10,000 new cases a week by the end of the year is reached.</p> <p>AGI chief executive Nick Thompson said: “The international community badly misjudged the impact of the Ebola epidemic in its first few months and is compounding that error by failing to act quickly enough now.” He called for other countries to join Cuba, the US and Britain in sending health workers to the region.</p> <p>On Saturday Barack Obama used his weekly radio address to stress it would be “science not fear” that would tackle Ebola as New Yorkers followed the fate of Craig Spencer, the Médecins sans Frontières doctor who was confirmed as suffering from Ebola six days after he returned from working in Guinea. He had been riding the subways and eating in restaurants before developing an Ebola fever, causing panic and anxiety among Americans.</p> <p>Late on Friday, New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the risk was grave and ordered an automatic 21-day quarantine for anyone returning from the Ebola-affected regions. He criticised the doctor for not following such a procedure voluntarily.</p> <p>But New York’s health commissioner, Dr Mary Bassett, who was said to be furious with the governor, told reporters Spencer had handled himself “really well” and reported to authorities as soon as he had symptoms – the only time when a patient is contagious and can spread the virus through their body fluids.</p> <p>The <em>New York Daily News</em> claimed that an unusually high number of hospital workers have reported in sick since Spencer’s arrival. Despite an all-clear from health officials, the Brooklyn bowling alley Gutters, which Spencer visited hours before he began to feel unwell, was still closed. One couple, expecting an evening of experimental punk music at the club, said they were disappointed.</p> <p>Nurse Kaci Hickox, the first person in New Jersey placed under the 21-day quarantine after she landed at Newark airport on Friday, issued a stinging criticism of her treatment on Saturday after she tested negative for the virus. Hickox, who had been working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, described how she was held in isolation for seven hours and given only a granola bar to eat. She told the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> she was scared for healthcare workers who declare they have been fighting Ebola in west Africa. “I am scared that, like me, they will arrive and see a frenzy of disorganisation, fear and, most frightening, quarantine.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, it has been announced that a million doses of an Ebola vaccine will be produced by the end of 2015. The WHO said that “several hundred thousand” will be produced in the first half of the year.</p> <p>In Australia on Saturday the head of the country’s medical association, the AMA, called on the government to help in Africa. The AMA president, Professor Brian Owler, said that while Britain was sending 750 people to help in Sierra Leone and the US has dispatched more than 3,000 to Liberia, Australia was dragging its feet. “While the government continues to roll out the tired old excuses about why we can’t respond, unfortunately people are going to continue to die,” he said.</p> <p>On Friday, Mali became the latest country to record a death, that of a two-year-old girl. She had travelled with her grandmother hundreds of miles by bus from Guinea via Mali’s capital to the western town of Kayes, where she was diagnosed on Thursday. The WHO said it was treating the situation in Mali as an emergency because the toddler had travelled for 1,000km on buses while showing symptoms of the disease, meaning that she was contagious.</p> <p>Health workers are scrambling to trace hundreds of potential contacts to prevent the virus taking hold in Mali, which had put in place health checkpoints on its borders with Guinea. More than 40 people known to have come into contact with her have been quarantined.</p> <p>Nigeria has recorded eight deaths and there has been one in the US. Senegal and Nigeria have successfully contained outbreaks and been declared free of the disease. This weekend, Ivory Coast was on alert after Guinean authorities informed them that a Guinean health worker had slipped surveillance and headed for the border after a patient had contracted Ebola.</p> <p>Raymonde Goudou Coffie, Ivory Coast’s health minister, said the authorities did not know if the medic had Ebola but he had to be traced.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/25/obama-facts-not-fear-public-response-ebola-usa <p>A nurse who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone has criticized her treatment under a mandatory 21-day quarantine policy <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/24/ebola-quarantine-new-york-new-jersey-west-africa">implemented by three US states</a>, in an article written in a New Jersey hospital where she remained in isolation despite testing negative for the virus on Saturday.</p> <p>Kaci Hickox was placed in quarantine under a policy announced on Friday by New Jersey governor Chris Christie and New York governor Andrew Cuomo, which requires anyone flying into the states after having contact with Ebola sufferers in west Africa to be subject to mandatory isolation for 21 days, thought to be the disease’s maximum incubation period. </p> <p>The mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, told reporters on Saturday that Cuomo had not informed city officials before announcing the new quarantine plans. He declined to offer an opinion on the new rules, but said the city would co-operate with them. The Illinois department of public health imposed similar restrictions.</p> <p>Cuomo and Christie acted after a New York doctor, Craig Spencer, who worked with Ebola patients in Guinea, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/doctor-tests-positive-for-ebola-at-new-york-hospital">tested positive for the disease</a>. He remained in stable condition at Bellevue hospital in New York on Saturday. <br /></p> <p>As officials sought to allay public concerns about the disease, Barack Obama used his presidential address to urge Americans to base their response to domestic Ebola cases on “facts, not fear”.</p> <p>The restrictions imposed on health workers returning from Africa exposes a dilemma for authorities who are keen for American experts to help staunch the disease in Africa but mindful of public concerns at home.</p> <p>In a first-person account <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/ebola/headlines/20141025-uta-grad-isolated-at-new-jersey-hospital-as-part-of-ebola-quarantine.ece">published by the Dallas Morning News</a>, Hickox had sharp criticisms of the additional restrictions. She wrote: “This is not a situation I would wish on anyone, and I am scared for those who will follow me.”<br /></p> <p>Hickox, a volunteer nurse with Doctors Without Borders, was stopped at Newark airport in New Jersey, where she told an immigration official she had travelled from Sierra Leone. She endured several hours of questioning from officials wearing protective coveralls, gloves, masks and face shields. Her temperature was taken, and registered 98F. Then, she said, her temperature was taken a second time.</p> <p>“Four hours after I landed at the airport, an official approached me with a forehead scanner. My cheeks were flushed, I was upset at being held with no explanation. The scanner recorded my temperature as 101,” she wrote.</p> <p>Hickox said she was left alone in a room for another three hours before being taken to the hospital, where her temperature was again recorded. This time it was 98.6F.</p> <p>“I sat alone in the isolation tent and thought of many colleagues who will return home to America and face the same ordeal,” she wrote. “Will they be made to feel like criminals and prisoners?” </p> <p>The New Jersey department of health said Hickox would remain in isolation for the time being. Speaking on Friday, Christie said the state’s health department had determined a quarantine order should be issued; it was not clear on Saturday if it would be issued in New York, where Hickox was traveling to, or New Jersey, where she is in hospital. Hickox is not from the area, Christie said.</p> <p>Civil liberties activists raised concerns about the constitutionality of the new rules, warning they could discourage health workers from volunteering to fight Ebola in Africa. </p> <p>“We understand the importance of protecting the public from an Ebola outbreak,” the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement reported by the New York Times, adding that the mandatory orders for isolation “raise serious constitutional concerns about the state abusing its police powers by detaining people who are exhibiting no Ebola symptoms”.</p> <p>Aid groups have expressed concerns about the effect of the new rules on a region where more doctors and nurses are desperately needed to fight a virus that the World Health Organisation said on Saturday <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/25/ebola-10000-world-health-organisation-who-figures">has now infected more than 10,000 people</a>.

The CDC said in a statement that it “sets the baseline recommended standards, but state and local officials have the prerogative to tighten the regimen as they see fit”.</p> <p>On Friday night Mary Bassett, New York City’s health commissioner, sounded a cautious note. “People who go and volunteer, we have to look at how the new quarantine policy would impact them,” she said on Twitter.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/DrMaryTBassett/statuses/525801196263849984">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>People who go and volunteer, we have to look at how the new quarantine policy would impact them --<a href="https://twitter.com/chrislhayes">@chrislhayes</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/inners?src=hash">#inners</a></p>&mdash; Dr. Mary Bassett (@DrMaryTBassett) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrMaryTBassett/status/525801196263849984">October 25, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Doctors Without Borders, known internationally as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), has warned against a mandatory quarantine on medics returning from Ebola-stricken countries, saying it would be an “excessive measure”.<br /></p> <p>The Obama administration is understood to be considering the effectiveness of imposing a nationwide policy of quarantining health workers returning from west Africa.

He said: “We have to make sure that that flow of medical personnel can continue.”</p> <p>On Saturday, Obama urged calm. “We have to be guided by the science – we have to be guided by the facts, not fear,” the president said in his weekly address to the nation.<br /></p> <p>“Yesterday, New Yorkers showed us the way. They did what they do every day – jumping on buses, riding the subway, crowding into elevators, heading into work, gathering in parks. That spirit – that determination to carry on – is part of what makes New York one of the great cities in the world.</p> <p>“And that’s the spirit all of us can draw upon, as Americans, as we meet this challenge together.”</p> <p>In a conspicuous attempt to allay public fear, on Friday Obama was photographed hugging Nina Pham, the first of two Texas nurses to recover from the disease after treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who contracted Ebola in Liberia and died in Dallas earlier this month. Pham returned home shortly before midnight on Friday, accompanied by her mother and sister.<br /></p> <p>Before the latest Ebola case in New York, the CDC had tightened its monitoring requirements for those arriving in the US from the three west African countries hardest hit by the outbreak. The new monitoring system goes into effect on Monday in six states – New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and Georgia – and will eventually be expanded across the country.<br /></p> <p>The new guidelines will require anyone who flies from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea ­– regardless of whether they are exhibiting symptoms ­– to check in daily with state and local health officials. They will be required to report their temperatures and the any appearance of Ebola-like symptoms, such as severe headaches, fatigue and diarrhoea. They will also be required to consult with health officials if they need, or want, to travel.<br /></p> <p>If an affected individual fails to check in, the CDC said health officials would take immediate action to track the person down and ensure the proper monitoring is carried out. Concern has been raised over the feasibility of such proposed action.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/24/ebola-quarantine-new-york-new-jersey-west-africa <p>Anyone flying into New York and New Jersey after having contact with Ebola sufferers in west Africa will be subjected to a mandatory 21-day quarantine, the governors of the two states announced on Friday, adding that one returning medic had already been detained.</p> <p>Andrew Cuomo of New York and Chris Christie of New Jersey unveiled the joint policy, which goes beyond federal rules set out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as officials indicated the Obama administration was considering a similar rule throughout the US.</p> <p>The governors acted after the hospitalisation in New York of Craig Spencer, a 33-year-old doctor who was infected with the virus while treating patients in Guinea, one of the three west African countries worst affected by Ebola.</p> <p> Aid charities had previously warned that a quarantine rule would deter American doctors from travelling to Africa to help tackle the Ebola crisis. Yet the governors told a press conference in New York on Friday afternoon that they were unsatisfied with a self-monitoring system that had allowed Spencer to travel around crowded parts of the city such as the subway system, a restaurant and a bowling alley, after being infected.</p> <p>Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York, said: “We’re just not comfortable with the concept of voluntary quarantine as an effective public health security measure.” He stressed that the CDC had made clear states were entitled to set tougher rules of their own. </p> <p>Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, said he was prepared to take “whatever steps were necessary to ensure the public health” amid the ongoing risk of Ebola. “New Jersey and New York are going to determine the standards of quarantine, since CDC’s guidance is continually changing,” he said. “We need to set a standard for our two states.”<br /></p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-0a0e8508-38a8-4a68-9c9d-679adff8208d"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414190283364/11361240-0adc-460c-b674-7496884ef90b-460x276.jpeg" alt="Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie speak about the latest Ebola measures on Friday." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie speak about the latest Ebola measures on Friday.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The quarantine rule is expected to apply to anyone, including healthcare workers, who came into contact with people infected with Ebola in Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone. All travellers entering the two states through Newark and JFK international airports after being in the countries suffering from Ebola outbreaks will have their health monitored by state authorities.</p> <p>Christie said that a woman not showing any symptoms of an Ebola infection was quarantined at Newark airport earlier on Friday. Christie said that the woman was a healthcare worker who had been treating patients with Ebola and had travelled to the US from Sierra Leone. She was said to have been heading for New York via the New Jersey airport.</p> <p>Asked whether authorities held concerns about the woman’s health, Christie said: “None that I’m currently aware of.” Asked where exactly inside the airport the woman was being held, the governor told reporters that he did not know, adding: “Not in the United lounge”.</p> <p>The announcement by Cuomo and Christie appeared to take senior New York City officials, who have been overseeing the treatment of Spencer, by surprise. The mayor of New York, Bill De Blasio, told a press conference earlier on Friday that American medical professionals helping to tackle the outbreak in west Africa “are the people who will end this crisis”. He said: “We have to make sure that that flow of medical personnel can continue.”</p> <p>Asked only a few hours before the state quarantine was announced whether such a policy was necessary, De Blasio said: “I think at this point the pieces we have put in play are the right ones”.</p> <p>Doctors Without Borders, which Spencer had been working for in Guinea, said earlier on Friday that a quarantine on medics returning from Ebola-stricken countries would be an “excessive measure”. A spokesman for the organisation, known internationally as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), did not immediately return a request for comment on the New York-New Jersey policy.</p> <p>Amid calls for tougher action from Obama, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, declined during a briefing on Friday to rule out a nationwide quarantine program for returning healthcare workers.</p> <p>Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC, told Reuters that a nationwide quarantine was indeed one option being discussed by administration officials. “There are a number of options being discussed pertaining to the monitoring and mobility of healthcare workers who are returning to the United States from affected countries,” Skinner said.</p> <p>Spencer had finished his work in Guinea on 12 October and left the country on 14 October, flying home to John F Kennedy airport in New York via Europe. He arrived in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> on 17 October.</p> <p><a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/msf-protocols-staff-returning-ebola-affected-countries">Guidelines set out by MSF </a>state that returning medics should stay within four hours of a hospital with isolation facilities, but do not require that they avoid crowds, so long as they do not display symptoms. </p> <p>“As long as a returned staff member does not experience any symptoms, normal life can proceed,” the organisation says. “Family, friends, and neighbors can be assured that a returned staff person who does not present symptoms is not contagious and does not put them at risk.

On Tuesday, he visited the High Line park where he stopped at the Blue Bottle coffee stand, and ate at the Greenwich Avenue branch of the Meatball Shop restaurant.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="f91c0841a7f8d01d91b7b79b8c151b110c62b367"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414190345220/fd199a59-aca6-4e82-89b9-d91d76d2bd13-460x276.jpeg" alt="The Meatball Shop on Greenwich Avenue." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">The Meatball Shop on Greenwich Avenue.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Wednesday, he took a three-mile jog on Riverside Drive, near his home, rode the subway to the Gutter bowling alley in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn and took an Uber cab home, all before he began to display symptoms, officials said.</p> <p>Spencer began to feel feverish on Thursday between 10am and 11am. He contacted Doctors Without Borders immediately, which in turn contacted the New York department of health. Officials organised for him to be transported to Bellevue hospital in the city, a designated site for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola">Ebola</a> patients, under strictly controlled conditions.</p> <p>Health officials said that Spencer declared a fever of 100.3F (38C), not the 103F originally reported. The mistake in the announcemnet was made because of a transcription error, they said, stressing that the lower-grade fever made it even less likely that New Yorkers would have been at risk from Spencer in the previous few days.</p> <p>Mary Bassett, the city health commissioner, said that Spencer was in a stable condition in an isolation unit at Bellevue, where he was taken in an ambulance my fully protected medical teams on Thursday. Spencer’s fiancee, Morgan Dixon, and two of their friends, are in a 21-day quarantine. They are not permitted to leave the undisclosed location where they are staying and will have their health monitored twice daily. </p> <p>Bassett said Spencer was in a stable condition at Bellevue, where doctors were considering whether to offer any of the experimental treatments that have been tried on other Ebola patients in the US.</p> <p>Meanwhile a privately contracted crew of environmental and hazardous material cleaners arrived at the apartment that Spencer shared with his fiancee.</p> <p>De Blasio urged New Yorkers not to be concerned. “There is no reason for New Yorkers to change their daily routine in any way,” he said, stressing that Ebola is very difficult to contract. “It cannot be transmitted through casual contact, it cannot be transmitted through an airborne fashion,” De Blasio said.</p> <p>Outside Spencer’s apartment in Harlem, the area’s city councilman Mark Levine was on the scene to try to reassure neighbours that they were safe. “There’s a lot of misconception out there, and people are scared understandably,” he said. “But they have to understand that you don’t catch this by walking by someone or sitting next to them on the subway or jogging by them in the park.”</p> <p>Some were unconvinced. “This entire neighbourhood is worried,” said Stan Malone, who said he lived across West 147th Street from Spencer. “People want to know why they haven’t quarantined his entire building yet. Ebola is here in the city and you can bet this won’t be the last case.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/doctor-tests-positive-for-ebola-at-new-york-hospital <p>A physician who recently returned to New York from Ebola-ravaged west Africa has tested positive for the disease, officials announced.</p> <p>Craig Spencer, 33, a doctor who lives in the Harlem neighbourhood of the city, was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/23/doctor-treated-ebola-patients-hospital-new-york">taken to hospital in New York </a>on Thursday after displaying symptoms consistent with those caused by Ebola, including a fever of 100.3F (38C) – lower than the 103F (39.5C) that was initial reported by health officials. </p> <p>A preliminary test on Thursday confirmed that Spencer, who arrived back in New York from Guinea on 17 October, has the virus. Federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has sent a team to New York City to assist city and state officials in the response, will carry out a further test to confirm the result.</p> <p>Officials told a press conference at Bellevue hospital on Thursday that they were monitoring four people with whom Spencer had contact. His fiancée, Morgan Dixon, and two friends had been quarantined, while the fourth person, a taxi driver, was not considered to be at risk.</p> <p>Spencer took several trips on the New York subway in the past week, visited the Gutter bowling alley in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn on Wednesday night and took an Uber cab, all before he began to display symptoms, officials said.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed element--supporting" data-alt="ebola graphic">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1414153303383/Ebola_NY_done.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>He began to feel feverish on Thursday between 10am and 11am. He contacted Doctors Without Borders, the organisation with which he had been working in Africa, which in turn contacted the New York department of health. Officials organised for him to be transported to Bellevue hospital in the city, a designated site for Ebola patients, under strictly controlled conditions. </p> <p>“I know the word Ebola right now can spread fear just by the sound of the word,” said New York state governor Andrew Cuomo at a press conference. “Ebola is not an airborne illness, it is contracted when a person is extremely ill and symptomatic.”<br /></p> <p>Officials urged residents of New York not to panic, and drew a comparison with the response to an outbreak in Dallas, Texas, where the city’s principal hospital bungled its initial contacts with an Ebola patient who later died, Thomas Duncan. </p> <p> “I know it’s a frightening situation, I know when you watched it on the news and it was about Dallas it was frightening; that it’s here in New York is more frightening,” Cuomo said. “New York is a dense place, a lot of people are on top of each other. But the more facts you know, the less frightening the situation is.”</p> <p>Spencer’s apartment in Harlem was cordoned off on Thursday night, and health officials were on the scene, giving out information to residents. His fiancée was being monitored in a separate quarantine ward at Bellevue hospital. A team of epidemiologists - referred to by mayor Bill de Blasio at the press conference as “medical detectives” - were questioning Spencer’s contacts and using information from his Metrocard, which would give details of his subway travel, and credit cards.</p> <p>Doctors Without Borders, known internationally as Médecins Sans Frontières, said Spencer had acted in accordance with its guidelines for returning field workers.</p>  <figure class="element element-image element--supporting" data-media-id="b72af97174bd52f7039c181bf6ee9249256dcd0a"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414160229450/fd0bccfd-66b2-4a56-8c5b-3a1b273fc5c2-460x460.jpeg" alt="Craig Spencer" width="460" height="460" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Dr Craig Spencer, who was diagnosed with Ebola at a New York hospital on Thursday.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: LinkedIn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“A person in New York City, who recently worked with Doctors Without Borders in one of the Ebola-affected countries in west Africa, notified our office this morning to report having developed a fever,” it said in a statement.<br /></p> <p>Uber confirmed that one of its drivers had transported Spencer on Wednesday evening. The CDC and the New York department of health assured the company that its driver was unlikely to catch the disease. “We have communicated this to the driver, and the [New York department of health] medical team met with the driver in person, assuring him that he is not at risk. Our thoughts are with the patient and his loved ones.”</p> <p>Spencer’s public Facebook page, which has since been taken down, showed a photo of him dated 18 September wearing protective gear announcing he was heading to Guinea with Doctors Without Borders. It showed him checking into a location in Brussels on 16 October.</p> <p>His LinkedIn profile identified him as a fellow of international emergency medicine at Columbia University-New York Presbyterian hospital.</p> <p>New York Presbyterian hospital released a statement in which it did not identify Spencer by name but called the patient “a dedicated humanitarian on the staff of NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University medical center who went to an area of medical crisis to help a desperately underserved population”.</p> <p>It said he has not returned to work at the hospital or seen any patients since returning from west Africa, where more than more than 4,500 people have died since the current outbreak began.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-280ad022-cde2-45b5-b759-7fd1c05c2e20"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414116715748/bf188812-5924-4418-893b-236e1fcf1259-460x276.jpeg" alt="Police officers stand outside the home of Craig Spencer, a Doctors Without Borders physician  diagnosed with Ebola patients." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Police officers stand outside the home of Craig Spencer, a Doctors Without Borders physician diagnosed with Ebola patients.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Officials have attempted to reassure New Yorkers that the city and state are safe. City health officials repeated that Ebola is difficult to contract, since people must come into direct contact with body fluids of an infected and symptomatic person.</p> <p>Many fears about the disease have swirled around New York’s status as a transport hub. Airports in the metropolitan area process most of the of the passengers arriving in the US from west Africa every day. John F Kennedy international airport and Newark, New Jersey’s airport are among only five in the US permitted to accept passengers from the worst-affected countries – Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p> <p>Starting on Monday, passengers from these countries will be monitored for 21 days after arriving in the US.<br /></p> <p>As part of the New York governor’s Ebola preparedness plan, two ambulances are regularly stationed at JFK and Newark airports, the city’s transit authority was provided with protective gear and training, and unannounced drills are being conducted at airports, college campuses and in subways. The governor designated eight hospitals in the state to handle Ebola patients, including Bellevue.</p> <p>To ease healthcare workers’ fears about the disease, New York City held an Ebola educational session on Tuesday.</p> <p>Barack Obama had spoken by telephone with both Cuomo and De Blasio about the positive test, the White House said, and discussed the deployment of officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Some CDC officials were already in New York and an additional response team would be there by late Thursday night. </p>
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/24/ebola-new-york-patient-city-never-cowers <p>Outside Craig Spencer’s apartment in Harlem, kids on bicycles pull wheelies, showing off for the ranks of TV news cameras. There must be 40-odd journalists here, eight or nine TV vans, maybe 15 or even 20 cameras pointed at the closed door of the building where New York’s Ebola Patient Zero lives.</p> <p>A crowd has gathered to watch the cameras, which are trained on the door. Spencer is not here, of course – he’s at Bellevue hospital – but there are rumours among the camera crews that specialist team will be arriving soon to sweep the apartment.</p> <p>There are people selling street food. Say one thing for this city: when the apocalypse comes, there will be churros.</p> <p>At a Dunkin’ Donuts a block away, patrons mock the earnestness of the TV reporters. Cashier Lynn Butts wonders if Spencer ever bought coffee here. “I was thinking his face was familiar,” she says.</p> <p>She says she’s scared – a little – by the thought of Ebola arriving in her neighbourhood, but not scared enough to stay home. “New York can deal with it,” she says.</p> <p>Since 9/11, one of the identifying cliches New Yorkers carry around with them, alongside “the city that never sleeps”, is the idea of resilience. This is a city that doesn’t cower.</p> <p>Even so, New York’s fight-or-fight response has not been triggered. After the world watched Texas fumble its response when Thomas Duncan came down with the disease last month, New York isn’t taking any chances.</p> <p>Which is not to say that everyone is unafraid. Stan Malone, who says he lives across West 147th Street from Spencer, claims the whole neighbourhood is worried. “People want to know why they haven’t quarantined his entire building yet. Ebola is here in the city, and you can bet this won’t be the last case,” he says.</p> <p>Malone says he had an aunt, an uncle and two cousins who lived two floors away from Spencer in the same building. They moved to a hotel on Thursday, he says, and want to be tested for the virus today.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="73e8c22766c7c1a040cd7a83ea5449ae2a8ba2fc"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414173695559/ea6f9388-3e6b-4623-bcb9-d1d6ba42e851-460x276.jpeg" alt="New York Ebola" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">The Bellevue hospital where Craig Spencer has been admitted.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Laurentiu Garofeanu/Barcroft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But he seems to be the exception. Maybe it’s a consequence of the confidence radiated by the authorities that the situation is completely under control, or maybe not, but there is no real sense of present danger on the streets. The subways are still full, the streets still busy. People are not panicking.</p> <p>Jose Vasquez also lives across the street from Spencer’s apartment. When asked if he’s worried, he cocks his head to one side and says “Ah,” then grins. “Fifty percent,” he says, smiling and wiggling his flattened palm to symbolize ‘so-so’.</p> <p>“We have to worry a little. It is dangerous,” he says. “People with lots of money, they can get medical care. People with less money …” He says he’s not frightened, though. “Nah. Not too much.”</p> <p>For most New Yorkers, it seems that the city’s first case of Ebola barely even registers.</p> <p>There isn’t much fear on the subway, unless you count the odd person neurotically rubbing their hands with Purell – which you can’t, really, because this city hums with neuroses like that pretty much all of the time. It’s a baseline.</p> <p>You can spot someone wearing a mask in line at the deli, perhaps, but then again that’s not unheard of. There may have been one or two more face masks than usual on the subway this morning – or, then again, there may not; the train conductor on the northbound 1 train isn’t sure. He thinks for a while, and says he has seen one mask, maybe, and that’s about normal. “Ebola isn’t airborne, anyway,” he says with authority.</p> <p>Has he seen people showing signs of worry? He shrugs. “Newspapers,” he says, cryptically and perhaps slightly accusingly.</p> <p>Annie Hang, an administrative assistant living in Brooklyn, stands on the platform of the A-C-E line at West 4th street, waiting for the northbound train. She is listening to her iPod – like many New Yorkers, hermetically sealed in mind, if not in body.</p> <p>Is she worried about taking the train? “More about holding the poles,” she laughs. She always uses hand sanitizer, she says. “I am always mindful of what I am touching now.” She’s not really that worried. “There’s nothing I can do about it. So …” She shrugs.</p> <p>Peter Nicholas lives a few blocks from the bowling alley visited by Spencer on Wednesday night. Asked if he was worried about Ebola now that it had come to New York, Nicholas says no, “but my mom is.” He is waiting at the Bedford Avenue L station in Williamsburg for a train into Manhattan on Friday morning. “I don’t really care,” he says.</p> <p>“This is New York,” says Roy Bell, a singer with an a capella group busking on the R train which follows Broadway north as far as Times Square. “It’s gotta spread a lot before we start to panic.” Strangers on the train nod in agreement.</p> <p>On the northbound 3 train, two tourists chat with a young American guy in a backpack. At 72nd street, the two stand up to leave the train, gathering their luggage and shopping bags. “This is our stop. Nice chatting with you!” one of them says, and then, by way of a sardonic farewell, adds: “Don’t get Ebola!”</p> <p>The kid grins.</p> <p><em>Erin McCann and Jana Kasperkevic contributed reporting.</em></p>

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/texas-nurse-ebola-nina-pham-release-test-negative <p>The first nurse diagnosed with Ebola after treating an infected man at a Dallas hospital was released from hospital on Friday and will meet with President Obama in the White House. </p> <p>Nina Pham told reporters she felt “fortunate and blessed to be standing here today” as she left the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) hospital outside Washington DC.</p> <p>She thanked her health care team in Dallas and at the NIH and singled out fellow Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly, who recovered after becoming infected in Liberia, for donating plasma containing Ebola-fighting antibodies as part of her care.</p> <p>“Although I no longer have Ebola, I know it may be a while before I have my strength back,” Pham, 26, said.</p> <p>Dr Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the NIH, gave Pham a hug and told reporters that five consecutive tests showed no virus left in her blood. </p> <p>“She is cured of Ebola, let’s get that clear,” Fauci said.</p> <p>Pham’s release comes a day after a doctor in New York City who had been treating Ebola patients in west Africa was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/ebola-patient-doctor-tracked-to-new-york-trains-taxis-and-the-high-line">diagnosed with the virus</a>. Dr Craig Spencer is being treated in isolation at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan. </p> <p>The 26-year-old Pham <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-infected-nurse-stable-condition-specialist-maryland-hospital">arrived last week at the NIH Clinical Center</a> in Bethesda, Maryland. She had been flown there from Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where she became infected while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of the virus 8 October.</p> <p>A second Dallas nurse <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/ebola-second-texas-nurse-transferred-atlanta">who became infected</a> after treating Duncan has also been pronounced free of the virus, family members said this week. </p> <p>Amber Vinson, who flew to Ohio and back before she was diagnosed, is being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. </p> <p>“We all know that further treatment will be necessary as Amber continues to regain strength, but these latest developments have truly answered prayers and bring our family one step closer to reuniting with her at home,” said her mother, Debra Berry.</p> <p>Emory said Friday Vinson is “making good progress”.</p> <p>Pham’s dog, held in quarantine in Dallas, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/22/texas-nurses-dog-tests-negative-ebola">has also tested negative for Ebola</a>. City officials said one-year-old Bentley, a king charles spaniel, will continue to be monitored until his 21-day quarantine period ends 1 November. </p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/ebola-cure-treatment-scams-fear-silver-vitamin-money <p>First of all, Steve Barwick wants you to know that Ebola is a government conspiracy.</p> <p>“This current ‘Ebola crisis’ is … a massive psy-ops campaign,” he wrote in an (undated) blogpost on his website, <a href="http://www.thesilveredge.com/">The Silver Edge</a>. “In other words, the threat is largely being manufactured and planted into the minds of the American public, through the federal government/news media axis.”</p> <p>Barwick, to his credit, points out correctly that the likelihood of coming in contact with an Ebola victim is “about zero”. But that doesn’t stop him from quickly moving on to the hard sell.</p> <p>“Back in 2008, the US Department of Defense (DOD), in conjunction with several other federal agencies, quietly conducted clinical research into the use of silver nanoparticles against Ebola and other hemorrhagic fever viruses,” he claims. “And what they found was astonishing. They discovered that silver nanoparticles were highly effective against these deadly viruses, including the Ebola virus.”</p> <p>Of course, silver nanoparticles are not highly effective against Ebola – they are not effective at all. Nor is homeopathic rattesnake venom, or oil extracted from sandalwood or cinnamon bark. Nor is vitamin C, in any way other than being simply part of a healthy diet.</p> <p>But all of the above have been, and are still being sold, both implicitly and explicitly, as preventative measures for Ebola in the US.</p> <p>Whenever there is a crisis, profiteering is rarely far behind. The attorney generals of several states – New York, North Carolina and Florida among them – have issued warnings about scams relating to the disease. “New Yorkers should beware of fundraising solicitations and offers of goods and services related to Ebola,” said New York’s attorney general Eric Schneiderman. “Scammers are shamefully exploiting this moment of heightened concern about public health to defraud good people.”</p> <p>Todd Spinelli, a New Yorker, claims to have made $1.4m from a rebranded version of an ordinary vitamin C supplement. His product, “Ebola-C”, makes no claim to medical powers other than those that might be implicit in the name – but that hasn’t stopped Spinelli selling 45,000 units since having the idea at the beginning of October. </p> <p>Spinelli told the Guardian that he was inspired by an episode of the TV health show Dr Oz, and that he’s planning to sell “Ebola-C shots” as an energy drink. “Obviously there’s people saying ‘You’re trying to make money out of fear,’” he said, “but it’s the same way [vitamin C product] Emergen-C did. It’s not an emergency – it’s just Vitamin C.”</p> <p>Gary Cudy, the national health fraud coordinator at the Food and Drug Administration, says the emergence of scammers is not a surprise. “Every time there’s a new emerging public health risk we see fraudulent products appear overnight,” he told the Guardian.</p> <p>It is his team’s job to surf the internet looking for products that are making fraudulent claims, scouring social media, eBay and e-commerce sites, even YouTube videos. “That’s often where these kinds of products appear first,” Cudy said.</p> <p>There are, as Cudy points out, currently no FDA-approved treatments or vaccines for Ebola, so anything that makes claims of curing it on its packaging is considered an unapproved drug. His first step, when the FDA have identified an offender, is to send a warning letter to the company.</p> <p>They have so far sent three of those during the current outbreak: two to <a href="http://www.youngliving.com/en_US">Young Living</a> and <a href="http://www.doterra.com/#/en">dōTERRA International</a>, companies selling Ebola cures based on “essential oils” derived from things like cinnamon bark, peppermint, sandalwood, eucalyptus and rosemary, and another to <a href="http://www.drrima.net/">Rima Laibow</a>, of an organisation called the Natural Solutions Foundation. That last letter pointed to more than 30 violations in which Laibow directly claims that various types of “nano silver” – also known as colloidal silver – is a direct cure for Ebola.</p> <p>“Colloidal silver is a case where with pseudo-scientific lingo can spin a web,” said Joe Schwarcz, director of the office for science and society at McGill University in Montreal. “They say silver has anti-microbial properties, which is true.” He points out that it is often woven into the fibres of socks to kill bad odors. “But they will lead people down the garden path to tell them it can cure the virus,” he said. “That’s a long way from deodorising socks.”</p> <p>“What drives people is pretty clear: it’s money,” said Schwarcz.“Fear tends to open people’s wallets at the same time that it closes people’s minds. In this case, there’s a lot of fear.” He said that some of the products being packaged as Ebola cures, such as “essential oils”, date back as far as the bubonic plague, and that homeopathy was also rearing its head, selling hyper-diluted rattlesnake venom as a cure.</p> <p>The problem for the FDA is the first amendment of the US constitution. It may be illegal to make claims about colloidal silver’s abilities on its packaging, but it appears as if Laibow is able to work around the FDA if she makes the claims separately from where she sells her wares.</p> <p>And Barwick has clearly got the message too. <a href="http://www.thesilveredge.com/">The Silver Edge </a>has a disclaimer at the bottom of the site which reads “Products distributed by The Silver Edge are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.”</p> <p>And if you call the customer support line, which nobody answers, there is an automated message that simply says: “Please keep in mind that we are not doctors.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/24/children-ebola-liberia-unicef-care-centres <p>Tona, my youngest son, turned two today. I couldn’t be with him on his special day, I couldn’t hold him, play with him or do any of the things dads are supposed to do the day their babies turn two.</p> <p>Instead, I spent the day thousands of miles away in Monrovia, the capital city of Liberia, surrounded by several children who had recently been in direct contact with an Ebola patient.</p> <p>Two children at the centre showed symptoms of Ebola the morning of my visit. I was asked to keep a distance from them to reduce the risks of infection. As a communicator I never imagined how difficult and frustrating this no-touch policy would be in practice. Forget handshaking. No hug. No group photo.</p> <p>Ebola hits these children twice. First, it takes their parents away, then it subjects them to stigma, rejection and even abuse. They do not have the comfort, care and attention a child needs in times of grief. Sometimes their own relatives are too scared to take them back. Fear of contagion is becoming stronger than family ties.</p> <p>In west Africa where I have been living for years, children often run to greet visitors and hold their hands. Here, for the first time in my life, I had to refrain from establishing any physical contact and showing the most natural sign of human compassion. It’s an awful and awkward feeling.<br /></p> <p>When you are two metres away from the person you are talking to, establishing a connection is challenging. But I try. We start by talking about football, our favorite food and games. Shirley, an 11-year-old who arrived seven days ago with her two brothers, aged five and nine, smiles and opens up. “My mother and father died. All this because of Ebola,” she says. “Here we play, eat, take showers and sleep. I want to go home. I don’t know if people still want me where I lived before. I know I have to stay here.”</p> <p>Suddenly, in the course of the conversation, one of the boys, Daniel, feels more confident and gets closer to me. Too close. He must be two or three. I stop talking and subtly take a step back but he notices. My eyes betray the fear I feel: neither the armed rebels in the Central African Republic nor the aftershocks of the earthquake in Haiti scared me as much as this toddler touching me.</p> <p>It takes me a few seconds to compose myself. I work for Unicef, an organisation set up to care for children, and yet I am petrified by a vulnerable child.</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-21/ebola-survivors-become-caregivers-testing-their-immunity.html">immunity to Ebola thought to have been developed by survivors</a> makes them ideal candidates to work with children like Daniel. But they need to be vetted and trained. Plans are now under way to open more interim care centres in the worst affected counties, and 50 survivors in total will be involved in running to these centres.</p> <p>Until recently, with their parents and guardians at Ebola treatment centres, these children couldn’t be reunited with their families and had nowhere to go. It made me sad that I couldn’t hug Daniel, or hold his hand. Fortunately for these children, survivors are able to provide that human connection – a hug, a pat on the back, a reassuring touch that reminds them they are not alone.</p> <p><em>Laurent Duvillier is regional communication specialist for <a href="http://www.unicef.org.uk/">Unicef</a>.

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/oct/24/fatalistic-forecasts-hampering-ebola-efforts-liberia <p>During a recent telephone conversation with my aunt, who lives in Liberia, I could hear trepidation in her voice for the first time. At the same time, though, she remained typically stoic, her faith in God unshakable after surviving two armed insurgencies. “They are saying on the radio that before January [2015] thousands of us will die,” said Auntie Arinah. “This thing is getting very scary. We rebuke those numbers!”</p> <p>I couldn’t help feeling moved by my aunt’s tenacity in the midst of her anxiety. Ebola fatality projections seem to have created an atmosphere of psychological distress in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, nations still recovering from the trauma of conflict.</p> <p>The language of alarm has been conspicuous. Estimated casualty numbers are punctuated with conditional verbs such as “could” and “may”. In August, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced that Ebola-related deaths <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/28/ebola-cases-rise-20000-world-health-organisation-west-africa-death-toll" title="">could exceed 20,000</a> if there were no efforts to contain the disease. The projection seemed so far-fetched at the time that Liberia’s president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201409010984.html" title="">publicly rejected them</a>.</p> <p>Estimates have steadily increased. At a news conference in Geneva last week, the WHO estimated that there could be <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/who-new-ebola-cases-world-health-organisation" title="">10,000 new cases</a> over the next two months. The scariest projection of all, referenced by my aunt, came from the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/" title="">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) last month: between <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/23/ebola-cdc-millions-infected-quarantine-africa-epidemic" title="">550,000 and 1.4 million people may be infected by January</a>.</p> <p>I suspect that these forecasts are partly intended to speed up action, so that aid, medical supplies and health practitioners are deployed to the affected countries as quickly as possible. But there are unintended consequences. As a Liberian who has family, friends and colleagues in the country, fatality forecasts aren’t troubling only because they may come to pass. Announcements of probable deaths are affecting people right now.</p> <p>Isolated incidences of Ebola in Europe and the US have already caused hysteria. Africans across the world have been on the receiving end of xenophobia laced with racist venom more than ever before. Alarmist projections only add fuel to the fire.</p> <p>I’m not denying the threat Ebola poses if it is not contained. Yet I remain convinced that the grim statistics and apocalyptic framing of the outbreak are doing more harm than good.</p> <p>I fear the projections may be causing undue stress to people who need hope – healthcare workers battling the disease in hazmat suits; pregnant women on the verge of giving life; patients in Ebola treatment units who refuse to go gentle into that good night; and policymakers looking for solutions.</p> <p>For the countless individuals whose stories have been anonymised by the threat of Ebola, we must change the narrative around fuzzy, conditional statistics. Flip the script. Focus on the number of people who could survive if the response were faster. If we follow with precision the 70-70-60 formula developed by the WHO – treating 70% of infected patients while burying 70% of those who have died within 60 days – we should be able to predict how many lives will be spared. These numbers must replace the bleak headlines and become a new call to action.</p> <p>In an outbreak of this scale, speed and magnitude, accurate and reliable data is perhaps second only in importance to life-saving medical care. Probable, suspected and confirmed cases must be swiftly disaggregated to minimise over- or under-reporting. The underlying assumption that anyone exhibiting symptoms of Ebola has the virus is faulty and harmful, given the stigma attached to the disease. The recent establishment of mobile laboratories at two clinics in Liberia will enable diagnosis within hours, as opposed to days, so that people can seek appropriate medical attention for Ebola and non-Ebola ailments.</p> <p>The mantra so far – “it may get worse before it gets better” – seems rather defeatist. Instead of heeding fatalistic pronouncements, we need to shift our attention to the 400 people who had Ebola and came through, thanks to quality care in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The 11-year-old boy in Liberia of YouTube fame, <a href="http://www.msf.org/article/liberia-boy-who-tricked-ebola" title="">Mamadee</a>, comes to mind.</p> <p>I’d like to see alarming forecasts of death and doom give way to a more measured and positive approach to the Ebola outbreak. My aunt in Liberia wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/ebola-epidemic-west-africa-lancet-infectious-diseases-liberia <p>The international response to the Ebola epidemic in west Africa is too slow and providing too few beds for the sick to stop the soaring number of cases and deaths, scientists say.</p> <p><a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancetid/article/PIIS1473-3099(14)70995-8/abstract" title="">A paper in the Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal</a> models the response in Montserrado, Liberia, against the spread of the virus and warns that current efforts will not bring the outbreak under control.</p> <p>“Our predictions highlight the rapidly closing window of opportunity for controlling the outbreak, and averting a catastrophic toll of new Ebola cases and deaths in the coming months,” warns Alison Galvani, senior author and professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health.</p> <p>In their paper, she and colleagues say: “Although we might still be within the midst of what will ultimately be viewed as the early phase of the current Ebola virus disease outbreak, the window of opportunity for aversion of calamitous repercussions from an initially delayed and insufficient response is diminishing rapidly. Our predictions suggest that current commitments are grossly inadequate to provide beds for all affected individuals, even only considering near-term growth of the epidemic in Montserrado.”</p> <p>The Yale scientists find that if nothing more is done, there will be more than 170,000 Ebola cases – including those that are unreported – and more than 90,000 deaths by 15 December in Montserrado, a densely populated county containing the capital, Monrovia, and which has one of the highest case rates in Liberia.</p> <p>If there is a rapid growth in provision by 31 October, including 4,800 beds and a five-fold increase in the speed of case detection, and if protective kits are allocated to families forced to nurse patients at home for want of a bed, nearly 98,000 of those cases could be prevented, they say. But if the response is delayed to 15 November, only about 54,000, would be prevented.</p>  <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/22/ebola-virus-how-it-spreads-video"                                data-video-id="2179174"                data-video-name="Ebola virus: how it spreads and what it does to you – video"                data-video-provider="guardian.co.uk"                data-video-poster="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/22/1413965303218/New-ebola-pic-017.jpg"> <video data-media-id="gu-video-450290457" class="gu-video" controls="controls" poster="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/22/1413965304598/New-ebola-pic-018.jpg"> <source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/10/21/141021EbolaFinal-16x9.mp4"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/10/21/141021EbolaFinal_3gpLg16x9.3gp"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/10/21/141021EbolaFinal_3gpSml16x9.3gp"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/10/21/141021EbolaFinal/141021EbolaFinal.m3u8"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/10/21/141021EbolaFinal.webm"></source> </video> <figcaption>Ebola virus: how it spreads and what it does to you – video</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But 4,800 beds is more than are currently planned. The US, which is leading the response in Liberia, has promised 17 new treatment centres with beds for 1,700 patients in Montserrado. As of 15 October, Liberia, according to the World Health Organisation, had 620 Ebola beds, 21% of the planned total of 2,930 for the country.</p> <p>“Findings of our analysis suggest that the capacity of Ebola virus disease treatment centres needed to reduce the severity of the current outbreak greatly exceeds current international commitments,” the authors write.</p> <p>Other scientists questioned whether it was possible to model the progression of a fast-moving epidemic in the way the Yale authors have and Neil Ferguson, professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London, said the number of new cases had already plateaued in the area. “It’s too early to say whether the ongoing and intense control efforts in Monrovia have yet achieved control or merely slowed the epidemic, but what is being seen on the ground is clearly incompatible with the results in this paper,” he said.</p> <p>But others said the predictions were valid and useful. “There are so many unknowns in this current outbreak, especially the true number of infected individuals, but despite the uncertainties, this work generates a roadmap highlighting the most effective methods of containment and the impacts of past and future delays on our ability to stop this outbreak,” said Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a meeting of the WHO’s emergency committee has urged countries unaffected by Ebola not to introduce travel bans to and from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, which may lead to more people attempting to leave the epidemic countries. “A general travel ban is likely to cause economic hardship, and could consequently increase the uncontrolled migration of people from affected countries, raising the risk of international spread of Ebola,” it said in a statement.</p> <p>It urged the normalisation of air and sea traffic, to reduce the economic damage the region is suffering.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/23/doctor-treated-ebola-patients-hospital-new-york <p>A physician who recently returned from west Africa was taken to hospital in New York City on Thursday after displaying symptoms consistent with those caused by Ebola.</p> <p>A New York city councilman, Mark Levine, identified the man as Craig Spencer, 33, a doctor who lives in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. A preliminary test confirming whether he has Ebola is expected by early Friday morning. </p> <p>Health officials said they were beginning to trace the doctor’s contacts, which New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said were not numerous. <br /></p> <p>“It is our understanding very few people were in direct contact with him,” de Blasio told a news conference. “Every protocol has been followed. We’re hoping for a good outcome for this individual,” he said. </p> <p>City health officials said the patient worked in one of the three west African countries affected by Ebola, which has killed more than 4,500 people since the current outbreak began. It said he returned to the United States within the last 21 days, which is the maximum incubation period for the virus.<br /></p> <p>The physician was transported by a team wearing protective gear to Bellevue hospital with a fever and “gastrointestinal symptoms”. Though <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/diseases/ebola-stmt-nyc.shtml">the city’s statement</a> did not specify, severe diarrhoea is a common Ebola symptom.<br /></p> <p>“A person in New York City, who recently worked with Doctors Without Borders in one of the Ebola-affected countries in West Africa, notified our office this morning to report having developed a fever,” Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. <br /></p> <p>The aid organisation said its healthcare worker was being monitored by local officials and had reported his fever immediately to the agency, per its guidelines for returning field workers. It’s unclear whether the doctor had been quarantining himself.</p> <p>The organisation declined to give further information on the health worker.</p> <p>A journalist for Reuters reported seeing a woman at the Bellevue information desk who identified herself to a staff member as the patient’s fiancee. The news agency said she appeared very agitated and declined to comment.</p>  <figure class="element element-image element--thumbnail" data-media-id="b72af97174bd52f7039c181bf6ee9249256dcd0a"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/23/1414101897236/8c6c3fe4-ad79-4c83-b007-f9f7220f937b-460x276.jpeg" alt="spencer ebola" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Craig Spencer</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: LinkedIn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Spencer’s public Facebook page, which has since been taken down, showed a photo of him dated 18 September wearing protective gear announcing he was heading to Guinea with Doctors without Borders. It showed him checking into a location in Brussels on 16 October.</p> <p>His LinkedIn profile identified him as a fellow of international emergency medicine at Columbia University-New York Presbyterian Hospital.</p> <p>New York Presbyterian Hospital released a statement in which it did not identify Spencer by name but called the patient “a dedicated humanitarian on the staff of NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center who went to an area of medical crisis to help a desperately underserved population”.</p> <p>It said he has not returned to work at the hospital or seen any patients since returning from west Africa.</p> <p>Leaders have attempted to reassure New Yorkers that the city and state are safe. City health officials repeated that Ebola is difficult to contract, since people must come into direct contact with body fluids of an infected and symptomatic person.<br /></p> <p>Many fears about the disease have swirled around New York’s status as a transportation hub. Airports in the metropolitan area process the majority of passengers arriving from west African everyday, and John F Kennedy International Airport and Newark, New Jersey’s airport are now among <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/21/us-limited-ebola-travel-restrictions-west-africa">only airports in the US accepting such passengers</a>. Beginning Monday, passengers from the worst affected countries, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, will be monitored for 21 days after arriving in the US.<br /></p> <p>As part of the governor’s Ebola preparedness plan, two ambulances are being regularly stationed at JFK and Newark airports, the city’s transit authority was provided with protective gear and training, and unannounced drills are being conducted at airports, college campuses and in subways. The governor designated eight hospitals in the state to handle Ebola patients.<br /></p> <p>To abate healthcare workers’ fears about the disease, New York City held an Ebola educational session on Tuesday. </p> <p>“In this country, with every passing day, we’re getting better and better at dealing with this challenge,” Mayor Bill de Blasio told healthcare workers on Tuesday. “This city, as you heard before, has been preparing and drilling for weeks and weeks. We’re getting better at it. And we know that we’re ready.”</p> <p>Cuomo said New York is prepared to handle even the, “slightest possibility of disease.”</p> <p>“Protecting the people of this state is one of our top priorities in government, and I want all New Yorkers to know that we are doing everything necessary to safeguard against the risks of Ebola,” Cuomo said in a statement last week. “New Yorkers should rest assured that we are taking the steps to be fully prepared for whatever the future brings.”</p> <p>Preparedness efforts ramped up after a Liberian man in Dallas, who later died of Ebola, was sent home for two days with a high fever, symptomatic and infected. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan">He later returned to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where he was diagnosed with </a>the virus. </p> <p><br />Two nurses of the about 70 who cared for the man, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, later became ill.

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/23/cuba-healthcare-lessons-ebola-sierra-leone-guinea-liberia <p>Guatemala, Pakistan, Indonesia, Haiti. Four different nations that share a common experience: in the past decade, they were all struck by natural disasters which overwhelmed their under-staffed and under-funded public health systems. Into the rubble, flooding, and chaos of these distinct cultures and contexts, Cuba dispatched a specialised disaster and epidemic control team to support local health providers. It was a story of unprecedented medical solidarity by a developing country which few media outlets picked up – until now. </p> <p>The <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2010/01/201013195514870782.html">Henry Reeve Brigade</a>, as it’s known, was established in 2005 by more than 1,500 Cuban health professionals trained in disaster medicine and infectious disease containment; built on 40 years of medical aid experience, the volunteer team was outfitted with essential medicines and equipment and prepared to deploy to US regions ravaged by Hurricane Katrina (<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/12/14/medical-internationalism-in-cuba/">the offer was rejected by the Bush administration</a>). Today, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/cuba-leads-fights-against-ebola-africa">Cuba’s Henry Reeve Brigade is the largest medical team on the ground in west Africa battling Ebola</a>.</p> <p>The small island nation has pledged 461 doctors and nurses to provide care in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, the largest single-country offer of healthcare workers to date. While United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon decried the pallid aid commitment from around the globe calling for <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16240.doc.htm">“a 20-fold resource mobilisation and at least a 20-fold surge in assistance”</a> Cuba already had 165 of these specially-trained healthcare workers on the ground in Sierra Leone. Each of these volunteers,<a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/analysis/cuba-outpaces-canada-in-medical-diplomacy-278885201.html"> chosen from a pool of 15,000 candidates who stepped forward to serve in west Africa</a>, has extensive disaster response experience. </p> <p>Nevertheless, preparation for this mission required additional, rigorous training at Havana’s <a href="http://www.ianphi.org/membercountries/memberinformation/cuba.html">Pedro Kourí Institute of Tropical Medicine</a> with biosecurity experts from the United States and the <a href="http://www.paho.org/">Pan American Health Organisation</a>. This rapid mobilisation of sorely-needed health professionals begs the question: how can a poor developing country spare qualified, experienced doctors and nurses? </p> <p>By pursuing a robust medical education strategy, coupled with a preventive, community-based approach, Cuba, a country of just 11.2 million inhabitants, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/salim-lamrani/cubas-health-care-system-_b_5649968.html">has achieved a health picture on par with the world’s most developed nations</a>. This didn’t happen overnight. Rather, Cuba’s admirable health report card results from decades of honing a strategy designed specifically for a resource-scarce setting. </p> <p>By <a href="http://medicc.org/mediccreview/index.php?issue=24&amp;id=295&amp;a=vahtml">locating primary care doctors in neighbourhoods and emphasising disease prevention</a>, the health system – which is universal and free at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels – makes care accessible and keeps people as healthy as possible, as long as possible, saving resources for more expensive treatments and interventions in the process. </p> <p>But prevention and health promotion by community-based healthcare workers are only part of the story. Cuba’s policies and practices, both at home and abroad (currently more than 50,000 Cuban health professionals are serving in 66 countries) are built on several principles proven effective in resource-scarce settings. </p> <p>First, coordinating health policies at the local, regional, and national levels is essential; this is particularly important where infectious diseases are concerned since uniform protocols are integral to containment. <br /></p> <p>Next, health initiatives must be cross-sectoral and based on integrated messages and actions. A fragmented, uncoordinated response by and among different agencies can prove dangerous and even deadly. This <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2794567/nurses-caring-ebola-patient-thomas-eric-duncan-didn-t-wear-hazmat-suits-two-days-admitted-hospital.html">was tragically illustrated by the death of Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas</a> and the US Centers for Disease Control allowing a nurse who has Ebola <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ebola-nurse-called-cdc-several-times/">to travel on a commercial flight</a>. <br /></p> <p>Finally, infectious disease outbreaks must be addressed quickly – easier said than done in poor settings, where public health systems are already strained or collapsing already. </p> <p>The Ebola outbreak snaps the need for Cuba’s approach into sharp relief: only a coordinated response, provided by well-trained and - equipped primary healthcare professionals will contain this – and future – epidemics. Indeed, policymakers such as <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-surging-beyond-control-who-s-margaret-chan-warns-1.2764285">World Health Organisation’s Margaret Chan</a> and<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/17/john-kerry-ebola_n_6003302.html"> US secretary of state John Kerry</a> have lauded the Cuban response, underscoring the importance of collaboration as the only solution to this global health crisis. <br /></p> <p>Forging this solution, however, requires harnessing the political will across borders and agencies to marshal resources and know-how. Havana took up the challenge by <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/20/us-health-ebola-cuba-summit-idUSKCN0I917820141020">hosting a special Summit on Ebola</a> with its regional partners and global health authorities on 20 October. Noticeably absent were US health representatives; if we’re to construct a comprehensive, integrated, and effective global response, all resources and experiences must be coordinated and brought to bear, regardless of political differences. Anything less and Ebola wins. </p> <p><em>Conner Gorry is senior editor of </em><a href="http://www.medicc.org/mediccreview/"><em>Medicc Review</em></a><em>.

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/23/ebola-outbreak-food-scarcity-social-conflict <p>Farmers in Liberia are too frightened to work together in their fields, fertilisers and seeds are stuck on the other side of closed borders, markets are almost empty, people have less money because jobs that involve physical contact with others are disappearing, and prices for everything from cassava to palm oil are rising.</p> <p>It’s a devastating chain reaction sparked by an unprecedented outbreak of disease in one of the world’s poorest countries. Beyond the high mortality rate and human suffering, aid agencies fear the fabric of a society that endured a brutal civil conflict may be ruined.</p> <p>Ten months after the Ebola outbreak started in Guinea, evidence is mounting that the crisis may be reversing more than a decade of fitful progress in west Africa.</p> <p>Simon O’Connell, <a href="http://www.mercycorps.org.uk/liberia" title="">regional director for aid group Mercy Corps</a>, says that – despite several years of 6%-8% growth and significant development gains – Liberia’s gross domestic product per capita is still only about $450 (£281), a figure below prewar levels in 1989.</p> <p>“It’s taken that entire period, from the war ending in 2003, to just about get back to those prewar levels,” he said. “Then we see the price spikes, this disruption in access to markets, and also the breaking down of social fabrics, the trust between communities, between different demographics and between communities and governments.</p> <p>“We are … trying to ensure that this outbreak doesn’t undermine development gains and, of course, there is a risk of that the longer the crisis plays out.”</p> <p>Before this crisis, Liberia was rebuilding after a 14-year period during which there were two civil wars (1989-1996; 1999-2003). More than 250,000 people were killed in the conflicts. Reconstruction was slow: before the Ebola outbreak, the country had only about 50 doctors for a population of more than 4 million. Now, even that progress has been threatened because of a disease that has <a href="http://www.humanitarianresponse.info/system/files/documents/files/WA_A4_L_141020_Ebola_Epidemic.pdf" title="">killed more than 2,700 Liberians</a> (pdf).</p> <p>Mercy Corps, which has been in Liberia since 2002, has carried out an assessment of households and markets in Liberia’s remote Lofa and Nimba counties, and around the capital, Monrovia. It found that 55% of households have experienced a reduction in incomes, 60% have higher expenses, and nearly half are eating fewer meals.</p> <p>There are fewer trucks on the road – either because they are unable to travel during the 11pm-6am curfew or because drivers do not want to venture into remote areas.</p> <p>Mercy Corps found rice prices had risen by about 20% while commodities such as palm oil had risen by up to 50% in Monrovia. These findings are echoed by other agencies: the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation says cassava prices have risen by about 150%.</p> <p>Shenggen Fan, director general of the <a href="http://www.ifpri.org" title="">International Food Policy Research Institute</a>, says <a href="http://dgcorner.ifpri.info/2014/10/09/preventing-an-ebola-related-food-crisis/" title="">smaller harvests are expected for both staple and cash crops</a> because of quarantined zones and restrictions on movement in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</p> <p>“These disruptions in production, labour markets and trade/transportation have serious implications for food security and nutrition of poor and vulnerable groups,” Fan said. “Poor people spend a large proportion – about 50-70% – of their income on food, so rapid increases in the prices of staple foods harm them by reducing their … access to food.</p> <p>“The health impacts of Ebola are devastating. But without prompt action by national governments and the international community, Ebola can trigger a food crisis that may persist beyond the disease’s lifecycle.”</p> <p>Ebola has changed the way people farm in Liberia. “One of the major changes is that the <em>kuus </em>agricultural labour system is not functioning as it was previously. This is a pooling of labour and it used to [involve] between 30 and 50 people. It is now being reduced to smaller groups, between five and 10 people. This has led to a significant reduction in agricultural production,” said O’Connell. “It’s a sort of spiralling effect overall, which is compounding the situation.” The famine early warning systems network, Fewsnet, has said <a href="http://www.fews.net/sites/default/files/documents/reports/FEWSNET_Ebola%20Outbreak%20Briefing_10_08_final.pdf" title="">about 1.3 million people could need emergency food aid from January</a> (pdf) in the three countries.</p> <p>Fears are rising that the disease, and the attendant social upheaval, could lead to unrest in countries where a large proportion of the population is young and unemployed. In a September briefing note, the International Crisis Group said the <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/media-releases/2014/africa/statement-on-ebola-and-conflict-in-west-africa.aspx" title="">health crisis risked becoming a political crisis</a>.</p> <p>“Adding social breakdown to the epidemic would create disaster perhaps impossible to manage,” it said. “The Ebola epidemic has exposed citizens’ lack of trust in their governments and the grave potential for deep unrest in these already fragile societies. In all three countries, past civil conflicts fuelled by local and regional antagonisms could resurface.”</p> <p>US officials are also worried about food insecurity. “We have Fewsnet tracking key indicators like market prices, the price of staples and the ability to get to market. These are all factors that are contributing to rising food insecurity and for that reason, not only are we responding to controlling the outbreak but also looking – through the World Food Programme [WFP] and others – at how to address food security,” said Nancy Lindborg, USAid’s assistant administrator for the bureau for democracy, conflict and humanitarian assistance.</p> <p>While food shortages are an issue, people’s inability to afford food because of declining purchasing power is also a problem, said Alexis Masciarelli, WFP’s regional spokesman. “What’s important is not so much the prices. It’s more the purchasing power [of households] … Plantations have closed, mines are closed, schools have closed and there is no investment,” he said.</p> <p>“Liberia remains one of poorest countries in the world, with tremendous needs … this is a humanitarian crisis on an unprecedented scale,” said O’Connell. “Much more mobilisation is needed in a much more multilateral way, much quicker so we can respond at speed and at scale.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/23/ebola-malware-spam-email-world-health-organization <p>If you’ve got an email in your inbox from the World Health Organization offering “information and prevention” tips about Ebola, don’t click on its attachment – you’re likely to end up with a nasty digital infection.</p> <p>Cybercriminals are using the current Ebola outbreak as a topical hook for spam emails that can install malware giving them remote access to computers, including logging key presses, capturing video from webcams and stealing passwords.</p> <p>Online Security firm Trustwave’s SpiderLabs team of ethical hackers published details of the scam yesterday, noting that emails pretend to be from the World Health Organization.</p> <p>“The information and prevention listed in the attached file will help you and those around you stay safe,” claims one email <a href="http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2014/10/spam-campaign-taking-advantage-of-ebola-scare-may-lead-to-malware-infections.html">published on SpiderLabs’ blog</a>.</p> <p>“There is an outbreak of Ebola and other diseases around that you know nothing about. Download the World Health Organization file for more information on how to stay safe from Ebola and other preventable diseases. We care.”</p> <p>Well, the creators of the email care about installing something called the “DarkComet Remote Access Trojan” which can run on computers “undetected by antivirus software” according to SpiderLabs.</p> <p>Here comes the caveat: there’s no evidence yet that this particular spam campaign is a serious threat. “We’ve only seen one sample from this campaign so far. At this time we don’t have reason to believe it is a widespread campaign,” notes SpiderLabs’ blog post.</p> <p>“The address it was sent to was an old honeypot address, so it’s not exactly targeted either. These facts taken together suggest a low volume campaign (sent to whatever address list the spammer is using) in an attempt to infect random users in the hope of gaining some data that can be used or sold.”</p> <p>The more important point, though, is that any topical news event is fuel for cybercriminals, so any unexpected email in your inbox about Ebola should be treated with caution.</p> <p>SpiderLabs points to another campaign is pretending to offer advice from the Mexican government about Ebola prevention, for example.</p> <p>It also notes <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2014/10/16/Ebola-Phishing-Scams-and-Malware-Campaigns">a recent warning from the US Department of Homeland Security’s Computer Emergency Readiness Team</a> (US-CERT) about Ebola-related phishing and malware campaigns.</p> <p>• <strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/01/cheryl-cole-celebrity-virus-malware-mcafee">Cheryl Cole is ‘most dangerous’ UK celebrity for viruses</a></strong><br /></p>

Instead, the Liberian man was sent home with only painkillers and antibiotics. Duncan's family and his fiancée are haunted by the question of whether Duncan might have survived had he been properly diagnosed. Executives at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital have admitted to mistakes and apologized to Duncan's family.</p><p>But should Duncan's family members seek more than an apology, and ask the courts to hold the hospital accountable for its missteps, they won't find much recourse under Texas law. Neither will the nurses who contracted Ebola while treating Duncan, apparently for a time without sufficient safety gear, nor will anyone who might have contracted the virus from them later.</p><p>Thanks to a number of Texas court decisions and laws – including a sweeping 2003 Republican-led tort reform effort – lawyers say it's unlikely that Presbyterian faces serious legal risk from the Ebola cases or others like them. Even if the hospital were found liable in court, the damages would be limited. Without the threat of expensive litigation, critics of tort reform argue, hospitals face little consequence for turning away sick, uninsured patients, even ones with Ebola.</p><p>The Dallas Morning News has reported that Duncan's family members are considering a lawsuit against the hospital. The first challenge they would face is probably the greatest: proving that Duncan ever had a better-than-even chance of survival once he'd contracted the virus. With Ebola's global mortality rate estimated recently at 70%, doctors and hospitals are probably safe from ever answering for even the most blatant malpractice against an Ebola patient. That's not necessarily true in states where courts have adopted what's known as a "loss of chance" doctrine allowing lawsuits even when the chance of survival is under 50%. But Texas' courts have consistently shut the door to that possibility, ruling that if a patient was likely to die, then the hospital can't be held liable for malpractice.</p><p>If there were a way past that barrier, Duncan's family would face the same obstacles any other patient has since Texas' 2003 tort reform law took effect. The law requires emergency room patients to prove not just negligence on the part of hospital staff but "willful and wanton" negligence. That "emergency room standard" is one of a few changes introduced in the tort reform law that raised the standard for lawsuits against hospitals. Another section of the law, related to hospitals' responsibility for credentialing dangerous doctors, has protected another Dallas-area hospital from litigation over a dangerous Dallas neurosurgeon who killed two patients and paralyzed four others in a series of botched surgeries.</p><p>Paula Sweeney, a Dallas attorney with the law firm Slack and Davis and a former president of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association, says Duncan's family will have a difficult time proving wanton negligence. Though Presbyterian sent Duncan home after his first trip to the emergency room, the hospital staff did perform a CT scan and offer some treatment for his fever. "Yes, they screwed up; yes, they turned away a guy with a fever with antibiotics," Sweeney says. "But they did do something."</p><p>That minimum level of treatment is all that Texas courts would require, she says, and Duncan couldn't have paid for much more treatment, anyway. In that sense at least, his case is hardly unique. "I think the treatment was more in line with somebody that doesn't have insurance," Sweeney says.</p><p>Sweeney says plaintiffs may have a better chance proving the hospital was willfully negligent after Duncan returned to the emergency room. By then, hospitals everywhere would have been more alert to the possibility of patients arriving with Ebola, but according to some nurses' complaints, the hospital was still slow to treat him. At that point, though, it would be even harder to prove that the hospital's slow reaction time caused Duncan's death, because he was already so ill.</p><p>If Duncan's family somehow overcomes all those barriers, Texas law ensures the hospital won't pay much. The 2003 tort reform law capped pain and suffering damages for hospitals, in a case like Duncan's, at $500,000 – a quarter-million each for the doctor and the hospital. Because Duncan's income was fairly low – he was recently unemployed, and worked for a shipping firm in Liberia before that – his lost wages wouldn't add much to any pain and suffering award.</p><p>There's been plenty of media speculation that the two nurses who contracted Ebola while caring for Duncan might take the hospital to court over alleged poor working conditions. Texas Presbyterian nurse Briana Aguirre complained recently that nurses were never given the proper gear to treat an Ebola patient safely. Duncan's medical records suggest the safety lapses went on for days. It seems that any competent trial attorney could argue that Presbyterian was a dangerous place to work. The nurses union, National Nurses United, has alleged that Duncan wasn't isolated immediately and was left in the emergency room for hours, that nurses didn't have proper protective suits and that the hospital had no protocol for handling an Ebola patient. Hospital executives and other nurses have defended Texas Presbyterian. They contend that, as the first U.S. hospital to deal with a walk-in Ebola patient, there were bound to be some problems—isolated mistakes in a hospital that generally provides good care.</p><p>That issue will likely never reach a jury. Texas law likely prevents the nurses from pursuing litigation, attorneys say. Because Presbyterian's employees are covered by workers' compensation insurance, they can file claims for their health care and lost workdays but can't sue the hospital. Sweeney notes that, thanks to a 2012 Texas supreme court decision, even a nurse who isn't covered by workers' compensation would face the same challenges as any patient trying to sue. In Texas West Oaks Hospital, LP v Williams, the state supreme court determined that a "health care liability claim" isn't limited to patients suing over health care, but also covers nurses suing over an unsafe workplace, or even a hospital visitor who slips and falls. Any of those cases would have to meet the same tough liability standards that apply to patients.</p><p>And what if someone outside Texas Presbyterian caught Ebola from one of those nurses? They wouldn't be covered by the hospital's workers' compensation insurance, so they'd be free to sue. But a late-1990s Texas supreme court decision, Praesel v Johnson, established that in Texas, doctors aren't responsible if a patient harms someone else.</p><p>Sweeney says the Ebola case in Dallas is "the ultimate example" of what tort reform has meant to Texas. "Look at the catastrophic risk to people involved, to the health care providers, to the community, and there's no risk to the insurance company," she says. To Sweeney, tort reform's most insidious effect has been that hospitals are less scared of screwing up.</p><p>"You always hear about, 'Doctors are practicing defensive medicine because they're afraid of lawsuits," Sweeney says. "The whole point of this Ebola case is they did not practice defensive medicine. We as a society expect them to practice defensive medicine. And the worst thing that can happen is a half-a-million dollar judgment. Big deal!"</p><p>Tort reform supporters in Texas say those concerns are overblown. "The trial lawyers always say no one can file a lawsuit under the ER standard or collect, that's the complaint that I hear," said Mike Hull, an attorney for the Texas Alliance for Patient Access, a coalition of doctors, hospitals and insurance companies. "[Our] data is that there've been a little over 2,600 ER lawsuits under the new standard, and a little over $120 million in payouts. So the notion that no one files suit under the new standard or collects under it is false."</p><p>Hull said he wasn't sure how that compared to the years before tort reform, but a study by University of Texas law professor Charles Silver showed that in the first four years under Texas' 2003 tort reform law, the number of malpractice claims decreased 60%  and payouts dropped by a third. Silver's work has also shown that hospitals could institute tighter safety and quality controls, but aren't incentivized to do so.</p><p>This is an old argument in Texas by now, one that's often left Silver and Hull in disagreement. But they do agree that Duncan's family would have a tough case, if only because Ebola is so deadly and because pure self-interest would incentivize doctors to keep it under control. "The ridiculously high standard that Texas adopted with respect to ER doctors could affect the level of care that they use," Silver says, "but I don't think that Ebola fits within the ordinary boundaries."</p><p>And Silver says there isn't much chance the courts will change Texas' standards because of anything that's happened in the past few weeks. "The Texas Supreme Court is notoriously anti-plaintiff and pro-health care provider. It seems extremely unlikely that they would expand the law in this particular area."</p><p>In an op-ed published in The Dallas Morning News last week, Duncan's nephew Josephus Weeks left little doubt that he places the blame squarely on the hospital. "Their error set the wheels in motion for my uncle's death and additional Ebola cases," he wrote, "and their ignorance, incompetence or indecency has created a national security threat for our country."</p><p>But given the state of Texas law, a strongly worded letter may be all the recourse Duncan's family has.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/22/ebola-africa-threat-uk-sally-davies-who-public-health-england <p>Britain is well prepared for an Ebola outbreak but the best way to ensure the threat to the UK does not escalate is to fight the disease in west Africa, the chief medical officer for England, said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Dame Sally Davies told MPs on the Commons health select committee that airport screening had been introduced mainly to alert people coming from Ebola-affected countries as to what to do should they develop symptoms.</p> <p>She conceded that the screening was not mandatory and said one person so far had refused to comply with a request to have their temperature taken and answer a questionnaire covering any contacts with sick people.</p> <p>“Public Health England followed [him]up. I believe he is well,” she said. She did not know who the traveller was because of data protection rules.</p> <p>Davies said her message to the international community was: “We need to act now because if we leave it longer there will not only be more deaths and heartache, [and] it will cost vastly more.”</p> <p>She said she wanted to tell the British public: “The risks are very low, the planning is very good and we should see very few cases – and it is not airborne.”</p> <p>Davies was speaking as more details emerged about plans to bring experimental vaccines and treatments to the Ebola outbreak countries Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed that within a matter of weeks some patients could be given blood from survivors who have developed antibodies against the virus.</p> <p>Vaccines were likely to be tried on health workers and burial teams in the new year, although only in the context of large-scale clinical trials.</p> <p>Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general at the WHO, said: “I’m not saying there will be mass population immunisation starting in January 2015. This is not the case. We’re talking about tens of thousands of doses, not millions, in January.”</p> <p>Until the vaccines were given to people on the “frontline”, scientists could not say whether they would protect against the virus, however an unprecedented manufacturing effort had begun.</p> <p>GlaxoSmithKline was reported to be producing 10,000 doses of its vaccine, while 800 vials of a Canadian vaccine had arrived in Geneva, ready for the treatment’s first human trials.</p> <p>The company Johnson &amp; Johnson said it would manufacture more than a million doses of its own treatment, 250,000 of which would be available for trials before May.</p> <p>The WHO released figures showing there have been 9,936 cases and 4,877 Ebola deaths so far in the latest outbreak. The numbers are doubling every three or four weeks.</p> <p>MPs expressed concerns about how prepared GP practices in the UK might be for dealing safely with anyone walking into a waiting room with symptoms of Ebola. A&amp;E hospital staff had told committee members that they did not know where their storage areas were for personal protective equipment.</p> <p>Davies said: “I think they should know where it is, how to put it on, and, more importantly, how to take it off – and have agreed about who will be the first to do it.” Information and training was available to NHS staff; and she hoped they would recognise it was in their interests to be ready.</p> <p>The risk assessment modelling suggested there would be only a handful of cases in the UK at worst before Christmas, Davies said, so the threat to the UK was low, but that could change depending on how the epidemic developed in west Africa. “We may have to revise it up, which would be sad, or down, which is more likely.”</p> <p>Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at Public Health England, said his staff, who were doing the entry screening, had legal powers to act if someone was ill. “If somebody is unwell at a port of entry there are very clear powers where we can provide for somebody to be taken to an appropriate place of isolation and assessment,” he said. The traveller would have to be obviously sick.</p> <p>Davies said that in the event of someone arriving from west Africa with a fever and entering a district general hospital or GP practice, the reaction might be “say hello, [say] here’s a glass of water and I’m shutting the door and will call the experts to work out what to do”.</p> <p>She added: “If you do think it is Ebola the ambulance service will be asked to move them to another place where they have more expertise.”</p> <p>The Royal Free, Davies said, was the specialist centre but there were also beds in Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield. More needed to be done, however, to ensure NHS staff knew what to do in the unlikely event of a case.</p> <p>“I don’t think we are where we need to be, but the risk is low at the moment,” she warned. “This isn’t infection control as they are used to it, where they need to protect the patient; this is more like the pilot who if he makes the mistake goes down with the aircraft,” she said.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/22/us-cameraman-recovers-ebola-nebraska-ashoka-mukpo <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has announced it will monitor for 21 days anyone entering the United States from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, west African nations that have been hard-hid by the Ebola virus. </p> <p>Beginning Monday, travellers from those nations will be expected to check in with health officials daily, and provide updates on their temperatures and any possible Ebola symptoms. The move was announced Wednesday, a day after the Obama administration <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/21/us-limited-ebola-travel-restrictions-west-africa">announced new restrictions</a> on travellers from the same three countries, routing them through the US airports with Ebola-screening procedures in place.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the American cameraman who contracted Ebola while covering the outbreak in Liberia as an NBC freelancer has been cleared of the virus and is due to leave the specialist unit in Omaha where he was nursed to health.</p> <p>Ashoka Mukpo, 33, has been receiving treatment at a biocontainment unit at Nebraska medical centre in Omaha since arriving in the US on 6 October.

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/22/cuban-doctors-west-africa-fight-ebola <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/cuba-leads-fights-against-ebola-africa" title="">Cuba’s large-scale deployment of medical staff</a> to fight the west African Ebola outbreak continued on Wednesday as planes carrying 91 doctors and nurses from the Caribbean island arrived in Liberia and Guinea.</p> <p>Havana has pledged more health professionals to combat the disease than any other government, with 461 Cuban doctors and nurses receiving specialist training for a six-month mission to the affected countries. Cuba has already deployed 165 medical workers to Sierra Leone, bringing its total presence in the three countries to 256.</p> <p>Speaking before they flew to Liberia, two Cuban doctors told Reuters that competition to join the west African mission – which attracted 15,000 volunteers – had been fierce. “There have been fights breaking out, heated arguments, with some doctors asking, ‘How come my colleague gets to go and I can’t?’,” said Dr Adrian Benítez.</p> <p>His colleague Leonardo Fernández said the volunteers had felt compelled to help. “We know that we are fighting against something that we don’t totally understand. We know what can happen. We know we’re going to a hostile environment,” he said. “But it is our duty. That’s how we’ve been educated.”</p> <p>Cuba’s rapid and generous response to the epidemic, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/22/ebola-serum-in-weeks-and-west-africa-vaccine-tests-by-january-says-who" title="">which has killed more than 4,500 people in west Africa</a>, has been recognised by both humanitarian agencies and its traditional foes in Washington.</p> <p>“The international response has been slow … The virus is spreading faster than we’re all setting up,” Sean Casey, director of the International Medical Corps’s emergency response team in Liberia told AFP. “It’s good that the Cubans are coming. We need more countries to step up.”</p> <p>Last week the US secretary of state, John Kerry, broke with decades of US criticism of the communist state when <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2014/10/233091.htm" title="">he praised Cuba for its “impressive” efforts</a> to tackle Ebola. “Cuba, a country of just 11 million people, has sent 165 health professionals and it plans to send nearly 300 more,” he told foreign diplomats in Washington.</p> <p>On Tuesday, US officials went further, saying they were happy to be cooperating with Havana. “We welcome the opportunity to collaborate with Cuba to confront the Ebola outbreak. Cuba is making significant contributions by sending hundreds of health workers to Africa,” a state department source told AFP. “In that spirit, the US department of state is communicating with all members of the international community, including Cuba, involved in this global effort through multilateral channels such as the World Health Organisation as well as diplomatic briefings.”</p> <p>Additional evidence of a thawing of the cold war enmity came last weekend when an article by Fidel Castro appeared in state media announcing that Cuba would “gladly cooperate with American personnel” on Ebola. The sentiment was echoed a few days later by his brother, Raúl, who succeeded him as Cuba’s president eight years ago.</p> <p>The island has long used medical diplomacy and its “<em>ejército de batas blancas</em>” (army of white coats) to fight US efforts to label it a pariah on the international stage.</p> <p>The country prizes its universal healthcare system and, since 1960, has sent 135,000 health workers overseas for emergency response or to work in under-served communities. Cuba has 50,000 doctors and nurses working in 66 countries across Latin America, Africa and Asia, according to the health ministry.</p> <p>The doctors have also become a key source of billions of dollars a year in revenue since 2004, when Havana began charging host governments for their services.</p> <p>The Cuban deployment has underlined the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/17/ebola-funding-how-much-where" title="">vast disparities in the humanitarian response from different countries</a>. On Wednesday, US officials called on some European countries to contribute more money and medical personnel to the fight.</p> <p>Ambassador Donald Lu, the state department’s deputy coordinator for Ebola response, said that although 35 countries had so far pledged $690m to combat the disease, the UN still needed at least another $623m.</p> <p>“More than half of these 35 countries are from Europe; Europe has a long tradition of leadership in humanitarian crises and we are very grateful for the leadership shown by the European people in this global response effort,” he said. “In our consultations, we have heard that European countries are poised to make some major new pledges in the coming days. But while we recognise European leadership, we also want to emphasise that the current pledges are not enough to defeat the epidemic.”</p> <p>The UK has so far committed £125m and 750 military personnel to fighting Ebola in Sierra Leone, a former British colony. Last week, Justine Greening, the UK international development secretary, called on world leaders <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-britain-david-cameron-ban-ki-moon" title="">to “wake up” to the crisis</a>. David Cameron voiced similar concerns, saying: “We are doing a huge amount and I think it’s time for other countries to look at their responsibilities and their resources and act in a similar way to what Britain is doing in Sierra Leone, America’s doing in Liberia, France is doing in Guinea.”</p> <p>Cameron’s intervention was designed to step up pressure on other EU leaders to agree to increase their contributions to fighting Ebola at a summit in Brussels this week. It is felt that Germany could make a greater contribution of cash and medical resources, while France has further to go in Guinea to match Britain’s efforts in Sierra Leone.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/22/ebola-serum-in-weeks-and-west-africa-vaccine-tests-by-january-says-who <p>The World Health Organisation has announced it hopes to begin testing two experimental Ebola vaccines in west Africa by January and may have a blood serum treatment available for use in Liberia within two weeks.<br /></p> <p>The UN’s health agency said it aimed to begin testing the two vaccines in the new year on more than 20,000 frontline health care workers and others in west Africa – a bigger rollout than previously envisioned.</p> <p>Separately, a senior Red Cross official said he was confident the epidemic could be contained within four to six months. </p> <p>Elhadj As Sy, the secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday that the outbreak could be contained if there was “good isolation, good treatment of the cases which are confirmed, good dignified and safe burials of deceased people.”</p> <p>Dr Marie Paule Kieny, an assistant director general at the WHO, said the first tens of thousands of Ebola vaccines could be distributed in the first months of the new year. Kieny acknowledged there were many “ifs” remaining and “still a possibility that it [a vaccine] will fail”. But she sketched out a much broader experiment than was imagined only six months ago.</p> <p>“These are quite large trials,” she said.</p>  <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/22/ebola-virus-how-it-spreads-video"                        data-show-ads="true"                data-video-id="2179174"                data-video-name="Ebola virus: how it spreads and what it does to you – video"                data-video-provider="guardian.co.uk"                data-video-poster="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/22/1413965303218/New-ebola-pic-017.jpg"> <video data-media-id="gu-video-450290457" class="gu-video" controls="controls" poster="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/22/1413965304598/New-ebola-pic-018.jpg"> <source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/10/21/141021EbolaFinal-16x9.mp4"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/10/21/141021EbolaFinal_3gpLg16x9.3gp"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/10/21/141021EbolaFinal_3gpSml16x9.3gp"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/10/21/141021EbolaFinal/141021EbolaFinal.m3u8"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/10/21/141021EbolaFinal.webm"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Kieny said in remarks reported by the BBC that a serum was also being developed for use in Liberia based on antibodies extracted from the blood of Ebola survivors. “There are partnerships which are starting to be put in place to have capacity in the three countries to safely extract plasma and make preparation that can be used for the treatment of infective patients.</p> <p>“The partnership which is moving the quickest will be in Liberia where we hope that in the coming weeks there will be facilities set up to collect the blood, treat the blood and be able to process it for use.”</p> <p>A WHO spokeswoman, Fadela Chaib, said the agency expected 20,000 vaccinations in January and similar numbers in the months afterwards using the trial products.</p> <p>An effective vaccine would still not in itself be enough to stop the outbreak but could protect the medical workers who are central to the effort. More than 200 of them have died of Ebola.</p> <p>The real-world testing in west Africa will go forward only if the vaccines prove safe and trigger an adequate immune-system response in volunteers during clinical trials that are either under way or planned in Europe, Africa and the US. The preliminary safety data is expected to become available by December.</p> <p>One of the vaccines that Kieny mentioned, Okairos AG, is being developed by the US National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline from a modified chimpanzee-cold virus and an Ebola protein. It is being made in Rome, according to GSK, with clinical trials under way in Britain and Mali.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Graphic: the search for an Ebola vaccine">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1413976045731/ebola_vaccine.svg&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>“We have other vaccine facilities around the world and we are seeing what we can do to ramp up production to commercial scale,” said Mary Anne Rhyne, GSK’s US director of external communications.</p> <p>The second frontrunner, developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and known as VSV-EBOV, has been sent to the US Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland for testing on healthy volunteers. It would also be tested shortly among volunteers in Switzerland, Germany, Gabon and Kenya, Kieny said.</p> <p>Separately, the Canadian drugmaker Tekmira Pharmaceuticals announced on Tuesday it had begun limited manufacturing of a therapeutic product targeting the Ebola-Guinea virus.</p> <p>Tekmira said on Tuesday that the new product, part of its TKM-Ebola programme, would be available by early December. But it did not specify how many doses it was making, or whether it was a drug or vaccine. Its TKM-Ebola programme is aimed at developing a treatment to stop the virus replicating in an infected person.</p> <p>The European Medicines Agency said on Monday it was ready to offer Ebola treatments and vaccines the benefits of “orphan” drug status – including extended market exclusivity – in a bid to encourage their development. </p> <p>Orphan drug status is given to compel companies to develop treatments for rare conditions, which they might not otherwise make because of lower profit chances.</p> <p>Mapp Biopharmaceutical – which gave its experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp to US medical workers Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who recovered after contracting Ebola in Liberia, and to at least one Spanish priest, who died – said it had begun manufacturing the drug using conventional methods that would produce greater quantities for more human testing.</p> <p>The outbreak in west Africa has killed more than 4,500 people, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, since it began 10 months ago. Experts have said the world could see 10,000 new cases a week in two months if authorities did not take stronger steps.</p> <p>Sierra Leone said on Tuesday the number of infected people in the country’s western region was soaring, with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/21/ebola-cases-sierra-leone-increasing-above-20-deaths-day">more than 20 deaths a day</a>. The region is on the opposite side of the country from where the first cases emerged.</p> <p>Also on Tuesday, the WHO’s Chaib promised a thorough public audit of the agency’s early missteps in responding to the Ebola crisis but said for the moment “our focus is on the response”.</p> <p><em>Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/22/spanish-nurse-teresa-romero-ramos-clear-ebola <p>A Spanish nurse who contracted Ebola was on Tuesday given the all clear when health authorities said she no longer has any traces of the virus in her blood after more than two weeks in hospital</p> <p>Several successive tests for Teresa Romero Ramos have come back negative, said José Ramón Arribas from Madrid’s Carlos III Hospital. “We consider that she has met the criteria for being cured,” he said, adding: “Patients with Ebola can be completely cured and live a normal life.”</p> <p>She is expected to remain in hospital for at least two more weeks to recover. “It’s one thing to test negative for Ebola in the blood, and another to talk about what the virus has done to her,” said her doctor, Fernando de la Calle. Romero Ramos, 44, was treated with a serum containing antibodies from Ebola survivors and anti-viral drugs.</p> <p>In early October <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/ebola-outbreak-six-quarantined-in-spain-madrid-hospital-ramos" title="">Romero Ramos tested positive for Ebola</a>, becoming the first known person in the current outbreak to contract the virus outside west Africa. The auxiliary nurse had been part of a team attending to two Ebola patients who had been evacuated from west Africa to Madrid for treatment.</p> <p>After it emerged that Romero Ramos had been complaining of a fever for nearly a week before being tested for Ebola, health authorities began monitoring more than 80 people who had been in contact with her prior to her diagnosis. Fifteen people, including her husband and three workers from a hair salon where Romero Ramos went for an appointment in late September, remain in quarantine in Madrid’s Carlos III hospital. None have shown any symptoms to date.</p> <p>On Tuesday, family friend Teresa Mesa said that the past few weeks had been incredibly trying for Romero Ramos and her family. “There was a moment when she thought she was going to die,” said Mesa. In an effort to not upset her during her recovery, her friends and family had not yet told her that her <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/excalibur-spanish-ebola-patient-dog-euthanised" title="">dog, Excalibur, had been put down</a>.</p> <p>In the tense weeks that followed the nurse’s diagnosis, healthcare workers spoke out about how ill-prepared the country had been to face the threat of Ebola.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the association that represents nurses in Spain backed the claims with a report detailing what they saw as shortcomings in how authorities had managed the Ebola crisis.</p> <p>“There were so many risk factors,” said Máximo González Jurado of the Consejo General de Enfermería. “But did authorities take all necessary measures to minimise these risks? Our report says they did not.”</p> <p>Based on first-hand interviews with nursing staff at Madrid’s Carlos III hospital, the 148-page report paints a picture of scant training, missing protocols and substandard equipment. One nurse, just back from vacation, was put on the night shift to attend to a patient with Ebola with no training. Of the six nurses who treated one of the Ebola patients, only four had received 30 minutes of training. Just two of them had ever practiced putting on or taking off the protective equipment.</p> <p>Staff was not trained on how to handle or dispose of any of the potentially infectious waste materials from the rooms. The two sanitary workers tasked with removing the body of one of the Ebola patients after he died from the virus were not given any special training.</p> <p>The report also details various flaws in the equipment, from gloves that were shorter than required, goggles that fogged up and antiseptic that had to be replaced after it emerged that it could create small holes in the protective suits.</p> <p>González Jurado pointed to these risks to refute the claim by Madrid health authorities that Romero Ramos may have contracted the disease by touching her face while still wearing her gloves. “We’ll never know how Romero Ramos was infected with Ebola.” He said that all of the information collected would be submitted to Spain’s general prosecutor, who is looking into how Ebola was managed in Spain.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/21/help-deal-with-ebola-outbreak <p>As we have seen with the terrible Ebola outbreak, Africa still has huge problems (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2014/oct/20/dr-stella-ameyo-adadevoh-ebola-doctor-nigeria-hero" title="">On the Ebola frontline, G2, 21 October</a>). Why doesn’t each of the EU countries adopt an African nation, to make a difference by practical help, leadership, technology and encouragement? <a href="http://www.scotland-malawipartnership.org" title="">Scotland adopted Malawi a while ago</a>. It would be interesting to see which EU countries could make the most difference to its adoptee – and all would learn from a competitive spirit and from each other. Africa need not be like it is. It has the long-term capability to be a great resource in the world economy as a supplier and as a market. It could also help relieve the problems associated with migration to the EU (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/-sp-migrants-tales-asylum-sea-mediterranean" title="">Record numbers of migrants have died in the Mediterranean</a>, 21 October). If Africa’s economies could be fully developed, perhaps its peoples would not need to risk death to escape. <br /><strong>Frank Cannon</strong><br /><em>Glasgow</em></p> <p>• Korto Williams makes a crucial point in arguing that an holistic approach is essential in dealing with Ebola (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/19/bigger-questions-around-ebola-outbreak" title="">Letters, 20 October</a>). Simply sending money will not work, not just because so much will be skimmed off to support the lifestyles of corrupt politicians, but because so often countries in that region do not have the capacity to implement top-down solutions. In my own experience working on HIV/Aids in Malawi, Unicef made the fundamental error of insisting on imposing a grand strategy – in a country without the framework of governance to implement it. What the country did and does have is a huge number of dedicated and capable people who would be able to cope if only they had the support they needed to do so. Simple measures such as providing health workers with bicycles to travel between villages has a vastly greater potential to help in a country without adequate public transport.<br /><strong>Dr Richard Carter</strong><br /><em>London</em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/21/ebola-cases-sierra-leone-increasing-above-20-deaths-day <p>The number of people infected with Ebola in western Sierra Leone is increasing to more than 20 deaths daily, according to government estimates.</p> <p>Forty-nine new cases of were confirmed on Monday in two Ebola zones in and around the capital Freetown, the National Ebola Response Center reported on Tuesday. There are 851 total confirmed cases in the two zones, called Western Area Urban and Western Area Rural, the centre said. The Ebola outbreak <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-27615171" title="">previously primarily affected eastern Sierra Leone</a>.</p> <p>Claude Kamanda, a lawmaker who represents a western area, told <a href="http://politicosl.com/2014/09/quarantined-homes-without-food-in-waterloo/" title="">local newspaper Politico</a> that more than 20 deaths are being reported daily, and authorities are struggling to keep up with the collection of corpses from homes in the area.</p> <p>Authorities say the rise in the number of cases in the west can be attributed to the movement of people from the interior of the country to Waterloo, which is the gateway to Freetown, the capital. In response to the increased number of cases, authorities have quarantined Waterloo, in Western Area Rural, a local newspaper reported.</p> <p>“The growing fear has left the public with no choice but to call on the government for Waterloo to be quarantined as was done to other places including Kailahun, Kenema, Bombali, Port Loko and Moyamba districts,” the Exclusive newspaper said. The World Food Programme (WFP) delivered emergency food rations to people in the area over the weekend.</p> <p>In the west African nations of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea – where the outbreak first began 10 months ago – Ebola cases have risen sharply with the death toll exceeding 4,500, according to World Health Organisation estimates. Some cases have also emerged in the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/dallas-ebola-watchlist-virus-contact" title="">United States</a> and Spain.</p> <p>On Monday, there were no new cases reported in the eastern districts of Kenema and Kailahun, which previously had been at the epicentre of the outbreak in Sierra Leone earlier this year. There have been a total of 1,012 confirmed cases in that region so far. There was no immediate official explanation of what has caused the drop in reported new cases in those eastern areas. Margaret Harris, the WHO spokeswoman in Sierra Leone, said it was “definitely too early to say its been beaten there.”</p> <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/world/africa/ebola-sierra-leone-west-africa.html?_r=0" title="">Denial from community leaders and mismanagement of the response</a> to the crisis have been blamed for failures in tackling the outbreak. With the number of cases mounting, health workers have struggled to bring Ebola patients into clinics and hospitals for treatment. Last week a meeting of international health officials voted in favour of treating people in their homes by providing them with painkillers, protective gloves and rehydration fluid. The timely collection of highly infectious corpses is an important part of attempts to contain the outbreak.</p> <p>Ebola was declared an international health emergency earlier this year. There have been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/dallas-ebola-watchlist-virus-contact" title="">three confirmed cases in the US</a>, and one in Spain. Several airlines have grounded flights to affected west African countries.</p> <p>A programme of screening for passengers with Ebola-like symptoms began at London’s Heathrow airport last week. Gatwick followed suit on Monday, and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras station is expected to start soon.</p> <p>On Tuesday Rwanda’s ministry of health singled out passengers arriving from all five affected countries, saying they will have their temperatures taken upon arrival, and if they are found to have a fever, he or she will be denied entry. According to the CDC, signs of infection include a temperature in excess of 38.6C, as well as additional symptoms such as headache, muscle pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. Rwanda’s health ministry said that even if a passenger exhibits no signs of fever, they must still report their health condition daily to authorities.</p> <p>Ebola is believed to have claimed the lives of eight people in Nigeria earlier this year. After six weeks without a new case of the virus, however, it was declared Ebola-free on Monday after launching a very successful public health policy which could serve as a model for the rest of the world.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/21/us-limited-ebola-travel-restrictions-west-africa <p>The Obama administration has announced America’s first Ebola-related travel restrictions, forcing passengers originating from affected countries in west Africa to fly via US airports with screening procedures in place.<br /></p> <p>The limited move comes after <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/ebola-republicans-pressure-ebola-travel-bans-west-africa">days of mounting political pressure</a> to introduce outright travel bans on such passengers entering the US, but will instead make sure all recent travellers to Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea are subject to basic tests for fever and face questioning on possible exposure to the disease.</p> <p>“We are continually evaluating whether additional restrictions or added screening and precautionary measures are necessary to protect the American people and will act accordingly,” added Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/news/2014/10/21/statement-secretary-johnson-travel-restrictions-and-protective-measures-prevent">in a statement</a>.</p> <p>Five US airports – New York’s JFK, Newark, Dulles, Atlanta and Chicago – now have the additional Ebola screening protocols in place, which are designed to supplement exit screenings that take place in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea,<br /></p> <p>There are no direct flights from these three countries into the US, but passengers who have been there in the last 21 days and travel through foreign airports will now be required to first enter the US through one of these five airports. They already handle more than 90% of such travel, according to US officials.</p> <p>“All passengers arriving in the United States whose travel originates in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will be required to fly into one of the five airports that have the enhanced screening and additional resources in place,” said Johnson.</p> <p>“We are working closely with the airlines to implement these restrictions with minimal travel disruption. If not already handled by the airlines, the few impacted travellers should contact the airlines for rebooking, as needed.” </p> <p>Previously, the administration had insisted that the screening arrangements at the five airports would be sufficient because only a small number of travellers from west Africa arrived through other cities.</p> <p>But speaking after the latest announcement, which follows a similar climbdown on its earlier opposition to appointing a single Ebola “czar” to co-ordinate its response, White House officials insisted US policy against wider travel restrictions was not shifting.</p> <p>“Our views on the travel ban have not changed,” said spokesman Josh Earnest. “The president has reached the conclusion, with the help of expert advisers, that a travel ban would only serve to put the American public at greater risk.”</p> <p>It said the new homeland security arrangements had taken some time to put in place because of the need to liaise with third-party countries in Europe, where many passengers from west Africa travel through on their way to the US.</p> <p>Ironically, the news came as Rwanda announced new travel restrictions on travellers arriving from the US and Spain, the two countries outside Africa with confirmed Ebola infections.</p> <p>“Visitors who have been in the United States or Spain during the last 22 days are now required to report their medical condition – regardless of whether they are experiencing symptoms of Ebola,” said a statement from Rwandan officials.</p>

But three cases do not a national crisis make.</p> <p>An election, however, is <em>always</em> a crisis. And the first rule of a political crisis is to look like you’re doing something<em>.</em></p> <p>Three weeks out from a US midterm election, Republicans and Democrats have both worked to make a political catastrophe for their opponents out of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/panic-epidemic-ebola-us">the western media’s hysteria in response to Ebola</a> – which health experts believe could reach <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/world/africa/ebola-epidemic-who-west-africa.html">10,000 new cases a week</a> by December ... in West Africa.</p> <p>Fox example, take Republican congressman Tom Price of Georgia – a physician representing us here in suburban Atlanta, minutes from the Centers for Disease Control – who <a href="http://tomprice.house.gov/press-release/price-obama%E2%80%99s-ebola-czar-%E2%80%9C-unserious-gesture-incredibly-serious-moment%E2%80%9D#sthash.tSohXV9m.dpuf">criticized the Obama administration</a> right after it named Ron Klain the new “Ebola czar” to coordinate the national response:<br /></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Rather than putting another person in charge, President Obama needs to task every agency already involved in this crisis – those with real medical expertise and crisis management – with reviewing existing policies and protocols to determine what’s effective, what’s ineffective and what more should be done to stop the expansion of the Ebola outbreak abroad and protect Americans here at home.</p> </blockquote> <p>Except that putting another person in charge is <em>exactly</em> what Republicans demanded in the days leading up to Klain’s appointment. Senator John McCain called for a coordinating czar last week, as did several other Republicans – including Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas.</p> <p>Moran’s call for a czar came <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/gop-senators-who-opposed-obama-%E2%80%9Cczars%E2%80%9D-now-want-one-for-ebola-192811900.html">despite a long record</a> of opposing Obama administration czars as a symbol of federal overreach and wasteful spending. No matter. It’s a crisis. An election is upon us, and Ebola is on television. <em>Do something.</em></p> <p>So Moran responded to the appointment by describing Klain as a mere political operative with a title undeserving of the post he demanded the administration create:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This is a real crisis and worthy of an individual with extensive background in international diplomacy, experience coordinating large-scale interagency missions, as well as a proven ability to work with Congress and across the aisle.</p> </blockquote> <p>Klain isn’t a doctor. He’s a lawyer. He’s not there to tell physicians how to scrub – he’s there to be <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/20/ebola-czar-to-skip-house-hearing-aide-says/">invited to hearings he doesn’t want to go to</a> and yelled at by guys like McCain and Moran and eventually blamed for whatever goes wrong. I can think of no better fate for a Washington attorney.<br /></p> <p>The need to do something – anything – about Ebola<em> </em>also turned political orthodoxy on its head, with partisan charges and countercharges about how poorly the CDC has been funded and by whom. Rep Jack Kingston (R-GA), who had been running for the US senate this year on a platform of reducing government, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ_DWtt7piQ">took to local television</a> to assert that “whatever they’re asking for, we in Congress are giving it to them, just recently $30m to the CDC, $58m to [the Biological Advanced Research and Development Agency] to try to develop vaccines.”</p> <p>But where was that money last year – or any of the years before? Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/12/ebola-vaccine_n_5974148.html">told the Huffington Post last week</a> that the NIH had been working on Ebola vaccines since 2001. “Frankly, if we had not gone through our 10-year slide in research support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this that would’ve gone through clinical trials and would have been ready.”</p> <p>Spending on Ebola vaccine research fell from $37m in 2010 to $18m in 2014 – forcing the NIH to shelve a quarter of its grants on Ebola research, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-making-ebola-a-partisan-issue/2014/10/17/53227888-55fd-11e4-892e-602188e70e9c_story.html">according to the Washington Post</a>.</p> <p>Republicans have been quick to note that the Obama administration’s budget for 2013 and 2014 <a href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2013/04/cdc-preparedness-funds-take-hit-proposed-2014-budget">cut spending</a> for the CDC, <a href="http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/charge-that-gop-cuts-have-stymied-ebola-efforts-doesn%E2%80%99t-add-up/ar-BB9Reaa">but that Congress boosted it above the budget request</a> – calling foul on Democratic campaign ads highlighting reduced expenditures. They have been less eager to note that spending has fallen in both nominal and real dollars for most of the last decade, largely as a function of general budgetary intransigence instigated by Republicans. (That’s the sort of thing that led to the fiscal cliff and the grand compromise of the sequester, which cut federal budgets by 10 percent across the board.)</p> <p>Ebola is not coming to kill you – though the nonstop speculative hysteria about it on television might sting. The tragedy today is how it takes the perception of a crisis for policymakers to treat public health like a serious issue.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/21/willain-pooleys-parents-back-ebola-survivors-return-africa <p>The parents of the British nurse who survived Ebola have backed his decision to return to Sierra Leone and revealed that their son felt he was destined to care for the sick.</p> <p>Before his second stint in the disease-hit country, Will Pooley<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/19/will-pooley-ebola-returns-to-sierra-leone" title=""> told the Guardian that he could not stand “idly by” and watch more people die</a>, despite the concerns of his friends and family.</p> <p>His parents, Robin and Jackie Pooley, spoke of their pride at their son’s bravery in the facing the risk of catching the disease again.</p> <p>“‘We knew from the start that he would go back. We were sort of counting down the days … knowing him we were quite aware that he hadn’t finished with his task in Sierra Leone,” Jackie Pooley told <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04lpzyp" title="">BBC Radio 4’s Today programme</a>.</p> <p>She said she did not try to dissuade her son from returning to Africa. “You bring up your children to be independent, you want them to live happy and fulfilled lives … Looking at the pictures of him when he was working out there he looked happy – he looked as if he was doing what he really wanted to be doing. You can’t put a spanner in the works when your children have found something that really fulfils them ...</p> <p>“Very few people find that sort of fulfilment in their work. We can only support him and we do 100%.”</p> <p>Robin Pooley added: “When I spoke to him about looking happy, he said: ‘Dad, I felt it was what I was made for this’. And he’s lucky.”</p> <p>The Suffolk nurse has been told that he may have immunity from the disease, but there is no scientific evidence for this. In his interview for the Guardian, Pooley said he would take the same kind of stringent precautions as the other health workers treating victims of the virus.</p> <p>Pooley has begun working at an isolation unit at a hospital in the Sierra Leone capital, Freetown, after arriving in the country on Sunday. Before he left, <a href="http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/eyke_britain_s_first_ebola_sufferer_nurse_will_pooley_returns_to_africa_as_thousands_of_people_continue_to_die_1_3812207" title="">he said his potential immunity should help allay the concerns of his family</a>.</p> <p>He said: “I know my mum and dad are worried but they support me because they know this is something I have to do.</p> <p>“My potential immunity is very reassuring for them, or at least it should be, and I will be returning in a more organised fashion than when I was out there originally.”</p> <p>Robin Pooley said it was impossible to know whether his son could catch Ebola for a second time. “Nobody is clear because the experience of the disease is so limited,” he<a href="https://audioboom.com/boos/2581025-ebola-survivor-will-pooley-told-his-father-dad-i-felt-it-was-what-i-was-made-for-this" title=""> told the BBC</a>.</p> <p>“They think he has some immunity, but there’s no certainty. Anyway, he has got to pretend he could catch it again in order to show best practice to the people he will be training.”</p> <p>The Pooleys said Britain and the international community was failing to do enough to stop the spread of Ebola.</p> <p>Robin Pooley said: “I know Britain is doing more than a lot of countries, but the west has got to step up to this, and what’s being done already is inadequate … the disease is doubling every four weeks.”</p> <p>When Pooley contracted the disease in Sierra Leone in August he was flown back to the UK and treated in a special isolation unit at the Royal Free hospital in London. He recovered after receiving the experimental drug ZMapp, and has since donated some of his blood in case it offers clues about how to treat the virus.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/21/rapper-camron-dipset-issues-ebola-surgical-masks-merchandise <p>Cam’ron is vowing to protect fans from Ebola with his newest piece of merchandise: a surgical mask. Although the virus cannot be spread through the air, the Dipset rapper claims the official Cam’ron Ebola Mask will “provide complete protection” from the deadly disease.</p> <p>“Wrap it up and protect yourself from Ebola just like Killa Cam!” reads the copy in <a href="http://store.dipsetusa.com/item/29076">Dipset’s official online shop</a> (via <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/10/camron-is-selling-camron-ebola-masks.html">Vulture</a>).

Be fashionable.” But prospective purchasers should be advised: even the most hip-hop surgical mask does not change the fact that Ebola travels via body fluids such as blood. Still, Cam’ron’s new merchandise was able to appeal to some buyers: “Buying 100 @Mr_Camron ebola masks just in case this shit spreads to canada,” <a href="https://twitter.com/thaBigGENERAL/status/523567817619435520">one fan wrote</a>.</p> <p>Cam’ron’s concern does not extend across the music scene. The rapper TI arrived in Ethiopia on 18 October, en route to a concert in Tanzania. Although he posted photographs of his visit to an Ebola <a href="http://instagram.com/p/uSIVOIAble/?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=photo">checking centre</a>, he has mostly ignored the epidemic (there have been no reported Ebola cases in Tanzania or Ethiopia, after all). Instead, TI has written about the beauty of the land and the “ultradope”, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/uUVfjQAbhK/?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=photo&amp;modal=true">“megaturnt” gig</a>, encouraging others to visit the area.</p> <p>So far, deaths from Ebola have exceeded 4,500.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 21 October 2014 to amend a figure for deaths from Ebola. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention gives the figure as at least 4,555.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/21/ebola-exit-screening-most-efficient-says-lancet-study <p>Fewer than three people a month infected with the Ebola virus are likely to try to board planes out of west Africa, according to a study that says exit screening would be the most efficient way to try to prevent travellers spreading disease.</p> <p>The UK and US have set up entry screening at airports for passengers arriving from west Africa, but <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61828-6/abstract">the paper in the Lancet medical journal</a> says this will have little chance of detecting somebody infected with the virus and that it will cost money that could be better spent.</p> <p>The paper is written by Dr Kamran Khan at St Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, Canada, and colleagues. The team analysed worldwide flight schedules from 2014, taking account of the routes that have been suspended because of the crisis, and flight itineraries from 2013 to establish the population’s normal travel patterns. They used World Health Organisation data on Ebola virus infections.</p> <p>The authors say that restricting air travel from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, where the epidemic is raging, is damaging to the countries’ economies and may potentially handicap efforts to end the Ebola outbreak, which is the best way to safeguard the rest of the world.</p> <p>They found that most travellers from the three countries – more than 60% – fly to low- and middle-income countries, with Ghana and Senegal as the top destinations. The arrival of somebody infected with Ebola is a greater threat to less affluent countries than to the UK, which was the third most popular destination, with 8.7% of travellers, or to the USA, where 2% would be headed.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Map: travel from west Africa">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1413907463618/Ebola_Air_Travel_WEB.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>“Given that these countries have limited medical and public health resources, they may have difficulty quickly identifying and effectively responding to imported Ebola cases,” said Khan.</p> <p>“The risk of international spread could increase significantly if the outbreak in west Africa persists and grows. Risks to the global community would further increase if Ebola virus were to spread to and within other countries with weak public health systems.”</p> <p>Screening passengers either at exit or entry will miss cases, the paper says, because of the long incubation period of the virus – up to 21 days. Because many direct flights to countries like the UK have been stopped, travellers anyway have to change planes or use additional forms of transport and may not be identified as coming from west Africa.</p> <p>Exit screening in the capital cities of Conakry, Freetown and Monrovia “would offer greater efficiency, and might be simpler to operationalise, than entry screening all flights arriving directly from affected countries,” says the paper. But it needs support from the international community, because the west African states are in the middle of an emergency.</p> <p>A lot of attention has been focused on ways in which affluent countries can protect their populations, Khan told the Guardian, including travel bans. But, he said, “the most proactive way is to decrease the many new infections in the source region itself”.</p> <p>While a ban might make people far from west Africa feel more secure, he said: “Our analysis suggests the opposite. Decreasing the number of infections in the source area is the most important way to decrease the spread.”</p> <p>Other experts commented, however, that political considerations will often trump scientific analysis.</p> <p>“What this research fails to consider,” said Dr Adam Kamradt-Scott, senior lecturer in international security studies, at the University of Sydney, “is that in public health crises like Ebola the political pressure on leaders to be seen to be doing everything they can to protect their citizens is immense. We can have the best available evidence, but it won’t amount to a hill of beans if we don’t also understand the politics behind these events.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/nurses-defend-dallas-hospital-death-ebola-patient-thomas-eric-duncan <p> Nurses at the Dallas hospital where a Liberian man died from Ebola after infecting two healthcare workers held a press conference on Monday to defend the institution.</p> <p>“The reason we’re here today is to make sure that people know Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas is still a great hospital, an excellent hospital,” said chief nursing officer Cole Edmonson.</p> <p>Once one of the state’s finest hospitals, Presbyterian has seen its sterling reputation marred by its handling of the Ebola cases, the first to be diagnosed in the US. The hospital recently<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/18/texas-ebola-hospital-presbyproud-fightback-criticism"> hired Burson-Marsteller</a>, a New York-based PR firm, to combat the criticism it received after Thomas Eric Duncan, who contracted the disease in Liberia before coming to the US, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan">died there from Ebola</a>. </p> <p>Edmonson said the hospital, and all staff involved in the effort to keep Duncan alive, were devastated by his death. Duncan died on 8 October, eight days after his diagnosis was confirmed. </p> <p>“Our hearts are heavy,” he said. His passing was a real loss for us as well as his family.” </p> <p>After his death, Duncan’s family criticised the hospital for misdiagnosing Duncan on his first visit, despite having a high fever and telling a nurse he had travelled from west Africa. </p> <p>But some of the sharpest criticism has reportedly come from the hospital’s own nurses. Last week, the nation’s largest nurses’ union,<a href="http://www.nationalnursesunited.org/blog/entry/statement-by-registered-nurses-at-texas-health-presbyterian-hospital-in-dal/"> National Nurses United</a>, alleged that some Presbyterian nurses were moved to blow the whistle on the hospital for not providing healthcare workers adequate protective gear while treating Duncan. </p> <p>The allegations came hours after it was announced that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/ebola-nurse-transferred-texas-maryland-special-unit">Nina Pham had contracted Ebola</a>. She cared for Duncan in the days after he was admitted but not yet diagnosed, a period the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called high risk for health care workers as Duncan was producing large amounts of highly contagious body fluids including vomit and diarrhoea.</p> <p>“Were protocols breached?” asked the union in a statement last week. “The nurses say there were no protocols.”</p> <p>Julie Boling, an emergency department nurse who has been at the hospital for 20 years, said at Monday’s conference that Presbyterian should not be judged on this incident alone. She said that this would have happened at any hospital in America where Ebola was first discovered. </p> <p>“Some things went wrong and we’re proud to say that Presbyterian has owned those things,” she said. </p> <p>Speaking for the dozens of nurses at the news conference, Boling said: “We’ll stand behind this hospital.”</p> <p>The hospital also announced on Monday that it would begin accepting ambulances at its emergency room again. The hospital had diverted emergency calls to other hospitals to focus its resources on caring for the nurses who had become ill. The emergency department was however still open for patients who did not arrive by ambulance. </p>
http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/20/john-crace-politics-sketch-defence-russian-submarine-commons-trafalgar <p>‘The Royal Navy is still, without doubt, the best in the world,” said Labour MP Stephen Pound to rousing grunts of approval from the Conservative benches. “How then is the minister planning to celebrate Trafalgar Day?” Junior minister Philip Dunne pushed his crutches out of harm’s way and struggled on to his one good foot; the other is wrapped in a plastic cast, having been presumably hit by a stray cannon ball in a battle re-enactment at the weekend. “Kiss me, Poundy,” he sobbed as the morphine wore off, before adding his thanks to the navy for saving us from the French in 1805.</p> <p>Defence questions are like a game of poker in which both sides know they are bluffing, but have come to a gentleman’s agreement that their hands are full of aces. One day a defence secretary may be caught off guard after a psychotherapy session and say: “You know what? We’ve got little global influence, less money and our combat troops barely run into double figures. I can barely keep the Red Arrows in the air, so what you expect me to do about Ukraine, Isis and Ebola, I have no idea.”</p> <p>Until then, though, the Commons is stuck in a Trafalgar past where the future of the world is dependent on the British armed services for its continued wellbeing. Was Britain paying enough attention to hostile activity in northern waters? Indeed it was, replied defence secretary Michael Fallon, a slightly more menacing doppelgänger of Geoffrey Howe. “I will be going to a conference in Oslo next month,” he said. The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/19/sweden-search-russian-submarine-stockholm" title="">Russian submarine lurking off Stockholm</a> immediately took flight.</p> <p>Though only for the time being as Rory Stewart, the Mick Jagger of the Commons, with the hair of an 18-year old and the face of a corpse, exclusively revealed that Russia was planning a major war in 2018 or 2019. He didn’t say who the Russians would be fighting, though, or even if the Russians knew about it, but if it’s in Ukraine we can all rest easy as Fallon had that situation fully under control. “We will be sending four Typhoons there next year,” he said. “And we will also be setting up a brigade HQ.” Just as soon as he had cleared it with Captain Darling.</p> <p>All this activity was sufficiently hectic for the shadow defence secretary, Vernon ‘Big Vern’ Coaker, to remain almost silent throughout, and the rest of the session degenerated into an Airfix model development meeting. “We need more modalities,” said Fallon. Everyone nodded. “We also need greater granularity in the programme,” Dunne added. “The new Type 26 will be modular.”</p> <p>There was even time for Julian Brazier to make his ministerial debut after a mere 27 years on the backbenches. It would be hard to find a more suitable minister for the reserves. They also serve who only stand and wait. “I thank my honourable friend for his kind welcoming of my unexpected mobilisation,” he said, before answering a swerve ball from Barry Sheerman about whether the government would meet its target number of army reservists. It would indeed. “I should tell him that these targets are extremely low,” he confided. There was a shocked silence. Brazier had made the schoolboy error of telling the truth about defence. A full military reprimand was in order.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2014/oct/20/dr-stella-ameyo-adadevoh-ebola-doctor-nigeria-hero <p>Last month, the Nigerian government released the 2014 National Honours award list: more than 300 people, many of them serving government officials, seemingly recognised simply because of the public office they hold, not for anything particularly honourable or heroic. An outcry followed, largely due to the absence of one name: Dr Stella Ameyo Adadevoh. A government spokesman was forced to explain that the awards are never given posthumously. </p> <p>The public’s indignation was understandable: Adadevoh was the Nigerian doctor who oversaw the treatment of Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian national who brought the Ebola virus to Nigeria. She died of the virus on 19 August, one of eight fatalities out of 20 cases (each linked to Sawyer) in the country. Without her dedication, it is quite possible that the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/nigeria-declared-ebola-free-must-remain-vigilant">World Health Organisation would not have declared Nigeria – the most populous country in Africa – Ebola-free</a> on Monday. The significance of her actions, and those of her hospital colleagues, cannot be overstated.</p> <p>According to an account by Ada Igonoh, a young doctor who treated Sawyer – and upon whom it fell to certify him dead – Adadevoh vehemently turned down a request by Sawyer’s employers to have him discharged so he could catch a flight to Calabar, a coastal city 750km from Lagos, where he had been due to attend a conference (we are left to imagine what would have followed had Sawyer been allowed to leave Lagos for Calabar).</p> <p>Igonoh says that from the moment Adadevoh suspected Sawyer might have Ebola – the Liberian had denied contact with an Ebola patient, even though his sister had died of the virus barely two weeks before his arrival in Nigeria – she quarantined him, made contact with the authorities, and ensured the provision of protective materials and Ebola educational material to hospital staff.</p> <p>Adadevoh was born in Lagos in October 1956. Her father was Babatunde Adadevoh, a professor of chemical pathology and, between 1978 and 1980, the vice-chancellor of the University of Lagos. Her great-grandfather was the Nigerian nationalist Herbert Macaulay (himself the grandson of Samuel Ajayi Crowther, the first African Anglican bishop). She lived most of her life in Lagos, spending the last 21 years working at the First Consultant hospital in Obalende on Lagos Island, where a statue of Macaulay still stands today.</p> <p>In a fine tribute, Nigerian journalist Simon Kolawole explained and convincingly that Adadevoh was only doing her job as a medical professional. He wrote: “There were various options in front of her when she discovered Sawyer had Ebola: one, quietly say ‘e no concern me’ and discharge him quickly to avoid contaminating the hospital; two, refer him to [Lagos University Teaching hospital], not minding the bigger consequences for the rest of Nigeria; three, act responsibly in line with the ethics of the medical profession and ‘detain’ him because of the peculiarity of the disease.”</p> <p>That this needed to be pointed out at all is perhaps testimony to how unused Nigeria has become to the idea of people doing their jobs as they should. It is precisely the reason Adadevoh needs to be honoured: as a reminder that heroism can be attained as much in everyday work clothes as it can in superhero capes.</p> <p>In September, the Lagos state parliament asked Governor Babatunde Fashola to rename the Infectious Diseases hospital in Lagos – where Adadevoh died – in her memory. There is still time to further recognise Adadevoh’s heroism. No doubt the biggest tribute Nigeria could ever give her would be to create a culture in which devotion and dedication to one’s vocation is habitual.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/20/china-companies-contributions-ebola-fight <p>China’s corporations and billionaires have lagged behind in contributions to fighting the Ebola epidemic in west Africa, despite multiple economic ties to the region, the World Food Programme said on Monday.</p> <p>The Ebola outbreak in west Africa, the worst on record, has killed more than 4,000 people. China has contributed about $40m (£25m) in aid towards fighting the disease, including $6m to the World Food Programme.</p> <p>“Where are the Chinese billionaires and their potential impact? Because this is the time that they could really have such a huge impact,” said Brett Rierson, the organisation’s representative in China, at a briefing.</p> <p>“You can ask the same thing of the corporate sector, being the largest investors in west Africa right now.“</p> <p>The Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group, a Chinese drug company with military ties, has sent several thousand doses of an experimental Ebola drug to Africa and is planning clinical trials there.</p> <p>China has also sent hundreds of aid workers to Africa to help.</p> <p>Dudley Thomas, Liberia’s ambassador to China, told Reuters that his country had secured one donation of $100,000 from a large Chinese building firm that has projects in the country, but few other contributions.</p> <p>He added that Liberia’s government was in talks with other large Chinese investors, including the state-owned <a href="http://www.cdb.com.cn/english/Column.asp?ColumnId=176" title="">China-Africa Development Fund</a>, a private equity fund set up to facilitate investment between China and Africa.</p> <p>Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, said last week that he and his wife, Dr Priscilla Chan, were <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ebola-outbreak-donation-wife" title="">donating $25m towards combating </a>Ebola. The <a href="http://tinyurl.com/n5fqvz4" title="">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged $50m</a>.</p> <p>China’s donation to the WFP would be used to provide staple foods in the three hardest-hit countries, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, Rierson said.</p> <p>That puts China <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/17/ebola-funding-how-much-where" title="">among the top donors to the organisation for combating Ebola</a>. The US has contributed $12.67m and Japan $6m, Rierson added.</p> <p>China’s foreign ministry said on Monday that the country would continue to provide support.</p> <p>“The Chinese government and people have followed the development of the epidemic situation, and have provided four batches of aid to the relevant African countries and international organisations,” ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.</p> <p>The WFP said it had raised only about a third of what it needed for the anti-Ebola fight.</p> <p>Approximately a million Chinese nationals live in Africa, with about 10,000 in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.</p> <p>Mao Qun’an, a spokesman for China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission, said that, in addition to sending aid to affected countries, China had been training doctors in public hospitals in handling Ebola cases.</p> <p>China has also toughened health checks at airports in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, he added.</p> <p>“If they come across a person running a fever or with other possible symptoms of Ebola, that person will be taken directly to a local hospital,” Mao said. “These entry points are key.“</p> <p>China has not implemented any restrictions on travel to and from affected countries.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/panic-epidemic-ebola-us <p>Panic is less a side-effect of Ebola than its own sort of infectious disease, spread by misinformation and fear, a sickness that frays and tears the ways people usually get along. Hysteria shuts down schools and airports, paranoia undermines health workers and law enforcement, and fear encourages some of people’s worst instincts. As of Monday, there’s a lot more panic in the US than Ebola.</p> <p>In Strong, Maine, an elementary school put a teacher on leave because she travelled to Dallas for a conference and stayed in the Hilton Anatole – “<a href="http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2014/10/portland_maine_teacher_given_21-day_paid_leave_for_being_generally_proximate_to_ebola.php">exactly 9.5 miles away</a>” from the hospital where two nurses contracted the virus. The school <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2014/10/17/fearing-ebola-strong-elementary-teacher-on-leave-after-traveling-to-dallas/">board said parents feared</a> the teacher could have contacted someone who contacted the nurses, or maybe someone who contacted someone who contacted one of the nurses – a rationale that would have fenced Maine off from Dallas, even though dozens have been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/dallas-ebola-watchlist-virus-contact">declared healthy there</a>.</p> <p>In Georgia, a school district<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102097421#."> barred enrolment for students</a> from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea unless they can present a doctor’s clean bill of health. In Hazelhurst, Mississippi, <a href="http://www.wapt.com/news/hazlehurst-parents-concerned-with-principals-trip-to-africa/29135134">parents pulled children</a> from a middle school after learning that the principal had been to Zambia for his brother’s funeral. Zambia, just a country away from South Africa, is well over 2,000 miles away from the Ebola outbreak in west Africa. </p> <p>Nor is the mania limited to parents. Syracuse University “disinvited” a Pulitzer-winning journalist from speaking because he recently went to Liberia for work. Curiously, the dean who made the call <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/10/17/spread-of-ebola-fear-schools-caution-column/17434303/">said that while</a> “this is not what you want to do as the dean of a premier journalism school,” she was “unwilling to take <em>any </em>risk<em>”. </em>The journalist, Michel du Cille, who has shown no symptoms and even been to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for work since his return,<a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/10/syracuse_university_journalist_michel_du_cille_ebola_hysteria.html"> said</a> he is “completely weirded out that a journalism institution that should be seeking out facts and details is basically pandering to hysteria”.</p> <p>Also among the institutions that should probably know better, airlines must know by now that Ebola – contagious only through direct contact with a symptomatic sick person’s fluids – is exceedingly unlikely to contaminate a plane. But the message may not have made it to passengers and crew: on Friday an American Airlines flight crew <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/As-Ebola-fear-spreads-flight-crew-locks-sick-5829359.php">reportedly locked a woman in the bathroom </a>after she vomited into the aisle – an incident<a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/As-Ebola-fear-spreads-flight-crew-locks-sick-5829359.php#/0"> the airline said</a> was unrelated to Ebola, and only occurred because the woman “probably had food poisoning or something … she asked to remain in the lavatory for the duration of the flight”. However, a witness <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/As-Ebola-fear-spreads-flight-crew-locks-sick-5829359.php#/0">told the Houston Chronicle</a> that the crew wrapped the woman’s luggage in plastic and told her “We can’t let you out.”</p> <p>Frontier Airlines, on which one of the sick nurses flew with a low fever, has adopted a more reasonable tact: directing passengers on relevant flights to the CDC, scrubbing the plane with extra assiduity and reminding people that Ebola is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/ebola-answering-10-basic-questions">not airborne</a>, and probably never will be (when a virus mutates it almost always gets weaker or less infectious). US congressmen, on the other hand, have <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/oct/16/ebola-outbreak-texas-hospital-apologises-over-infections-as-uk-army-medics-travel-to-sierra-leone-live-updates">called for travel bans </a>that security and health experts call counter-productive.</p> <p>Nor is Ebola seaborne, but that fear prompted docks in Mexico and Belize to refuse a cruise ship on which a Texas healthcare worker was sailing. The worker helped care for but had no direct contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, who died from Ebola; the passenger voluntarily <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/ebola-cruise-ship-in-utter-panic-as-mexico-and-belize-refuse-to-let-it-dock-9804428.html">quarantined herself </a> anyway – presumably after consultation with the crew, who said the ship was returning to the US “out of an abundance of caution”. (Outbreaks of norovirus and influenza are far, far more common on cruises; the CDC even has <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/surv/gilist.htm">a page dedicated to them</a>.) The worker eventually tested negative for Ebola.</p> <p>Worst of all, as echoed in Georgia and the comments of American politicians, west Africans and their relatives are increasingly the target of discrimination fuelled by fear. One woman from Sierra Leone told the Guardian’s Sam Jones “we feel like a pariah nation”; two British landlords <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/uk-landlords-refuse-house-student-sierra-leone-ebola-fears">refused a man lodging</a>; the UN human rights chief has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/world/europe/un-human-rights-chief-denounces-funding-shortage-for-his-office.html?_r=0">denounced anti-African discrimination</a>; national soccer teams are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/ebola-africas-image-takes-a-hit/2014/10/19/4f678932-57af-11e4-9d6c-756a229d8b18_story.html">treated as security risks</a>; Pennsylvania students <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/10/pennsylvania_hs_soccer_coaches_resign_after_players_chant_ebola_jokes_at_player.html">taunted a Guinean teen</a>; Staten Island’s “Little Liberia” was dubbed “the Ebola zone”; it goes on and on, and makes even less sense than the hysteria.</p> <p>Like a terrible incarnation of <a href="http://www.psmag.com/culture/theres-a-name-for-that-the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon-59670/">the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon</a> – people learn about a virus and suddenly start seeing it everywhere – the fear is simple human psychology. The annual annoyances of flu season mutate into the irrational terror that that man on the subway looks like he broke into a sweat, and he’s leaning your way, and what if the soap at work isn’t strong enough? – is it time to buy bulk supplies of industrial-quality latex gloves? It’s not. Get a flu shot. Wash your hands. Be nice to people. Don’t panic. </p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/msf-volunteers-ebola-front-line <p>On 4 October a young nurse infected with the Ebola virus emerged from isolation at the Bégin military hospital east of Paris. While working in Liberia <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20140919-france-ebola-nurse-experimental-drugs-un-security-council-resolution/" title="">she became the first French person to be infected by a disease</a> that has claimed around 4,500 lives in west Africa since the end of March.</p> <p>She is also a Médécins sans Frontières volunteer. In the frontline of the war on Ebola the members of this organisation are directly exposed. More than 400 medical staff have been taken ill since the start of the epidemic, including 16 from MSF: 232 have died, nine from MSF, an exceptionally high number of fatalities.</p> <p>Since leaving hospital the nurse has been convalescing, recovering from the high fever the disease causes. Three days after her release a Norwegian doctor, also working for MSF, was <a href="http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/ebola/norwegian-woman-infected-with-ebola/a/23310487/" title="">flown home to Oslo after being infected</a> in Sierra Leone. As with all the other cases the NGO carefully concealed her identity, for the sake of her private life and safety.</p> <p>But why do thousands of people leave the relative comfort of jobs in hospitals, health centres and offices to work in countries that are short of almost everything and where the simplest mission becomes a battle against poverty and disease? More than 3,000 people, including 250 expatriates, have volunteered to work for MSF since the epidemic erupted in the three west African countries most severely affected: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Volunteers spend between four to six weeks at treatment units, to prevent stress and exhaustion leading to accidents. Failure to pay attention for just an instant may open the way for infection.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-0ca2fc43-dd11-490f-b4fa-b380bad1b61e"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/20/1413814741521/870469e4-8586-49cb-954d-92e351420770-460x276.jpeg" alt="MSF worker Liberia" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">An MSF health worker carries a child suspected of having Ebola in the MSF treatment centre in Paynesville, Liberia.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: John Moore/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Géraldine B, a young nurse from Luxembourg employed by the Swiss branch of MSF, worked in Guinea, then transferred to Kailahun in eastern Sierra Leone. “There are times when you feel really down. You’re afraid all the time, but it’s just as well,” she says. This is her second MSF mission, after working in Haiti last year. “Doing something useful,” is the prime motive for volunteers, but also the desire to travel. They do not often mention the fear of contamination. “I’m more afraid of the people, how they’ll react, than of the virus itself,” Géraldine adds.</p> <p>Her mission was cut short after a World Health Organisation doctor was contaminated but concealed his condition. Several MSF staff who had been in contact with him were suspect. “We had to evacuate 12 people. There was a lot of anger and frustration,” Géraldine says.</p> <p>The standards in the treatment units are nevertheless drastic. Kathryn D, 43, a water and sanitation engineer from Boston in the United States, recently returned from Liberia where she spent a fortnight setting up a unit to treat diseases other than Ebola, which complicate the key task. After nine MSF missions she is inured to the idea of falling sick: “We have procedures and we’re closely supervised,” she says. “But what struck me is that some medics are afraid of the people they’re treating.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-20c9d1bc-5572-48dc-ae9d-5d3c1beabeaa"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/20/1413814787686/e20d6ef9-b4bf-458d-86b1-51d8b536dea3-460x276.jpeg" alt="MSF training equipment" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Training equipment awaits MSF volunteers at a replica of an Ebola treatment centre, prior to them leaving to fight the virus in Africa.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though MSF personnel requirements are rising, there is no question of hiring hotheads. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/20/volunteered-fight-ebola-sierra-leone-msf" title="">The organisation employs some 25,000 people worldwide</a>, with overall expenditure amounting to €952m ($1.14bn) in 2013. Every year MSF France sends about 1,600 volunteers abroad. There is no standard profile nor age requirement, says head of human resources Marc Ferrier. “They’re still a bit militant, eager to combat the scandalous lack of resources in the south. But since the French doctors in the 1970s, MSF has turned into a multinational, with proper work contracts and a pay scale,” he adds.</p> <p>For their first year, volunteers receive a monthly tax-free allowance of €1,000, then join the staff if they decide to stay. MSF pays pension and health insurance contributions, covering all expenses including board and lodging. Medics must be able to focus exclusively on their work. Their presence is also a boon for the local economy, with jobs for cooks, drivers, guards.</p> <p>Since the mid-1980s MSF has recruited the majority of its staff on the spot. Expats, many of whom are from neighbouring countries, only account for a minority. But care is required to avoid disrupting local health services. Many doctors and nurses would rather work for the NGO, which pays higher wages than the local authorities. “We let nationals take on duties which will be useful for them later, but we make sure wages are no more than 25% higher than locally,” Ferrier explains.</p> <p>Expat MSF workers live in special camps, sometimes shared with members of the Red Cross, Red Crescent and WHO. Here men and women from all over the world coexist for months at a time. In the evenings, in their rare moments of leisure, they may talk about past missions, but somehow they are always wary, avoiding any physical contact.</p> <p><em>This article appeared in </em><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/weekly" title="">Guardian Weekly</a><em>, which incorporates material from Le Monde</em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2014/oct/20/ebola-read-about-disease-now-buy-merchandise <p>Perhaps compulsively buying Ebola products is itself a disease? If so, an epidemic of that too is brewing. Some people think the virus is all part of a conspiracy that must be exposed. Others believe it is the dawn of an apocalypse and are planning their survival. Then there are the people who just need to laugh in the face of so much sombre news (thankfully, we don’t see many of the faces of the people dying). Where there is this kind of demand, there will be supply. Here’s a selection of what’s on offer:</p> <p><strong>Halloween costume: </strong>Alarm your friends by arriving at their Halloween party <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2014/oct/21/california-company-ebola-halloween-costume-video">dressed as a health worker </a>risking their life to save others.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/dallas-ebola-watchlist-virus-contact <p>The first wave of people who may have had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan have been declared Ebola-free after 21 days of twice-daily temperature checks, bringing welcome news to a Dallas hospital that was sent into a tailspin by the discovery of the virus.</p> <p>At least 43 of the 48 people who may have come into contact with Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the US, are no longer at risk of developing the virus, the Texas department of health announced in a statement on Monday. Duncan died from Ebola on 8 October.</p> <p>“Epidemiologists have worked around the clock to call and visit people who may have had any exposure, to make sure they were asymptotic and doing well,” the Texas state health commissioner, Dr David Lakey, said in a statement.</p> <p>“I’m happy we can tell people they are free and clear of monitoring. It provides a measure of relief and reassurance.”</p> <p>Five of the students who had been under quarantine or monitoring returned to school on Monday, and the remaining students will be back in school by Tuesday, Dallas Independent School District superintendent Mike Miles said Monday.</p> <p>At a press conference on Monday morning, the Dallas mayor, Mike Rawlings, said the news marked a positive turn in the three-week drama that heightened public fear of an outbreak across the county – and the country. </p> <p>“There is no question [that] today is a milestone day, a hurdle we needed to clear,” Rawlings said. “But there are more hurdles we need to jump.”</p> <p>He warned that the state is weeks away from the “magic day” of 7 November, which is 21 days after the last possible contact that anyone in Texas could have had with a known infected person. </p> <p>The incubation period for Ebola is between two and 21 days after exposure, although symptoms typically develop between days eight and 10.</p> <p>Duncan’s fiancee, Louise Troh, was among the 43 people cleared for Ebola overnight Sunday, along with her 13-year-old son and two young men who stayed in the apartment where his condition worsened.<br /></p> <p>After Duncan was diagnosed, Troh and the three young men were quarantined in the apartment where the bedsheets he had slept on remained. After several days, they were moved into a home donated for three weeks by a member of Wilshire Baptist church, and a clean-up crew was sent in to decontaminate the apartment.</p> <p>“We are so happy this is coming to an end, and we are so grateful that none of us has shown any sign of illness,” Troh said in the statement.</p> <p>“We have lost so much, but we have our lives and we have our faith in God, which always gives us hope. Even though the quarantine is over, our time of mourning is not over. Because of that, we ask to be given privacy as we seek to rebuild our home, our family and our daily living.”</p> <p>Troh learned of her fiance’s death from her pastor, George Mason. Upon hearing the news, Troh collapsed in tears, Mason said. He was unable to embrace her because of the quarantine restrictions.</p> <p> Troh’s apartment was gutted during the decontamination process and many of her belongings were incinerated as a precaution. The city is coordinating with local church officials and private donors to help the family find housing, which Mason admitted has not been easy. Once Troh finds a place to live, the community has pledged to help her furnish the home and pay the rent.</p> <p>State officials, working with a team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), initially identified 48 people who may have had contact with Duncan before he was admitted, including healthcare workers and community members. They were checked twice daily for fever and monitored for other symptoms of the deadly disease.</p> <p>Those cleared from quarantine are people who could have had contact with Duncan up to 28 September, the day he was brought to the emergency room and isolated. The healthcare workers who treated Duncan after he was diagnosed are still being monitored, and have pledged not to go into public spaces until the end of their 21-day incubation periods. State health officials said about 120 people are being monitored.</p> <p>Dallas County judge Clay Jenkins said the remaining five people of the initial 48 identified as having had contact with Duncan will be taken off monitoring in stages over the next few days, if they don’t show symptoms; one as early as Monday afternoon.</p> <p>One was the last person potentially exposed to Duncan during the ambulance ride to the hospital and the other four are healthcare workers.</p> <p>Several school-age children who were on the monitoring list have been cleared and are due to return to school on Tuesday, said the superintendent of the Dallas independent school district, Mike Miles.</p> <p>Since Duncan’s death, two nurses who treated Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas have been diagnosed. Both have since been moved to speciality care units – one in Maryland and one in Georgia.</p> <p>One of the infected nurses, Amber Vinson, travelled back and forth to Ohio from Texas, possibly after she began to feel ill. She reported a low-grade fever on the day she flew back from Cleveland to Dallas. </p> <p>The CDC director, Tom Frieden, said Vinson should not have been allowed to travel while she was being monitored. It was later revealed that Vinson had contacted the CDC before she travelled, and was allowed to fly.</p> <p>“Suggestions that she ignored any of the physician- and government-provided protocols recommended to her are patently untrue and hurtful,” Vinson’s relatives said in a statement. “She has not and would not knowingly expose herself or anyone else,” it added.</p> <p>A group of passengers aboard one of Vinson’s two Frontier Airlines flights are being monitored for symptoms. Among those are a small group of passengers who sat within a three-foot radius of Vinson on one of the flights, who are deemed to be at a higher risk; they have been directed to stay home. </p>
http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/oct/20/ebola-volunteer-liberia-why-returned <p><em>Ella Watson-Stryker is a 34-year-old public health officer from New York. She’s currently working with Médecins sans Frontières’ (MSF) health promotion team based in Monrovia, Liberia. This is her third deployment to West Africa since March 2014 and she’s now worked in all three countries where the Ebola outbreak is ongoing.</em></p> <p>On a Thursday afternoon in March I got a phone call from <a href="http://www.msf.org.uk/?gclid=CLn9rf-Ju8ECFQ3LtAod3DAAWg">Médecins sans Frontières (MSF)</a> asking me to go to a viral-hemorrhagic fever outbreak in a remote area of Guinea. By Saturday night I was on a plane bound for Geneva and when I got off the plane I learned the virus was Ebola. Images from novels and Hollywood films flashed through my head. I knew nothing about this virus and I couldn’t, then, imagine how it would come to dominate my life. Briefings outlining our knowledge about Ebola reassured me that, with proper training, equipment, and supervision it is possible to work safely in an outbreak.</p> <p>Ebola is a virus that creates fear. Nothing else compares to it. Imagine waking up to find that people in your community are suddenly sick: no one has seen this disease before and it can kill men and women, strong and weak, young and old alike. Meanwhile, foreigners have descended upon your town. Sometimes they come to take away those who are sick, and the sick people never come home. Communities are frightened and angry and need information. It’s my team’s job to deal with the fear and anger and to give the information that can save lives.</p> <p>In an Ebola outbreak, health promotion is a combination of jobs, but my focus in Monrovia is on community dialogue. We try to create the humanitarian space that allows for our medical work. When communities are really afraid, they can even turn to violence. But we know it doesn’t have to be this way; we know that listening to the affected communities, answering their questions and giving correct information can turn resistance and doubt into cooperation. We also know that giving information on Ebola can help prevent new cases by ensuring that people know how to protect themselves.</p> <p>Health promotion is best done by local people who know their communities, and it takes a team to make it happen. In Monrovia we have more than 20 health promoters working in different communities across the city. Our day starts with a meeting at 7.30am to resolve any major problems from the previous day and coordinate the current day’s work. The meeting is short so that by 8pm they are moving into their communities. Each health promoter supervises pairs of community health volunteers – at the moment we have 440 people passing messages about Ebola in the greater Monrovia area. So far they have spoken with more than one million people.</p> <p>My team faces angry community leaders, rumours ranging from absurd to damaging, grieving families, and the knowledge that they are working in areas where people are sick with the virus. Like the communities we work with, our protection is a strict no-contact policy and constant hand washing.</p> <p>The work is grueling and often devastating. At one point in Guinea I declared that I hated Ebola and I would never come back. But like many others, I did come back, first to Sierra Leone and now to Liberia. I came back for my colleagues who are tired, heartbroken and angry and need someone to take their place when they are too exhausted to continue.</p> <p>I came back because of the children dying alone in boxes, and for the elders who, having survived war, now watch their communities being consumed by a virus that has no cure. I came back for the patients who survive. And most of all I came back for our Guinean, Sierra Leonean, and Liberian staff who are fighting the long fight with a level of courage and compassion that exceeds anything I have ever seen. If they can keep going for months on end, then I can come back to help them.</p> <p><em>The </em><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/volunteering"><em>volunteering hub</em></a><em> is funded by Zurich Insurance.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/20/volunteered-fight-ebola-sierra-leone-msf <p>I’ve volunteered to go to west Africa because I heard that Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) was getting desperate for people.</p> <p>When I tell Mary in HR, she says she has three questions: “1) Do you know that you don’t have to go? 2) Do you know that if you get sick, we can’t guarantee we will bring you home? 3) Do you know that if you die, we can’t guarantee that we can bring your body back and you’ll be buried there?” I know MSF is famous for being straight-talking, but I’m still a bit taken aback. I answer yes to all three and go home to look for my passport. My children are unphased – “Yeah, whatever” – but promise to email.</p> <p>In Brussels, two days later, my medical briefing is entirely in French. It’s a long time since I was at school, but I get the gist: don’t shake hands, rub shoulders or brush fingertips – let alone hug, kiss or have sexual relations – with anyone. In fact, keep 1.5-2 metres away from all people at all times.</p> <p>Don’t go to markets. Don’t take public transport. And don’t EVER touch your face. By the time I board the plane I have developed a healthy paranoia. And I’m not alone. The cabin crew are wearing face masks, as are many of the passengers. When we touch down in Guinea, another 100 people push their way on. “Ah, it’s Ebola time – everyone is fleeing,” the jovial Liberian beside me says.</p> <p>Outside Sierra Leone’s Lungi airport, we wash our hands at a barrel with a tap. I learn tap etiquette: after drizzling your hands, you splash water over the tap to rinse off any Ebola germs left by the previous person. This soon becomes a 20-a-day habit – there are taps outside hotels, houses, offices, even the supermarket.<br /></p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="fb867ba26f89e6484ed8fef0b0bd742838da9246"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/20/1413806321469/3c63fe26-20a3-4361-8be7-c553e9807b7e-460x276.jpeg" alt="Inside the Ebola treatment centre, 5km outside Bo, Sierra Leone" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Inside the Ebola treatment centre, 5km outside Bo, Sierra Leone.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Natasha Lewer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>MSF’s newest Ebola treatment centre, 5km outside Bo, is white and gleaming, as incongruous as a spaceship in the surrounding bush. Two months ago it was a field of cassavas – MSF paid the farmer for his crop, then dug up the field and covered it in four enormous white tents, surrounded by brick buildings and divided by orange fencing. I’ve heard Ebola centres described as “villages of death” – six in 10 patients come out in a double body bag – so the atmosphere inside is a surprise. I arrive as three people are given the news that their second test result in a row has showed up negative, and they’re cured.</p> <p>Excited staff wait outside the concrete shower block, and one by one the survivors emerge, dripping wet and blinking in the sunlight. Everyone claps; James, a pastor turned mental health counsellor, starts to sing, and the others join in; a group of women are dancing; people take photos; everyone beams.</p>  <figure class="element element-image element--supporting" data-media-id="7509af2c942e17cf8a44bd28d1f497971f28377b"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/20/1413806021341/ad924ac6-ce87-4b86-9c08-ad147cf0789e-460x276.jpeg" alt="An Ebola survivor with a certificate of discharge" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">An Ebola survivor with a certificate of discharge.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Natasha Lewer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before they leave, the survivors ask questions. Ishmail: “Will I be able to go near my family now?” Counsellor: “I want you to go home and I want you to hug everyone in your family.” He is given a bag with blankets, bedsheets, multivitamins, packets of peanut paste to build up his strength, and a giant packet of condoms – the virus will survive in his semen for another three months. In the treatment centre, Sierra Leonean staff outnumber the international staff by 10 to one.</p> <p>All seem enthusiastic about doing their bit. In the kitchen, nine women from the local village are cooking fish and pasta for the patients’ lunch. Alusein, in a Victorian-style mob cap, finds me a pair of white wellies, size 39, decorated with stars and flowers in thick marker pen. In the stock tent, a former philosophy teacher is filling in data sheets. In the mental health tent, James is talking to the family of a patient. “As a pastor, you listen and advise; as a counsellor it’s the same thing,” he says.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="dbee1db4a2a8602200afea1e60656496f45db2b7"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/20/1413806198538/3242b027-519c-4ac8-a4a3-94acc0029f85-460x276.jpeg" alt="Rows of wellies used by volunteers fighting Ebola in Sierra Leone" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Rows of wellies used by volunteers fighting Ebola in Sierra Leone.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph:  Natasha Lewer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I’ve never met people who work so hard. The medics are reprimanded for staying too long inside the high-risk zone. Anything over an hour becomes physiologically dangerous. It’s so hot inside the layers of protective clothing that by the time you come out, you have to pour the sweat out of your boots.</p> <p>Getting togged up in 10 layers of protective clothing (scrubs, boots, yellow suit, hairnet, hood, mask, goggles, thick gloves, thin gloves, apron), and ensuring that not one millimetre of bare skin is showing, takes time and practice, but it’s nothing compared to undressing.</p> <p>When you come out of the high-risk zone you are exhausted, overheated and dehydrated; your goggles have misted over, and your mind has gone foggy. There’s a serious risk of getting contaminated as you unzip and unpeel. That’s why the sprayers are there. ”What does your job involve?” I ask. “We are the sprayers, we instruct them what to do, we stop them making mistakes, we save their lives.” They also douse you in 0.5% dilute chlorine – who needs Chanel No 5 when you can smell this sweet?</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="003acc0f07e4c151b7d7417c308f36e15884d992"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/20/1413806440811/a735491f-02b2-4051-ba7f-8fdfb194bb05-460x276.jpeg" alt="Volunteers in the Ebola treatment centre, Bo, Sierra Leone." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Volunteers in the Ebola treatment centre, Bo, Sierra Leone.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Natasha Lewer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone here is keen to do anything they can to stop the disease that’s threatening to unravel their whole society – it’s already made travel impossible, put an end to parties and funerals, closed schools and universities, made food prices rocket, and instilled suspicion and fear – of neighbours, friends and even family. “There are no gatherings or naming ceremonies, people are even scared of going to church,” MSF counsellor Tamba says. “They are afraid to do all the things that used to make them happy.”</p> <p>Mothers no longer want to bring their sick children to MSF’s paediatric hospital in case they get taken away by an alien in a spacesuit and are never seen again. As a result, many of the children only arrive when they are so ill that it’s too late to save them. No one knows how many are dying at home from malaria – the biggest killer of under-fives in this area – or from the numerous other diseases in a country with the highest rate of child deaths in the world. <br /></p> <p>Hundreds of health workers have caught Ebola and died, there are too few ambulances, too few laboratories, and there’s a very real fear that the entire health system – already weak after years of civil war – is going to collapse.</p> <p>I monitor my health minutely. Is my headache from dehydration? The sore throat from a chlorine overdose? Am I burning up with fever, or is today hotter than usual? Three symptoms at the same time and you become an Ebola suspect.</p> <p>My mother emails to suggest my children move into a rented flat in south London for 21 days when I return, while I put myself in self-imposed quarantine. I tell her there is no chance of my infecting anyone, and that I’ll be back in the office the following day. The UK is clearly caught up in Ebola paranoia too. I go out and buy a box of Sierra Leonean chocolates for my work colleagues, and wonder if I’ll get to eat them all myself.</p>

The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/18/ebola-us-travel-ban-barack-obama">arrival of the virus in America</a> has crystallised a range of Conservative anxieties: immigration, race, terrorism, science, big government, Barack Obama – you name it. For the right, Ebola is not just a disease, it is a metaphor for some of the things they don’t understand and many of the things they loathe.</p> <p>Conservative eminence grise <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2014/10/mystery-virus-found-where-illegal-alien-kids-sent/#Tpi5JI1JSAdGFyFz.99">Phyllis Schlafly believes Obama is allowing it into the country deliberately</a>. “Obama doesn’t want America to believe that we’re exceptional,” she said. “He wants us to be just like everybody else, and if Africa is suffering from Ebola, we ought to join the group and be suffering from it, too.” Rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh claims <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2014/10/15/liberals_see_ebola_through_prism_of_slavery">liberals won’t impose a travel ban from infected areas because Ebola is “payback” for slavery</a>.</p> <p>The roots of this fear-mongering are deep, and when <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/10/13/the-inevitable-rise-of-ebola-conspiracy-theories/">Ebola finally landed it fell on fertile soil</a>. First, it came from abroad – a place that many Conservatives are both afraid of and resent. Republicans are the most likely to be <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/immigration.htm">against immigration</a>, <a href="http://pollingreport.com/iraq.htm">for bombing Isis</a>, to believe that <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/12/03/public-sees-u-s-power-declining-as-support-for-global-engagement-slips/">America’s global power is declining</a>, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/28/AR2011012801651.html">to fear globalisation</a>. They’ve wanted to build a huge wall on the Mexican border for years. Ebola breaking out on the other side of the globe has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/10/from-the-right-ebola-is-the-latest-rallying-cry-for-closing-the-mexican-border/">simply added to their siege mentality</a>. “Ladies and gentlemen,” <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4510790/tillis-ebola">Republican senate candidate for North Carolina Thom Tillis said in a debate recently</a>. “We have an Ebola outbreak, we have bad actors who can come across the border. We need to seal the border and secure it.” South Carolina congressman Joe Wilson last week warned that <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/gop-congressman-hamas-might-infected-themselves-with-ebola-a#1wwy3a7">Hamas might deliberately bring Ebola sufferers into the US through Mexico illegally</a>. You couldn’t make it up; you wouldn’t know where to start. There have been three confirmed cases of Ebola in the US and none in Mexico – if anyone should be sealing the border to protect themselves from the virus it should be the Mexicans keeping Americans out.</p> <p>Second, it’s coming from Africa – a continent about which Conservatives apparently know little: while being briefed on foreign affairs during the 2008 campaign, vice-presidential candidate <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/sarah-palin/3392934/Sarah-Palin-thought-Africa-was-a-single-country-aides-claim.html">Sarah Palin asked her tutors whether “South Africa was part of the country</a>” [of Africa]? Four years later, Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney’s main rival, argued that thanks to Aids and the threat of radical Islam “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve0Jjr9EC0Q">[Africa] was a country on the brink</a>”. <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2014/10/06/dems_blame_ebola_on_gop">Limbaugh thinks Sierra Leone was founded by “British African American slaves</a>” – whoever they are. One of the reasons the government can’t ban direct flights from the infected west African countries – Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea – is because there are no direct flights from those countries to America.</p> <p>Third, Ebola makes the case for government: an institution Conservatives have no love for. It is an issue of public health to which no individual or privatised response can make any substantial, meaningful contribution. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-outbreak-in-texas-lays-bare-disjointed-government-response">To fight an epidemic like Ebola you need a well-resourced public sector</a>, well-trained government employees, central planning and coordination and a respect for science.</p> <p>Sadly, we have not seen a lot of this either from the Centers for Disease Control or the Obama administration, whose response to the outbreak has been patchy and confused. The CDC has conceded as much (very basic mistakes by the hospital in Dallas didn’t help). <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/us/amid-assurances-on-ebola-obama-is-said-to-seethe.html?_r=0">Obama is said to be seething at his team’s efforts</a>. Coming so soon after an <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/white-house-intruder-east-room">intruder made it into the White House</a>, and just a year after the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303763804579182310529141926">botched healthcare rollout</a>, his administration is getting a reputation for incompetence that only confirms the right’s conspiracy theories. Fighting Ebola doesn’t just need government; it needs competent governance.</p> <p>Fourth, it makes the case for public healthcare. <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/fund-report/2013/apr/1681_collins_insuring_future_biennial_survey_2012_final.pdf">In 2012, 43% of Americans reported not getting the medical care they needed because of costs</a>. The figure for the uninsured is far higher. Fearing high bills and long waits at emergency rooms, the uninsured generally wait to see if an ailment is really serious before seeking assistance. Imagine how likely they would be to seek immediate help for a temperature and, if they did turn out to have Ebola, how many people they might infect before they did. About <a href="http://www.texmed.org/Template.aspx?id=5519">a quarter of Texans, the state where the outbreak is centred, do not have medical insurance</a>. (That includes <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/16/west-ebola-response-black-patient">Thomas Eric Duncan, the only person to die from Ebola in the US</a>.) It would be less but Texas governor, <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/rick-perry-accepting-medicaid-expansion-like-putting-1-000-more-people-on-the-titanic">Rick Perry, refused to cooperate with the federal government to expand Medicaid</a> under the provisions of Obamacare.</p> <p>Finally, Ebola serves as a proxy for the many long-held Conservative prejudices about Obama – that he is an <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/conservatives-ebola-conspiracies">African-born interloper come to destroy America</a>. A 2010 poll showed that just under <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/02/02/832988/-The-2010-Comprehensive-Daily-Kos-Research-2000-Poll-of-Self-Identified-Republicans">a third of Republicans believed Obama was a “racist who hates white people</a>”. <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/michael-savage-obama-wants-bring-ebola-epidemic-america-should-resign">Michael Savage, another rightwing radio host, calls him “Obola</a>”. “Obama wants equality and he wants fairness, and it’s only fair that America have a nice epidemic or two … to really feel what it’s like to be in the third world. You have to look at it from the point of view of a leftist.”</p> <p>From the point of view of this leftist, what really terrifies the right about Ebola is that it shows – albeit in a deadly, scary, tragic way – that we are all connected. It shows that no matter how strong the gates around your community, how high the wall on your border, how sophisticated the alarm on your house; no matter how much you avoid state schools, public transport and public libraries; no matter how much you pay the premium to retreat from the public sphere – you cannot escape both your own humanity and the humanity of others, and the fact that our fates are tied. If you want to feel secure in Texas, regardless of your race, income or religion, it’s in your interests that people have healthcare in Monrovia.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/19/bigger-questions-around-ebola-outbreak <p>Kofi Annan is right to criticise the slow reaction by the west to the Ebola crisis (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-britain-david-cameron-ban-ki-moon" title="">Follow Britain’s example on Ebola, David Cameron tells world leaders</a>, 17 October 2014). However, I do not agree that “if the crisis had hit some other region it probably would have been handled very differently. In fact, when you look at the evolution of the crisis, the international community really woke up when the disease got to America and Europe.” Mr Annan knows very well that there would be no need for the west to help Africa fight Ebola today if most of the £550bn given to the continent as development aid since independence, had not been diverted to fund local leaders’ luxury lifestyles.</p> <p>Yet the insinuation of racism is too often used to morally blackmail western governments into taking, or not taking an action in Africa. For example, last year, the African Union passed a resolution that claimed the west was using the international criminal court (ICC) to witch-hunt African leaders.<br /><strong>Sam Akaki</strong><br /><em>Director, Democratic Institutions for Poverty Reduction in Africa (Dipra)</em></p> <p>• Sierra Leone has been a recipient of development aid for many years. The UK and US, the biggest donors, both stress that they prioritise health. Net bilateral aid from the UK in 2012 was £62m. However, reports on the effectiveness of aid from the OECD in 2010 and the UN University in 2013 make no reference to health. The capacity and resilience of the health system in the face of Ebola strongly suggests far too little progress has been made. Unless radical improvements are made to primary healthcare and basic services such as sanitation and clean water, Sierra Leone and a multitude of low and middle income countries will remain vulnerable to chronic ill health and premature mortality and epidemics. We are surely entitled to ask whether the emphasis on trade and economic development in aid is at the expense of the majority of the populations in many states. <br /><strong>Neil Blackshaw</strong><br /><em>Little Easton, Essex</em></p> <p>• We welcome the deployment of medical staff, public health specialists and even the military who are arriving to support their efforts (Report, 16 October). But we must also remember the thousands of local people who have been working flat out on this disease since the first outbreaks. They are doctors and nurses, community health workers, cleaners and those who bury the dead safely. And there are also ordinary people who have volunteered to go into villages and teach people how to protect themselves from the disease and also try to quell the panic and fear that people are understandably feeling.</p> <p>ActionAid staff and volunteers have been doing this job here in Liberia and in Sierra Leone, as well as going into quarantined areas to provide emergency food rations to those who are not allowed to harvest their crops or go to market to buy food. So, yes we need funds for medical treatment, but let’s not forget, to cut this outbreak off at the source requires a holistic approach involving medical intervention, prevention campaigns and practical aid for those affected, which is centred around community mobilisation.<br /><strong>Ms Korto Williams</strong><br /><em>Country Director, ActionAid Liberia</em></p> <p>• US secretary of state John Kerry speaks of the Ebola “scourge” as comparable with HIV (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/18/ebola-risk-john-kerry-we-must-not-kid-ourselves-video" title="">Report</a>, 18 October). I was a clinical nurse specialist working with people with HIV/Aids three decades ago when HIV was first identified. At the time there was ignorance and fear about “a disease of dark origin” coming out of Africa and seen as a threat to the west. Now we face a similar situation with Ebola; it is forgotten that Sierra Leone has the world’s highest mortality rate for malaria, in excess of Ebola figures. Malaria kills 130/100,000 of its population. How much does the west express concern and demand action? Oh, I forgot: malaria has zero rates in these countries.<br /><strong>Denis Cobell</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>• What are your human rights during quarantine? It is clear that the right to free movement and enjoying family life is restricted for public safety needs. People will be locked away to ensure our wellbeing. We do have a responsibility for their care. Do we have enough secure rooms or will we use prisons? How can we guarantee everybody is treated with respect? Who is responsible for people’s wellbeing during the two months lasting quarantine? Rents? There will be a need for psychological support.</p> <p>I once was wrongly quarantined for swine flu and something as ordinary as pneumonia was missed in the hysteria, and nearly treated too late. This time, some people with temperatures coming from Africa might be misdiagnosed too. We need compassion for the infected, the NHS staff but also the innocently quarantined. We should not let hysteria dictate our treatment of potential infected people but focus on public health measures that are properly thought through. <br /><strong>Julia Thrul</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>• While the Hong Kong government has been in the news for all the wrong reasons recently (Letters, passim), preventative health measures initiated there during the Sars crisis of 2003 when Dr Margaret Chan, the current head of the WHO, was director of health, included the obligation for lift buttons, door handles etc in public buildings to be disinfected many times a day. These measures are still in force, as is the obligation for all passengers arriving at the international airport to walk through thermal imaging fever-scanners. Border control points between Hong Kong and mainland China also implement disease prevention and control measures. These are not fail-safe measures by any means, but at times of crisis like the current Ebola outbreak, such actions most certainly help educate the public about how diseases can spread, and how individuals can monitor their habits to help prevent further rapid spreading. <br /><strong>Paul Tattam</strong><br /><em>Teignmouth, Devon</em></p> <p>• After the screening confusion at Heathrow (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ebola-screening-confusion-heathhrow-airport-measures" title="">Report</a>, 14 October), perhaps the UK could seek advice from Nicaragua. I passed through Managua airport on Monday en route from Houston, stood in line with everyone else to have my temperature checked, and today received a precautionary follow-up visit from a doctor. Nicaragua’s national health budget, by the way, is less than a typical NHS trust.<br /><strong>John Perry</strong><br /><em>Masaya, Nicaragua</em></p> <p>• I see travellers are being checked for symptoms of Ebola at departure points in affected countries. A further precaution would be to advise the public against unnecessary international travel for the time being. This would buy time for doctors to contain the virus at source. <br /><strong>Susan Roberts</strong><br /><em>Sterrebeek, Belgium</em></p> <p>• Is fear of Ebola on aeroplanes the spur to video-conferencing that businesses have been long waiting for?<br /><strong>Godfrey H. Holmes</strong><br /><em>Withernsea, East Riding </em></p> <p>• For any infective disease, the basic reproduction rate is the number of new cases produced by a single case in a susceptible (ie unvaccinated) population (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/17/downing-street-ebola-panic-politics-of-fear-sars-bird-flu" title="">Simon Jenkins</a>, 17 October). If the figure is less than 1, the infection will die out. If greater than 1, an epidemic can result. With Ebola the rate is just above 1.5, which means that every two cases produce three more. That is the basis for the WHO prediction that new cases in West Africa will double every month. Without an effective vaccine, the disease will become progressively more difficult to control as the number of cases increase, and unless quarantine measures are introduced, spread to the rest of the world seems inevitable.<br /><strong>Dr Robin Russell-Jones </strong><br /><em>Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire </em></p> <p>• Simon Jenkins is right to inveigh against the habit of politicians keeping the populace in a state of fear. The tragedy is that this epidemic could have been nipped in the bud months ago if governments had paid heed to organisations such as Medecins sans Frontières whose newsletters portrayed the horror of the situation in unemotional terms. The cutting of the WHO budget and aid to the health systems of West Africa by the World Bank and others is now revealed as the grossest false economy, for which we will all pay dearly in terms of both human misery and money.<br /><strong>Dr John Hurdley</strong><br /><em>Birmingham</em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/19/ted-cruz-attacks-white-house-doctors-ebola <p>Scientists and politicians clashed over the US response to Ebola on Sunday, as all-clears given to Texas healthcare workers and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/19/ebola-cruise-ship-returns-texas-woman-quarantine">a cruise ship passenger</a> potentially exposed to the disease failed to quell continued public unease.<br /></p> <p>One man <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan">has died from Ebola in the US</a>; two nurses who treated him at a Texas hospital have <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/ebola-texas-healthcare-worker-virus">contracted the disease</a>.</p> <p>More than 4,500 people are believed to have died in the three west African countries worst hit by the Ebola epidemic: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.<br /></p> <p>On Sunday afternoon, the Department of Defense announced the formation of “a 30-person expeditionary medical support team” made up of 20 critical-care nurses, five doctors “trained in infectious disease” and five trainers in infectious disease protocols. The team will only operate, if needed, within the US.</p> <p>With just two weeks to go until closely fought midterm elections, the Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz stepped up his criticism of White House policy against travel restrictions, calling for extra border guards and dismissing the administration’s argument that medical advice showed quarantines and travel bans would be counter-productive.</p> <p>“The doctors making this argument are working for the administration and repeating their talking points,” said Cruz, a potential candidate for the presidency in 2016, in an interview on CNN. “The arguments they are giving don’t make sense.”</p> <p>Cruz’s criticism was immediately rejected by one of the administration’s top scientific advisers, who stressed that revised public health protocols were more than sufficient to contain future transmission and designed to “shave off risk”.</p> <p>“I have never had an experience where the president is telling me to tell him something he wants to hear,” said <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/directors/biography/pages/biography.aspx">Dr Anthony Fauci</a> of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on CNN in response to the Texas senator.</p> <p>“There is no such thing as zero risk but when you get into relative risk, the chances [of transmission in the general US public] if not zero, are so vanishingly low that there are lots of other things you should worry about.”<br /></p> <p>The Pentagon said its new medical support team, which will train at Fort Sam Houston in Texas, will only be deployed to provide “short-notice assistance to civilian medical professionals”.<br /></p> <p>Officials do acknowledge that there is a tension between demonstrating such “abundance of caution” needed to reassure the public over Ebola and causing more anxiety by overreacting. This was demonstrated vividly on Sunday as a cruise ship at the centre of a high-profile Ebola scare <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/19/ebola-cruise-ship-returns-texas-woman-quarantine">returned to port in Galveston, Texas</a>, having been prevented from docking in Mexico and Belize, only to have all tests for the disease on board prove negative.</p> <p>A lab worker from the Dallas hospital who may have handled specimens collected from the first person to be given a diagnosis of Ebola in the US, Thomas Eric Duncan, went into voluntary quarantine in her cabin along with her husband last Wednesday after the cruise operator was told by federal authorities that she was on board and tighter travel protocols were being introduced.<br /><br />The woman had already been self-monitoring, taking her temperature daily for fever signs, but isolated herself and stepped up her health checks after concern grew last week that the hospital’s procedures had been inadequate and news broke that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/ebola-second-texas-nurse-transferred-atlanta">the second nurse to test positive</a> for the virus <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/oct/16/ebola-outbreak-texas-hospital-apologises-over-infections-as-uk-army-medics-travel-to-sierra-leone-live-updates">had taken a commercial flight</a> the day before developing a high fever.</p> <p>The cruise ship incident underlines how more stringent responses now in place come with an added risk of generating fear: some offices and facilities, such as a Pentagon car park, have been closed down for something as limited as a recent traveller to west Africa vomiting in public.</p> <p>Fauci questioned whether the response to the cruise ship incident was medically necessary, but argued that such caution in evidence in recent days was important for reassuring the US public.</p> <p>“You can understand why it was done,” he said. “Fear is something that needs to be respected.”</p> <p>Nevertheless, the end of a 21-day incubation time limit on Sunday for some of the healthcare workers exposed to Duncan when he first attended a hospital in Dallas provided increased hope that transmission to other nurses and medical staff will be limited.</p> <p>This in turn appears to be leading to a calmer message from the administration, with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/18/ebola-us-travel-ban-barack-obama">President Obama warning of the risks of hysteria on Saturday</a> and Dr Fauci – a seasoned public health expert and veteran of the Aids epidemic – leading a robust response across five Sunday morning political talkshows.</p> <p>Recently, the administration’s response has been split among a number of experts, such as Dr Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Friday, Obama appointed political adviser <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-czar-white-house-outbreak-ron-klain">Ron Klain</a> as a single government coordinator, or “Ebola czar”.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Republican critics argue the White House remains overly focused on message and say the administration, not them, is playing politics with Ebola.</p> <p>“We should be less concerned about giving the public the feeling that the government is on top of this and more concerned about making sure that the government is on top of this,” said Cruz.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/19/ebola-cruise-ship-returns-texas-woman-quarantine <p>Holidaymakers often feel regret at the end of a vacation, but the prevailing sentiment was more like relief among many of the passengers who stepped off the Carnival Magic after an Ebola scare prompted a tense climax to their cruise.</p> <p>The ship docked as normal in Galveston early on Sunday after a seven-day journey through the Gulf of Mexico. But the past few days were anything but ordinary for those on board, especially for one couple.</p> <p>A lab worker from the Dallas hospital who may have handled specimens collected from the first person to be given a diagnosis of Ebola in the US, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan">Thomas Eric Duncan</a>, went into voluntary quarantine in her cabin along with her husband last Wednesday, after the cruise operator was told by federal authorities that she was on board and tighter travel protocols were being introduced.</p> <p>On Sunday, one woman who had just disembarked blamed the media for the sense of unease that subsequently enveloped the cruise. </p> <p>“Y’all blew it out of proportion,” said the woman, who refused to give her name. “All you had to do is stay out of it and there wouldn’t have been a problem but y’all blew it out of proportion. My family were scared to death because they were watching the news.”</p> <p>The lab worker had already been self-monitoring, taking her temperature daily for fever signs, but she isolated herself and stepped up her health checks after concern grew last week that the hospital’s procedures had been inadequate and news broke that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/ebola-second-texas-nurse-transferred-atlanta">the second nurse to test positive</a> for the virus <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/oct/16/ebola-outbreak-texas-hospital-apologises-over-infections-as-uk-army-medics-travel-to-sierra-leone-live-updates">had taken a commercial flight</a> the day before developing a high fever. </p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) issued <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/air/managing-sick-travelers/ebola-guidance-airlines.html">updated air travel guidelines</a> last week.</p> <p>When the Magic’s passengers heard an on-board announcement explaining the woman’s situation, it set them wondering who she was, where she was and whether they had bumped into her. There were 4,100 passengers and 1,400 crew, conjuring nightmare worst-case scenarios of mass infection in a confined space.</p> <p>Despite officials emphasising that the woman was very low-risk and was not symptomatic, and so not contagious, some passengers grew worried and the ship’s itinerary was forcibly altered. The Belize government refused State Department entreaties to let the couple disembark in the country so they could be flown home, while Mexican authorities in Cozumel did not allow the ship to dock for a scheduled daylong stop.</p> <p>Passengers exiting on Sunday were given a two-sided A4 sheet with facts about Ebola taken from the CDC website and “seven things to know” about the passenger. It said that her risk period of 21 days after potential exposure would be over on Monday, when if she continued to show no symptoms she would not require active monitoring.</p> <p>“While the cruise was ongoing, your fellow passenger’s requirements for monitoring their health changed after a fellow hospital employee became ill with Ebola and extra cautions were extended,” the sheet said. “Currently, public health officials are not recommending you take any additional actions. We apologise for the disruption this has caused to your vacation.”</p> <p>With the threat so small, the main effect of the incident has been to underline how the virus has disproportionately spread fear among the public. It also demonstrates the considerable efforts government officials and transport companies are making to prevent panic in the wake of serious missteps in Dallas related to Duncan and the subsequent infections of two nurses who treated him before he died.</p> <p>Carnival offered each passenger $200 in ship account credit in compensation and a discount on their next cruise. </p> <p>“We had a blast,” said Brett Reich, who was getting on a shuttle bus in front of the ship as he prepared to return home to Tulsa, Oklahoma, with his family. “For us, when they said, ‘We’re sorry we’re going to cancel this call, we’re going to give you guys this much money and a discount on the next cruise,’ we were like, ‘Yes! Yes! We just got $800 plus we’re getting a discount on a cruise we’re already going to book anyway.’ So we were thrilled. </p> <p>“There are going to be people who are going to come through here who are going to be very upset. They’re at Guest Services, they’re very upset. A guy was slamming his hand on the desk … but for us, we were thrilled.”<br /><br />A couple in line for a bus, who declined to give their names, were less delighted. “They treated us well,” the man said. “Just not a good way to start our first cruise.” </p> <p>“And our last,” his partner added.</p> <p>Luggage in hand, a husband and wife were preparing to make the long trip home to Artesia, New Mexico. They praised the way the ship’s authorities handled the situation. The company has recent experience in crisis management following events in Feburary 2013, when <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/14/carnival-triumph-cruise-liner-toilets-overflowing">the Carnival Triumph was adrift for days in the Gulf of Mexico</a>, after an engine fire knocked out power and passengers claimed that human waste was piled in bags outside cabins when toilets stopped working.<br /><br />“You’re kind of a little on edge. You try not to be but, yeah, it was a little nerve-racking,” said Vicky Olivas, 45. She said that the news made some people more cautious around strangers and created an atmosphere of uncertainty.</p> <p>“We had no worries about it, them guys had everything under control,” said Jaime Olivas, 47. “They had them poor guys working and women cleaning every single inch of that boat, sanitising from top to bottom. They did an awesome job, really, the guys and workers.”</p> <p>He blamed the woman for taking the cruise in the first place. “People like her shouldn’t be on that boat at all,” he said. “If I had that, I would stay at home or in the hospital until I’m 100% clear. Why am I going to get other people infected with that, you know?

She was escorted off by local officials who drove her to a parking lot. </p> <p>“She walked off the gangway, got into a car, drove to her car, then is driving back to Dallas with her husband,” he said.</p> <p>The ship is scheduled to depart later on Sunday for a voyage to Jamaica, Grand Cayman and Cozumel, he said, but the woman’s cabin will not be used this week.</p> <p>“We took it out of service for this cruise but we’re going to do a complete sanitisation of that,” he said.</p> <p>“We technically wouldn’t need to do anything more with the vessel than we would normally need to do to turn the ship around for its next cruise but to be very cautious and provide additional peace of mind for our guests we’re doing a full sanitation of the ship so we brought in industrial foggers, we put disinfecting agent into it that fogs all the public areas and then we’ll wipe down all the surface areas – everything from doorknobs, guardrails, casino chips.”</p> <p>Berra said that even before the cruise Carnival had a screening process in place to identify potential Ebola carriers, in the form of a questionnaire which asked passengers if they had visited the affected countries in west Africa or come into contact with someone who had. Anyone who answered yes would be subjected to additional screening by a medical professional.</p> <p>“That screening has now been expanded to include, ‘Have you been potentially exposed to the Ebola virus?’,” Berra said. “But we’ve followed the rules in terms of what was established in terms of protocols with CDCand other health organisations. At the time she was completely free and clear to sail.”</p> <p>Galveston, a port and resort city on an island 50 miles from Houston, had a more concrete Ebola encounter earlier this weekend. The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in the city is home to the National Biocontainment Training Center; state officials have asked UTMB to be prepared to dispose of Ebola-related waste and provide clinical care for Ebola patients if necessary.</p> <p>The Galveston Daily News reported that on Saturday a truck with 100 barrels of medical waste from the Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas, including items such as blankets and gloves that came into contact with Duncan, arrived to be incinerated only a mile from the wharf where passengers stepped off the hulking white ship a day later. </p> <p>They were greeted by family, taxis, shuttle buses and a throng of reporters and cameras.<br /></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/19/ebola-spanish-nurse-recovery <p>Teresa Romero, the Spanish nursing auxiliary who earlier this month became the first person to contract Ebola in Europe, is making “giant steps” towards recovery, according to hospital sources in Madrid.</p> <p>Yesterday she got out of bed for the first time since she was admitted. Staff said she was animated. Her appetite had improved to the point that she was demanding “jamón and chorizo”.</p> <p>Although still wearing an oxygen mask, Romero’s left lung was said to be functioning “at 100%” and her viral load is continuing to fall. She is having a third test for Ebola today and doctors predict that on Monday morning they will announce that she has tested negative for the disease.</p> <p>Madrid health authorities have claimed that Romero contracted the disease after touching the face of the Spanish missionary she was treating. However, yesterday she said that she had no memory of this. “If something like that had happened I would have told you,” she is reported to have told her husband.</p> <p>Romero is being treated with a combination of serum made up of antibodies extracted from Ebola survivors and anti-viral drugs. “They are complementary treatments,” Juan García de Lomas, head of microbiology at the Hospital Clinic in Valencia explained.</p> <p>However, experts warn that the antiviral is experimental and has only been tested on mice. The possible side-effects on humans are not known.</p> <p>Until now Romero has been unaware that she has become a household name, with her picture on front pages and websites around the world and camera crews camped outside the hospital. Her family says she has been “in a cloud” and was initially so heavily medicated she found it difficult to hold a conversation. She still doesn’t know that the family dog, Excalibur, was put down by the health authorities.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/19/will-pooley-ebola-returns-to-sierra-leone <p>The British nurse who survived Ebola has flown back to Sierra Leone expressing fears that the world will return to indifference about the plight of Africans when the crisis abates.</p> <p>Will Pooley is expected to touch down in Freetown on Sunday evening and will resume work on Monday in an Ebola isolation unit run by a team backed by three NHS trusts and a London university.</p> <p>He said he “can’t see anything changing” in attitudes towards Africa, where diseases such as malaria have already killed 70 times more people than Ebola this year.</p> <p>The Suffolk-born nurse said it had been an easy decision to return despite the worries of his family and friends. He has said he cannot stand “idly by” and watch more die. “I chose to go before and it was the right thing to do then and it’s still the right thing to do now.”</p> <p>Although it is widely assumed that a person cannot contract Ebola twice, this is not scientifically proven and Pooley has been warned that he still faces a risk. “They have told me I very likely have immunity, at least for the near future, to this strain of Ebola. I have also been told it’s a possibility that I don’t, so I will just have to act as if I don’t,” he told the Guardian.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-16551d81-6cc4-4cd2-9e01-94aed8fddbba"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/19/1413711796520/3a89f3cc-8f87-46eb-98d5-cfa47ff3da20-460x276.jpeg" alt="Will Pooley in Sierra Leone with local people who have also recovered from Ebola.

Before leaving he demonstrated typical selflessness, banking 1.2 litres of plasma in a lab in Birmingham to help WHO research on a “convalescent plasma therapy”.</p> <p>“Some of it might be used for research and consent has been given. It may be possible to use it for any future patients,” he said. Pooley has also had white blood cells harvested for research. Last month he flew to the US where he gave a further three litres over six days.</p> <p>While on the ward at the Connaught hospital in Sierra Leone’s capital, Freetown, he will wear full personal protective equipment, including mask, goggles and special overalls. “You’re going to get the virus on yourself and you need to dispose of that virus safely. You couldn’t walk into the ward in your own clothes. You might be exposed to the virus and then walk out of the ward and potentially other people wold be exposed too,” he said.</p> <p>He is joining a 10-strong team working with King’s Health Partners, a partnership between King’s College London and three London NHS trusts: Guys and St Thomas’, King’s College hospital, and South London and Maudsley. “I’m excited to get back out there. I want to get back to work,” he said.</p> <p>The Kings team, headed by British doctor Oliver Johnson, has been at the Connaught since 2013 working on health infrastructure. When the Ebola virus hit in May, it swung operations around to help contain the outbreak. As it went out of control, Johnson worked with the government to set up an Ebola command centre in the capital.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-26425e44-80d5-4e17-a1e7-7d1120c76723"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/19/1413711838026/1e8db8e3-1294-4556-9308-f09749e02261-460x276.jpeg" alt="pooley1" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">William Pooley in full PPE in a quarantine area in Sierra Leone.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Michael Duff /Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It’s fantastic that Will has chosen to join our small team … The situation here in Freetown is getting worse by the day,” said Johnson. “Will’s experience and commitment will be vital as we do everything we can to flow the stem of cases.”</p> <p>When Pooley was airlifted from Sierra Leone on 25 August Ebola had already killed 1,400. The situation has rapidly deteriorated since and the death toll now eclipses 4,500. As the crisis intensifies in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the WHO has warned Ebola could be infecting as many as 10,000 people a week by December.</p> <p>Pooley said he understood the concern about an outbreak in Britain or America but urged the public to donate money to fight the “real problem” in west Africa.</p> <p>“The risk of a really damaging outbreak here [in the UK] is negligible. There’s an absolute catastrophe happening in another part of the world, so really that should be our focus,” he said.</p> <p>But as the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/world-health-organisation-botched-ebola-outbreak" title="">WHO admitted it had mishandled the early stages of the outbreak</a>, Pooley said he was pessimistic about attitudes. “I can’t really see anything changing, maybe we will get involved in the Ebola response, but after it’s over things will go back to how they’ve always been,” he said. “It’s a total shame we’re ignoring all this death going on not too far away, but it’s always been the case. It always will be.</p> <p>“Take malaria: there are hundreds of thousands dying of malaria in Africa every year and it would be an outrage if it happened here, but because it’s happening there, people don’t mind. I think it’s terrible but it’s just how it is.”</p> <p>He urged the media to increase efforts to go to the afflicted countries and “send pictures back” to make the public aware of “just how bad things are and the suffering the disease is causing”. He hoped this would put pressure on governments to get more involved.</p> <p>He also urged more doctors and nurses to volunteer. Pooley said it was disappointing to see “wrangles over trying to get the NHS staff to help”, with the government initially rejecting calls to release staff. “Maybe in the future there’ll be a more sympathetic [attitude] towards the amazing experience healthcare workers can gain by working in Africa and the amazing good they can do.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/19/ebola-liberia-death-toll-data-sorious-samura <p>The true death toll from the Ebola epidemic is being masked by chaotic data collection and people’s reluctance to admit that their loved ones had the virus, according to one of west Africa’s most celebrated film-makers.</p> <p>Sorious Samura, who has just returned from making a documentary on the crisis in Liberia, said it is very clear on the ground that the true number of dead is far higher than the official figures being reported by the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>Liberia accounts for more than half of all the official Ebola deaths, with a total of 2,458. Overall, the number of dead across Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea has exceeded 4,500.</p> <p>Samura, a television journalist originally from Sierra Leone, said the Liberian authorities appeared to be deliberately downplaying the true number of cases, for fear of increasing alarm in the west African country.</p> <p>“People are dying in greater numbers than we know, according to MSF [Médecins sans Frontières] and WHO officials. Certain departments are refusing to give them the figures – because the lower it is, the more peace of mind they can give people. The truth is that it is still not under control.”</p> <p>WHO has admitted that problems with data-gathering make it hard to track the evolution of the epidemic, with the number of cases in the capital, Monrovia, going under-reported. Efforts to count freshly dug graves had been abandoned.</p> <p>Local culture is also distorting the figures. Traditional burial rites involve relatives touching the body – a practice that can spread Ebola – so the Liberian government has ruled that Ebola victims must be cremated.</p> <p>“They don’t like this burning of bodies,” said Samura, whose film <a href="http://pr.aljazeera.com/post/101918748535/suspicion-anger-and-fear-the-harsh-reality-of-daily"><em>Living with Ebola </em>premieres on 12 November on Al Jazeera English</a>. “Before the government gets there they will have buried their loved ones and broken all the rules.”</p> <p>Kim West of MSF admitted that calculating deaths was “virtually impossible”, adding that only when retrospective surveys were conducted would the true figure be known.</p> <p>Samura believes sexual promiscuity among westerners could play a role in the virus’s spread abroad. Almost immediately after the outbreak was reported in March, Liberia’s health minister warned people to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26825869">stop having sex </a>because the virus was spread via bodily fluids as well as kissing.“I saw westerners in nightclubs, on beaches, guys picking up prostitutes,” he said. “Westerners who ought to know better are going to nightclubs and partying and dancing. It beggars belief.It’s scary.”</p> <p>He said another striking feature was that the ineffectiveness of years of aid had been laid bare: “Money has poured in from the west, but it has gone to waste. Ebola should make us think about how the west gives aid to Africa; aid has not been used to create a system able to cope with this challenge. Ebola has exposed the fact it is not working. That money has gone to waste.”</p> <p>A committee of MPs recently criticised the Department for International Development and the EU for failing to address the problem of aid being misappropriated. It said just £2.4m of £37m of aid had actually made its way to Liberia’s health ministry.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/19/ebola-and-failing-markets-we-must-work-together <p>Last week, the world’s stock and bond markets swung wildly. They worried about the threat of world deflation, falling oil prices and further systemic weaknesses in the financial system. But perhaps they were most concerned about whether spooked governments had the will to do anything, even if those governments could agree on what that should be. If they can’t manage a co-ordinated response to Ebola or one against the cruelties of Isis, then it is hardly likely they are going to find common ground in managing the fissures in the world economy.</p> <p>It is not as though there is not the beginning of a policy and intellectual consensus about what is wrong. Inequality is increasingly understood to be poisoning everything; governments cannot continue with business as usual policies; interdependencies have to be recognised and acted on. The problem is doing any of it.</p> <p>Thus only last week, Janet Yellen, chair of the US Federal Reserve, joined one of her predecessors, Alan Greenspan, and the governor of the Bank of England, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney" title="">Mark Carney</a>, in arguing that the growth of inequality was not only <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/oct/17/federal-reserve-chair-janet-yellen-inequality-gap-rich-poor" title="">wrong morally</a> but having increasingly baleful economic consequences. Then there were the strictures of the managing director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde.</p> <p>Inequality, they all say, fosters fear, creates too much demand for credit to compensate for squeezed living standards, drives asset price bubbles, catalyses financial instability, weakens banks and, by displacing too much risk on to those who cannot bear it, undermines the legitimacy of capitalism. You have to blink with incredulity – and then blink again at markets falling because they want to see purposeful government action.</p> <p>But governments everywhere seem paralysed, relying on central bankers’ promises not to raise interest rates to keep everyone calm and buy time for a few more months. No electoral majority can be mustered for even common sense, centrist radicalism that might address inequality or put economies stricken by the legacy of too much private debt and low demand back on their feet. They are stymied by their terror of going beyond the comfort zone of business as usual, as if the world had not changed after the financial crisis. It demands thinking – and doing – the hitherto unthinkable. Austerity remains the conventional wisdom.</p> <p>In any case, rightwing populists challenge any such imaginative action as wrong. It’s not the aftermath of the financial crisis that’s the problem for them. It is foreigners, immigrants and the EU. We don’t need to look out for others, act purposefully to reshape our economies to lower inequality or accept interdependencies, declaim the world’s Nigel Farages. We are going to look out for number one, lock out foreigners and the rest of the world will meekly accept our assertion of self-interest.</p> <p>This incubus goes far beyond economics. Thus the Ebola crisis has been gathering force for over a year. But it has taken the prospect of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/who-new-ebola-cases-world-health-organisation" title="">10,000 new cases a week</a> by December in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea for it to become a global threat. It’s taken this to shock world governments into a response that even now is grudging and inadequate. To stem the epidemic, burials have to be safe and more than 70% of new sufferers immediately isolated, but for that there has to be a vast expansion of the health infrastructure, along with thousands of doctors and nurses.</p> <p>West Africa has neither, nor is any crash mobilisation yet in prospect. Governments have been more preoccupied with stopping cases arriving in Europe, Japan and the US than getting involved in the messy and expensive business of tackling Africa’s health inequalities, the root of the epidemic. Only in the past week has there been some movement, with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/18/ebola-scourge-hiv-john-kerry" title="">Britain committing £125m to Sierra Leone</a> and others beginning to make common cause. But only <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/16/uk-health-ebola-un-idUKKCN0I51XO20141016" title="">$100,000 of the $1bn UN fund</a> has been subscribed. The reality of interdependence, even before a global epidemic, is hard to accept.</p> <p>If this is hard, it is much harder to accept the interdependency of global finance and beyond that the interdependencies of whole societies such as our own. Nobody is dying a horrible death. But it is very striking how difficult it is to convince the financial, political and intellectual elite that what happened in 2008/9 changed everything. For a generation, western societies in general, and Britain in particular, relied on the massive growth of private credit to mask the dysfunctionality of their capitalism. There was too little attention paid to ensuring the mass of people had economic opportunity in businesses that invested, innovated and grew. The assumption became rooted that the state was the problem and that business and markets would provide, which they could as long as private debt levels doubled every 20 years.</p> <p>What is so chilling about George Osborne’s approach to running the economy is that he really believes he can go back to those times. So do Republicans in the US and so in her way does Angela Merkel. As Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator of the <em>FT</em>, writes in his magisterial account of today’s global economy, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/02/shifts-and-the-shocks-martin-wolf-review-financial-crisis" title=""><em>The Shifts and the Shocks</em></a>, the elites have not been disabused of the notion that global finance can continue as before. The vast overhang of private debt <em>is</em> depressive, he argues. Governments must spend and borrow more for perhaps another decade. Central banks must continue with extraordinary monetary policies. Banks and banking need wholesale reform. Deflation, not inflation, is the threat.</p> <p>Wolf applauds the world’s governments for acting so positively for 18 months after the crisis – and lambasts them for thinking all was well too soon and cutting spending when the co-dependency of state and market and need for extraordinary measures have never been more apparent. The result is self-defeating secular stagnation threatening to topple into worse – in essence, this is what spooked the markets last week.</p> <p>Finance needs further reshaping; we need purposeful action to lower inequality, which will involve raising taxes on the wealthy, while governments have to borrow and spend, with infrastructure spending being an easy win. Parallel policies are needed abroad.</p> <p>Europe or foreigners are not the cause of our ills. Ukip and the Tory right will make things worse, not better. Just as the best in the world can see what needs to happen in West Africa, so the best are dissociating themselves from the prescriptions of the right. Nigel Farage and the British right have to be understood for what they are: the political equivalent of Ebola – a virus that threatens our economic and social health.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/18/texas-ebola-hospital-presbyproud-fightback-criticism <p>The hospital in Texas where two nurses became the first people <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-infected-nurse-stable-condition-specialist-maryland-hospital">to contract Ebola inside the US</a> is mounting an aggressive public relations campaign to rescue its image, as nursing representatives call for its top executives to be held accountable for the crisis.</p> <p>Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas hired <a href="http://www.burson-marsteller.com/who-we-are/about-us/">Burson-Marsteller</a>, a New York-based PR firm, to direct a fightback against sharp criticism it received after Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who was first sent home by the hospital, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan">died there from Ebola</a>.</p> <p>It has since published slick video clips of smiling nurses praising their managers and hosted a brief “rally” of medics wielding pro-hospital placards outside the emergency room for television news cameras. Amid fears patients might stay away, the hospital has tried to flood social media with the hashtag “<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PresbyProud&amp;src=typd">#PresbyProud</a>” and issued rebuttals to allegations about its practices after nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson were infected while treating Duncan, who died on 8 October.</p> <p>“We did everything we could within our power to treat that patient, because he was our priority,” a nurse identified as Josh said in an official video clip that was <a href="http://youtu.be/9HsRQoyezsk">published to YouTube</a> on Saturday afternoon. “I’m proud of my nurses and their heroic efforts”.</p> <p>Three previous clips each asked Presbyterian nurses whether they felt safe at work. “I feel that I do work in a safe environment,” said Sean Faulkner. “I feel we do have the opportunity to be trained on new safety devices and new safety protocols.”</p> <p>Another nurse, Thao, said she and her colleagues “know the protocols and what to do in the event of a disaster”.</p> <p>Such remarks responded directly to stinging <a href="http://www.nationalnursesunited.org/blog/entry/statement-by-registered-nurses-at-texas-health-presbyterian-hospital-in-dal/">allegations made by National Nurses United</a>, a union that said some nurses at the hospital had been moved to blow the whistle about inadequate protections of them and other patients during the treatment of Duncan. </p> <p>“Were protocols breached?” asked the union, in a statement. “The nurses say there were no protocols.”</p> <p>In a series of statements of its own, the hospital sharply disputed several of the allegations. <a href="http://texashealth.org/body.cfm?id=1629&amp;action=detail&amp;ref=1901">One alleged</a> that “third parties who don’t know our hospital, our employees and who were not present when the events occurred are seeking to exploit a national crisis by inserting themselves into an already challenging situation”.</p> <p>Deborah Burger, co-president of National Nurses United, told the Guardian she stood by the nurses’ claims. </p> <p>“If the hospital had been providing personal protection equipment, and were following the proper guidelines to protect the patients, the community and the healthcare workers, we would not have had two nurses who came down with Ebola from one facility,” she said.</p> <p>Burger said nurses had told of a terrible scene in an anteroom next to the isolation room where Duncan was suffering from projectile vomiting and extreme diarrhoea, in which “every single piece of equipment the nurses wore, every piece of paper, every piece of bed linen did not go out” and accumulated because there was no adequate plan for dealing with it. </p> <p>“Virus-infected stuff was piling up there,” she said. “It was a reservoir.” </p> <p>Texas Health said in a statement that it went “above and beyond” national guidelines on waste.</p> <p>Late on Friday afternoon, a few dozen nurses and other staff appeared to abruptly exit the hospital building to stage a brief rally outside. Some held placards, bearing slogans such as “We [heart] Presby” and “We stand with Presby”, which appeared to have been written in the same handwriting.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/texashealth/statuses/523263705731985408">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Nurses at Texas Health Dallas pray for patients, one another today at hospital gathering. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/presbyproud?src=hash">#presbyproud</a> <a href="http://t.co/BdnED3VEBe">pic.twitter.com/BdnED3VEBe</a></p>&mdash; TexasHealthResources (@texashealth) <a href="https://twitter.com/texashealth/status/523263705731985408">October 18, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Local TV news broadcasters were tipped off about the event. A news helicopter hovered above, capturing footage for evening bulletins, while cameras on the ground filmed from some distance away. No interviews of the participants appeared to take place, and the event ended in about half an hour. </p> <p>A photograph of nurses at the gathering holding hands and praying was <a href="https://twitter.com/texashealth/status/523263705731985408">posted to the Twitter account of Texas Health Resources</a>, the hospital’s operator. Calls to discuss the event with hospital spokespeople were not returned.</p> <p>The hospital had by then begun to win sympathetic media coverage by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e8DXyVc7Lw">publishing to YouTube on Thursday night</a> some extraordinary video footage of Pham, which was recorded at her bedside before she was transferred to a National Institutes of Health facility in Maryland. “I love you guys,” she was shown telling her hazmat-suited doctors.</p> <p>An accompanying statement that Pham was said to have “asked the hospital to release” while her condition steadily worsened, said she appreciated “everything that my co-workers have done to care for me,” and added: “I’m doing really well thanks to this team, which is the best in the world. I believe in my talented co-workers. I am #PresbyProud!”</p> <p>A search on Twitter for that hashtag – reminiscent of slogans such as “Boston Strong” and “I Love Ferguson” that have proliferated in US cities suffering through no fault of their own – shows that among the few people using it are the Texas Health corporate account, Brent Boulding, a public relations executive for Texas Health, and Ted Shaw, the chief executive of the Texas Hospitals Association lobbying organisation. </p> <p>“It makes it seem less of a grassroots effort among the staff and more of what sometimes is referred to as an astroturf campaign to look like grassroots,” said Mark Graban, a Texas-based healthcare consultant. “People should be supportive of the nurses and individuals who performed heroically, but the hospital itself failed.”</p>  <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HsRQoyezsk"                                                                                > <iframe width="460" height="259" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HsRQoyezsk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Texas Health has indeed conceded that it made errors. The line its staff are required to take appears to be that bosses acknowledge that they “made mistakes” and are “deeply sorry”. Those phrases were used both by Dr Daniel Varga, the chief clinical officer, in his written testimony to the US Congress on Thursday afternoon, and in a <a href="http://texashealth.org/body.cfm?id=1629&amp;action=detail&amp;ref=1901">statement issued by the hospital operator that evening</a>.</p> <p>Yet notably absent from public view during this period of intense, international attention have been the <a href="http://www.texashealth.org/body.cfm?id=829">hospital’s three most senior executives</a>, including its acting president, Jim Berg, who rose to the position only in August this year, when his predecessor, Britt Berrett, who was paid more than $1.2m a year, left after four years to teach at the University of Texas in Dallas.</p> <p>Equally shielded from public scrutiny has been Cole Edmonson, who as Dallas Presbyterian’s chief nursing officer is the senior manager to both Pham and Vinson. Edmonson, who according to the hospital’s latest tax filing is paid more than $410,000 a year, owns three homes and a boat in Texas, according to public records. In 2012 he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqfCghr-oY&amp;feature=youtu.be">delivered a TED talk while wearing a full flight suit</a>, in which he offered his vision for the future of nursing, including the need to “deconstruct the hierarchies of care”. </p> <p>Nursing leaders called for Edmonson, who did not respond to a request for an interview, to take responsibility for the fact that two of his nurses had contracted the deadly virus while at work. </p> <p>“As far as the nurses are concerned, there has been no leadership on this issue other than blaming the nurse and blaming the patient,” said Burger. “He is collecting a paycheck for making sure that his employees are safe. He should be held accountable.” </p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/18/fear-disease-cruise-ships-ebola <p>Two summers ago, while vacationing in Cape Cod, my family went on a whale-watching trip on a windy day – and about 80 people out of the 100 or so on the boat got seasick.</p> <p>It started about 30 minutes out of Provincetown Harbor, after we’d rounded the tip of the Cape and chugged through the chop, pitching and rolling, out into the Atlantic Ocean. The first few people leaned their heads into trash buckets and vomited there. </p> <p>There were not nearly enough trash buckets. </p> <p>Soon there were a lot of people vomiting into their hands, and so then a lot of vomit on the seats and tables and floor of the boat (which was not a huge boat – the cabin was about the size of a high-school classroom) and it started to smell very badly of vomit, which led to more and more vomiting. A woman I didn’t know handed me her vomiting baby because she herself needed to vomit. When the captain turned the boat around and headed back to port early, no one complained. It was not a very fun whale watch.</p> <p>Of course, it could have been worse. </p> <p>Imagine being one of the 5,593 people aboard the Carnival Magic cruise ship on your way back to Galveston, Texas after being denied permission to dock in Cozumel, Mexico on Friday due to <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article2932945.html">the presence of a passenger who is being monitored for Ebola</a>. At the behest of the Centers for Disease Control, that person had quarantined herself in a sealed cabin, because she works as a lab technician at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and “may have” handled fluid samples from Thomas Eric Duncan (the Ebola patient who died there more than a week ago). Fully 19 days after her possible exposure, she was not displaying any symptoms. Two more days and she’d be deemed clear. You’d probably be counting the minutes along with her, for selfish reasons as well as sympathetic ones.</p> <p>I’m a little surprised anyone got on that cruise ship in the first place. I have never gone on a cruise, and I don’t think I want to go on one.</p> <p>But when I was a kid, I did: I grew up watching The Love Boat and, like many of my preteen peers in the early 80s, dreamt of stepping off the elevator onto the lido deck with Julie, Gopher, Isaac, Captain Stubing and everyone else, and playing shuffleboard with Charo and the rest of the week’s randy guest stars. </p> <p>I was on board a cruise ship once, accompanying my mother in delivering <em>her</em> mother to a cabin before disembarking to wave from the docks as she and her octogenarian companions set sail for wherever they were destined that trip. It was exciting. She sent us postcards from cities all over the world: she loved it. </p> <p>Still today, I have friends who enjoying cruising very much – old people and young – who tell me that there’s nothing more relaxing than a week on the seas in a building-size pleasure craft, lounging all day with an umbrella drink in your hand, compelled by physical, geographical realities to let your workaday cares drift away, watching the sunset over an endless horizon. </p> <p>But ever since reading David Foster Wallace’s <a href="http://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf">1996 Harper’s essay</a> republished in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Supposedly-Fun-Thing-Never-Again/dp/0316925284">A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again</a> in which he details the existential despair he fell into during the week he spent on a Caribbean cruise – the experience has not seemed like it would be even supposedly fun.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Organized shuffleboard has always filled me with dread. Everything about it suggests infirm senescence and death: it’s a game played on the skin of a void, and the rasp of the sliding puck is the sound of that skin getting abraded away bit by bit.</p> </blockquote> <p>“The skin of a void”. I love that. </p> <p>And then the disease. For years now, we’ve been reading <a href="http://business.time.com/2013/05/28/travelers-still-avoiding-carnival-after-poop-cruise/">reports</a> of mass gastrointestinal illnesses brought about by outbreaks of Norovirus or Rotovirus, or the severe pneumonia of <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)91137-X/abstract">Legionnaire’s Disease</a> – the attendant risks of putting oneself on a giant “<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/29/travel/cruises-sanitation/index.html">floating petri dish</a>” for a week with thousands of questionably hygienic strangers. In February 2013, the Carnival Line cruise ship called Triumph was <a href="http://gawker.com/5984334/disabled-shit-covered-cruise-ship-descends-to-new-circle-of-hell-off-the-coast-of-alabama">redubbed</a> as the much-less-victorious-sounding “Poop Cruise” when a generator fire disabled the power system, stranding passengers for five days of baking in the sun with no air-conditioning and backed-up toilets. </p> <p>On the other hand, in light of our current predicament, maybe a cruise is not such a bad idea after all. It’s tricky, exercising appropriate caution around something invisible and potentially lethal without succumbing to hysteria. We all saw <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/picture-of-woman-in-homemade-hazmat-suit-goes-viral-20141018-1182td.html">the pictures of the person sitting in the airport wearing the homemade hazmat suit</a>. No one wants to be that person.</p> <p>In Colson Whitehead’s wonderful, funny, all-too-relevant 2011 zombie apocalypse book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zone-One-Colson-Whitehead/dp/0307455173/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413649081&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=zone+one+colson+whitehead">Zone One</a>, Gary dreams of escaping the ruined, zombie-infested world by catching a ride on a sub to a far-away Island.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/18/oxfam-call-for-troops-ebola--west-africa-world-health-organisation-accused <p>Anger is growing over the “inadequate” response to the Ebola epidemic this weekend with the World Health Organisation’s Africa office accused of incompetence and world governments of having failed.</p> <p>Aid charities and the president of the World Bank are among the critics, declaring that the fight against the virus is in danger of being lost.</p> <p>On Saturday Oxfam took the unusual step of calling for troops to be sent to west Africa, along with funding and medical staff, to prevent the Ebola outbreak becoming the “definitive humanitarian disaster of our generation”. It accused countries that did not commit military personnel of “costing lives”.</p> <p>The charity said that there was less than a two-month window to curb the spread of the virus but there remained a crippling shortfall in logistical support.</p> <p>Several African countries have for the last decade been suffering severe shortages of homegrown medics thanks to a “brain drain” to countries such as Britain, which rely on foreign workers.</p> <p>The executive director of frontline medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières, Vickie Hawkins, said national and global health systems had failed. “We are angry that the global response to this outbreak has been so slow and inadequate.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="908ab8bb2dce1f747fbd42560335ae8311e3eb9c"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/18/1413649287977/41cc4dc1-05ae-495e-9811-dec4546efd7d-460x276.jpeg" alt="A burial team in protective gear carry the body of woman suspected to have died from Ebola in Monrovia, Liberia." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">A burial team in protective gear carry the body of woman suspected to have died from Ebola in Monrovia, Liberia.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We have been amazed that for months the burden of the response could be carried by one single, private medical organisation, while pleading for more help and watching the situation get worse and worse. When the outbreak is under control, we must reflect on how health systems can have failed quite so badly. But the priority for now must remain the urgent fight against Ebola – we simply cannot afford to fail.”</p> <p>The worst outbreak on record has claimed 4,500 lives, out of 8,914 recorded cases since the start of the year, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The true number is agreed to be higher. There are some 3,700 Ebola orphans.</p> <p>The WHO has said that the worst case scenario was the infection rate reaching 10,000 a week by December but the agency is under heavy fire over a leaked internal report pointing to serious bungling of the epidemic. The WHO, the UN agency designated with coordinating international response to disease outbreaks, missed chances to prevent Ebola from spreading when it was first diagnosed last spring, thanks to incompetent staff, a lack of information and bureaucracy due to “politically motivated appointments”, the report says. “Nearly everyone involved in the response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall,” said the report, obtained by the Associated Press. “A perfect storm was brewing.” The WHO refused to comment on the draft report.</p> <p>Dr Peter Piot, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/04/ebola-zaire-peter-piot-outbreak" title="">co-discoverer of the Ebola virus,</a> said WHO acted too slowly. “It’s the regional office in Africa that’s the front line,” said Piot. “And they didn’t do anything. That office is really not competent.”</p> <p>On Monday EU foreign ministers are due to meet in Brussels and David Cameron has called for fellow European leaders to double their contribution to the Ebola fighting fund. The UK has committed £125m – the second highest sum after the US although aid agencies say help is still not reaching the ground – as well as 750 troops. Cameron is calling for a €1bn (£800m) EU pledge.</p> <p>President Barack Obama on Saturday urged Americans to avoid hysteria over Ebola, and played down the idea of travel bans from Ebola-ravaged countries in west Africa. “We can’t cut ourselves off from west Africa,” Obama said, adding that it would make it harder to move health workers into the region, and would motivate people trying to get out of the region to evade screening. “Trying to seal off an entire region of the world – if that were even possible – could actually make the situation worse,” he said.</p> <p>Obama said it would take time to fight the disease, warning “before this is over, we may see more isolated cases here in America”. He reminded Americans that only three cases had been diagnosed in the country. But Obama has stepped up the US domestic response, naming Ron Klain, a former chief of staff to vice president Joe Biden, the “Ebola response coordinator” – tackling the problems America has with a health service that is fragmented state by state.</p> <p>But World Bank president Jim Yong Kim warned that officials in many countries were focused too much on their own borders. “I still don’t think that the world has understood what the possible downside risk is – not just to the west African economy, but to the global economy. And we are still losing the battle,” he said.</p> <h2>RAPID RESPONSE: THE COUNTRIES THAT GOT IT RIGHT</h2> <h2><strong>NIGERIA</strong></h2> <p>In July, Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian-American, collapsed at Lagos airport. By the time medics realised he had Ebola, 11 people had been infected, four of whom died. A Nigerian task force tracked down and monitored 894 people thought to be at risk, and officials visited 26,000 households. After just 19 confirmed cases and eight deaths, Nigeria is on track to get the all-clear from the WHO.</p> <h2><strong>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO</strong> </h2> <p>An Ebola outbreak began in August, unconnected to the west African epidemic, with 71 cases and 49 deaths to date. The country is credited with mounting an effective response: the ministry of health was on the ground and monitoring the situation within a week of the first death, but it had the advantage that the outbreak occurred in an isolated village, from which it could not easily spread to other communities. The DRC has seen six outbreaks of Ebola since the virus was first identified there in 1976.</p> <h2><strong>SENEGAL</strong></h2> <p>A man who entered the country from Guinea, where he’d had direct contact with an Ebola patient, has been the country’s only confirmed case. Last Friday, declaring Senegal officially free of the Ebola virus, the WHO congratulated the government on its rapid response and diligence, which had prevented a wider outbreak from occurring.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/18/ebola-world-must-do-more-stop-disaster-generation-oxfam <p>Countries must step up efforts to tackle the spread of Ebola in west Africa by providing more troops, funding and medical staff to prevent it from becoming the “definitive humanitarian disaster of our generation”, Oxfam has warned.</p> <p>The charity said the world had less than two months to curb the deadly virus, which has killed 4,500 people, but noted a crippling shortfall in military personnel to provide logistical support across the countries worst affected – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Its stark warning came as Britain and the US said the international community will be responsible for a substantial loss of life in west Africa and a greater threat across the world unless the financial and medical response to Ebola was greatly increased. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said a failure to respond could turn Ebola into “a scourge like HIV or polio”.</p> <p>Oxfam said that while Britain was leading the way in Europe’s response to the epidemic, countries which have failed to commit troops – including Italy and Spain – were “in danger of costing lives”.</p> <p>The charity said it was extremely rare to call for military intervention but troops were desperately needed to build treatment centres, provide flights and offer engineering and logistical support.</p> <p>More doctors and nurses were required to staff the treatment centres and there was a significant shortfall in funding to support the emergency humanitarian response, the agency warned.</p> <p>Its plea for extra resources came as the World Health Organisation (WHO) pledged to conduct a full review of its handling of the Ebola crisis once the outbreak is under control.</p> <p>The promise came in response to a leaked document that appeared to acknowledge the WHO had mishandled the early stages of the outbreak in west Africa.</p> <p>“That review will come, but only after this outbreak is over,” the organisation said.</p> <p>The WHO has been widely criticised for its slow response to the epidemic and its early reassurances – despite repeated public warnings from the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which was leading the fight against the virus on the ground.</p> <p>MSF executive director Vickie Hawkins said on Saturday that the agency was frustrated and angry that the global response to the outbreak had been so slow and inadequate.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the UN’s World Food Programme delivered hundreds of tons of emergency food rations to 265,000 people on Saturday, many of them quarantined in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Oxfam has called for EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday to follow the UK’s lead in responding to the Ebola crisis after the country committed £125m – the highest sum after the US.</p> <p>David Cameron wrote to the European council president, Herman Van Rompuy, to call on EU leaders to agree at a summit next week to donate an extra €1bn (£790m) and to despatch 2,000 European clinicians and workers to the region within a month.</p> <p>Mark Goldring, Oxfam’s chief executive, said: “We are in the eye of a storm. We cannot allow Ebola to immobilise us in fear, but instead we must move toward a common mission to stop it from getting worse.</p> <p>“Countries that have failed to commit troops, doctors and enough funding are in danger of costing lives. The speed and scale of the intervention needed is unprecedented. Only a concerted and coordinated global effort will stop the spread.</p> <p>“Providing treatment is vital, however reducing the spread of infection is equally important, which is why we need the massive intervention of personnel and funding immediately.”</p> <p>An Oxfam spokeswoman added: “The Ebola crisis could become the definitive humanitarian disaster of our generation. The world was unprepared to deal with it. It is extremely rare for Oxfam to call for military intervention to provide logistical support in a humanitarian emergency.</p> <p>“However, the military’s logistical expertise and capacity to respond quickly in great numbers is vital.</p> <p>“The EU can help put the world back on track in the fight against Ebola by boosting military and medical personnel, committing life-saving funds and speeding up the process so that pledges are delivered rapidly in order to prevent, protect and cure people.”</p> <p>In addition to the extra €1bn, Cameron wants EU leaders to agree to dispatch at least 2,000 workers to west Africa within the next month, to increase co-ordination of screening at European ports, and to improve coordination of flights to west Africa to fly frontline health staff to the region. Britain believes Germany is starting to respond, though it considers this has been slow.</p> <p>The US and the UK have committed 4,000 and 750 troops respectively to help tackle Ebola, Oxfam said.</p> <p>But the charity warned only some of these troops are on the ground, with most of the US contingent not due until 1 November.</p> <p>Italy, Australia and Spain have committed no troops, despite Spain having a specialist medical expertise unit in its military, Oxfam said.</p> <p>Germany has committed to military supply flights and plans a military hospital in the region, while France has some military staff in Guinea where personnel are reportedly building a hospital, it added.</p> <p>The WHO has put the death rate from this outbreak at 70% and has warned that there could be 10,000 new cases a week in west Africa by December.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/18/ebola-scourge-hiv-john-kerry <p>Britain and the United States have issued stark warnings that the international community will be responsible for a substantial loss of life in west Africa and a greater threat across the world unless the financial and medical response to the Ebola crisis is intensified.</p> <p>As the World Health Organisation (WHO) admitted mishandling the early stages of the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, US secretary of state John Kerry said a failure to respond could turn Ebola into “a scourge like HIV or polio”.</p> <p>In some of his strongest remarks since the outbreak of the virus, Kerry criticised the international community for providing only a third of the UN target of $1bn (£620m). Speaking to the Washington diplomatic corps at the state department, Kerry called on world leaders to provide cash, helicopters and treatment centres.</p> <p>Reflecting growing impatience with the limited response from countries such as Russia and China, he said: “If we don’t adequately address this current outbreak now, then Ebola has the potential to become a scourge like HIV or polio, that we will end up fighting, all of us, for decades. And we shouldn’t kid ourselves. Winning this fight is going to be costly, it is going to take all of our efforts, and it is not risk-free.”</p> <p>David Cameron wrote to the European council president, Herman Van Rompuy, to call on EU leaders to agree at a summit next week to donate an extra €1bn (£790m) and to despatch 2,000 European clinicians and workers to the region within a month.</p> <p>In his letter in advance of a European summit in Brussels next week, the UK prime minister wrote: “If we do not significantly step up our collective response now, the loss of life and damage to the political, economic and social fabric of the region will be substantial and the threat posed to our citizens will also grow.”</p> <p>In addition to the extra €1bn, Cameron wants EU leaders to agree to dispatch at least 2,000 workers to west Africa within the next month, to increase co-ordination of screening at European ports, and to improve coordination of flights to west Africa to fly frontline health staff to the region. Britain believes Germany is starting to respond, though it considers this has been slow.</p> <p>The interventions by Britain and the US came as:</p> <p>• Barack Obama named an Ebola “tsar” to take charge of combating the virus in the US and health officials revealed they were monitoring 16 people connected to a nurse who has the virus. The government also asked three biology labs to submit plans for producing the experimental anti-Ebola drug ZMapp;</p> <p>• GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical group, said a vaccine it was working on would be “too late for this epidemic”;</p> <p>• the death toll rose to 4,546 out of 9,191 cases in west Africa.</p> <p>Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) warned that international pledges were not having any impact on the spread of the virus. Christopher Stokes, who is leading the charity’s response, welcomed pledges of help, but <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-29656417" title="">told the BBC</a> they were “not having any significant impact on the epidemic and it won’t now for maybe another month or month and a half”.</p> <p>The sense of chaos was highlighted when a WHO draft internal document obtained by the Associated Press accepted there was widespread failure to recognise the risks of the disease in the fragile states of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. “Nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall.” Experts should have realised that the conventional way of containing an Ebola outbreak would not work in a region with porous borders and broken health systems, the document said.</p> <p>The warnings came after Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, chided the international community because only $100,000 had been paid into his $1bn trust fund to fight Ebola. A further $20m has been pledged but not received. A wider UN appeal has received $376m, about 38% of the amount the UN is seeking to raise for that appeal.</p> <p>Kofi Annan, a former UN secretary general, said he was “bitterly disappointed” with the response of the international community, which would have been different if the crisis had erupted in the west. Annan told BBC Newsnight: “If the crisis had hit some other region it probably would have been handled very differently. In fact, when you look at the evolution of the crisis, the international community really woke up when the disease got to America and Europe.”</p> <p>Cameron made clear his impatience with the slow response of fellow EU leaders in his letter to Van Rompuy which is designed to encourage EU leaders to “wake up” to the crisis, in the words of the UK’s international development secretary Justine Greening.</p> <p>In the letter to Van Rompuy, Cameron wrote: “The Ebola outbreak in west Africa is an issue that requires a substantial global response. The rapid spread of the disease and recent cases outside the west African region demonstrate the magnitude of the task at hand. The WHO forecast 20,000 cases in west Africa by November 2014.</p> <p>“I believe that much more must be done. The European Council next week provides us with the opportunity to commit to an ambitious package of support to help reduce the rate of transmission in west Africa, to reduce the risk of transmission within Europe, and to pledge long-term support to assist with recovery, resilience and stability in the region. By coordinating our approach, I believe the EU and its member states can maximise the effectiveness of our response.”</p> <p>Britain believes itself and the US have led the world response to the Ebola crisis. Britain has pledged more than £125m in aid to Sierra Leone because of its historic ties to its former west African colony. Britain is providing more than 700 treatment beds across the country, while 750 troops are to be deployed there.</p> <p>The US and France are focusing on Liberia and Guinea because of their own historic ties to the countries.</p> <p>The prime minister’s pointed remarks are also aimed at China and Russia which are seen to have failed to rise to the occasion. But Xiaoyan Jiang, spokeswoman for the Chinese mission to the EU, defended China’s contributions, saying that prime minister Li Kegiang had pledged another 100 million yuan (£10.1m) at the ASEM summit in Milan.</p> <p>That figure came on top of the 234m yuan (£23.7m) already spent by Beijing on emergency assistance in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, she added. China had also sent some 200 medical staff to the three countries, and the plan was for them to “help train more than 10,000 medical personnel” on the ground. </p> <p>“I can assure you China has done a lot. We have provided a lot of assistance to the African countries,” she said. Russian officials on Thursday said the government had earmarked £11.9 million to fight the spread of the Ebola virus in west Africa. Russia has also deployed a team of health workers to Guinea to help fight the epidemic, chief sanitation doctor Anna Popova said during a meeting with the prime minister Dmitry Medvedev on Friday.</p> <p>French aid to Guinea adds up to more than €70m. Of this, half is being spent in Guinea and on preventative measures in neighbouring countries, including Ivory Coast.</p> <p>France is setting up an Ebola treatment centre in Guinea operated by the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières, and a Pastor Institute in Conakry to train Guinean biologists in collaboration with the Pastor Institutes in Dakar and Paris.</p> <p>France is also beefing up laboratories in seven west African countries, including Guinea. The other half has been given to internationally coordinated measures, including the European Commission, the World Bank and the African Development Bank.</p> <p>The German government has so far promised to support the aid effort in west Africa with a total of €102m. After originally promising to spend €17m, the government announced on Thursday that it would allocate a further €85m to fight Ebola.</p> <p>“What we are doing to help in west Africa is necessary help for the people there, but also effective protection for the people of Europe”, said health minister Herman Gröhe.</p> <p>Of the additional €85m, €50m will be assigned to the development ministry, while €35m will go to the German foreign office.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/18/ebola-liberian-president-phones-dallas-mayor-about-infected-nurses <p><em>Editor’s note: a spokeswoman for the mayor of Dallas has contacted the Guardian to dispute aspects of this story. A full update will be posted when further reporting is complete.</em></p> <p>The president of Liberia telephoned the mayor of Dallas and apologised for the fact that the Ebola virus had transferred from her country to his city and infected Americans, the mayor said during a conference call with religious leaders in Texas on Friday.<br /></p> <p>The mayor, Mike Rawlings, said President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf had said she felt accountable for the situation in the Texan city, where a man who had recently returned from Liberia infected two nurses who treated him before he died, according to two people on the conference call.</p> <p>“The mayor said that there was a call to him personally, and that the Liberian president had mentioned apologies, and, in his words, a little bit of responsibility that this was even happening,” Rex Howe, a pastor at Scofield Memorial church, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Dr John Carlo, a former medical director for Dallas county and the chief executive of an Aids prevention non-profit, added that Rawlings said he “did not accept” the president’s apology. “He feels that this is a global community, and there was no fault by the Liberian people,” said Carlo, who addressed the faith leaders after the mayor. “I think that was a good message.”</p> <p>The Liberian patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, died on 8 October, almost three weeks after flying to the US from Monrovia, the capital of the west African state, where thousands of people have been killed by an outbreak of Ebola. He had come into contact with a woman there infected with the virus.</p> <p>Two nurses who helped treat Duncan before he died at Texas Health Dallas Presbyterian hospital, Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, became the first two people known to have contracted Ebola on US soil. They are being treated in specialist facilities in Georgia and Maryland. Pham’s condition was lowered by health officials on Friday from good to fair.</p> <p>Howe, the pastor, said the mayor had also recounted telling Sirleaf that once Dallas had taken stock of its “failures and successes” in dealing with the virus, “there may be things we can share with both the US and the rest of the world about what we’ve learned, about what to do and what not to do”.</p> <p>Asked to confirm that Sirleaf had called the mayor, Gabriel Williams, a spokesman for the Liberian embassy in Washington, said: “I wouldn’t be able to comment on that right now.” A public relations firm handling media for Rawlings did not return requests for comment.</p> <p>Rawlings also disclosed during the call that the first of 48 people being isolated and monitored by authorities for signs of Ebola, after coming into contact with Duncan when he became ill, had emerged from quarantine after the required 21 days without symptoms. The man, who was not identified, was said have visited Duncan’s apartment after he began feeling sick on 24 September.</p> <p>Duncan’s fiancee, Louise Troh, remains quarantined until the end of the weekend. Troh’s 13-year-old son, Duncan’s nephew, and another man – all of whom were staying with Duncan in the same apartment – are also scheduled to emerge from the same restrictions at the same time as Troh.</p> <p>An estimated 100 faith leaders were invited to join the conference call on Friday afternoon. Participants received an email invitation from Amanda Sanchez, Rawlings’s community outreach coordinator.</p> <p>Rawlings was also said to have reiterated a warning he has made elsewhere that “we’re not out of the woods yet” and that another diagnosis should not come as a surprise. “Honestly, we should expect to see another case or two,” Howe recalled the mayor saying.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/17/manchester-city-yaya-toure-no-fears-ebola <p>Yaya Touré and Manchester City have no concerns over Ebola despite the Ivory Coast midfielder having just returned from Africa where he played against DR Congo in Abidjan last Wednesday.</p> <p>The Ivory Coast is in the west African region that is the epicentre of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-britain-david-cameron-ban-ki-moon" title="">Ebola outbreak</a>, with neighbouring Guinea the country where the crisis began. Yet Manuel Pellegrini said the club and Touré were not worried about him having travelled there.</p> <p>“No really, we are not concerned about it. Yaya is not concerned either,” the manager said, before admitting he was unsure if Touré had been tested when travelling to and from Ivory Coast. “I suppose he is sure about that problem – I don’t think he will have any problems. I don’t know if he was screened but for the moment he’s OK.”</p> <p>Pellegrini also conceded that as Aleksandar Kolarov and Matija Nastasic were part of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/oct/16/serbia-albania-riot-ivan-bogdanov" title="">Serbia team that took part in Wednesday evening’s troubled Euro 2016 qualifier</a> with Albania, this is not the best preparation for the visit of Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday.</p> <p>He said: “They have both come back on Thursday. Of course, it was not a good experience for them. It’s very difficult to be involved in those kinds of incidents. We will see what happens in the future. But it was a very bad thing for football. In both a political sense and football sense.”</p> <p>Bacary Sagna, who as a former Arsenal right-back who played in many north London derbies, warned his new City team-mates of a backlash after Spurs were defeated 11-1 over last season’s two matches.</p> <p>“Personally, I want to win just as much as I wanted to before when I played for Arsenal. It was a derby then so it was a bit different. But we still have to win this game. We have to focus,” he said. “The manager has not mentioned it [last term] at all. It is going to be a totally different game. They will want to come here and show it was a mistake. I remember watching it on television and I was amazed because City seemed to be scoring with every chance they had. Now it will be a totally different game and they will be trying to be more consistent.</p> <p>“They have always been a tough opponent. They have quality players and a good team, they can finish near the top. We must focus on our team, though, and not worry about others.”</p> <p>Sagna described his French countryman Eliaquim Mangala, who misses Spurs’s visit because of a muscle problem, as almost like a family member. “It’s my responsibility to help him. I remember when I came here, I didn’t speak proper English. But he’s a lovely guy and he’s settled in well. He has everything he needs to be a top player and I’m sure he will be.</p> <p>“To me he will be one of the best defenders in the world, but he’s still young and there’s a lot of room to improve. He will keep working hard and I’ll be pushing him to become of the best.</p> <p>“I’m everything to him, he’s like my twin brother, my son.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-infected-nurse-stable-condition-specialist-maryland-hospital <p>A nurse who contracted the Ebola virus while treating Thomas Eric Duncan is stable and resting comfortably after being transferred to a specialised hospital in Maryland, leaving the embattled Dallas hospital where she works free of an Ebola patient for the first time in nearly three weeks.</p> <p>Nina Pham, 26, “is quite stable now” and “in good spirits”, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said at a press conference on Friday. </p> <p>Fauci said Pham has been able to sit up, eat and use her iPad. “She’s a highly intelligent, aware person who knows exactly what’s going on,” he said.</p> <p>Pham’s condition has gone from “good” when she left Dallas to “fair”, Fauci said, but he declined to explain the change, citing patient confidentiality. He said only that she was fatigued from her flight, adding that fair condition “implies that she does still have some symptoms”. Pham has received a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor, Dr Kent Brantly, a treatment doctors hoped would provide her with antibodies against the virus; for privacy reasons Fauci would not say if she had also received experimental drugs. <br /></p> <p>“We fully intend to have this patient walk out of this hospital,” Fauci added.</p> <p>Duncan, who contracted the virus before arriving in the US, died in an isolation unit at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas on 8 October. Since then, two nurses, Pham and Amber Vinson, have been diagnosed with Ebola.</p> <p>In all, more than 135 people are being monitored for signs of Ebola, including 75 healthcare workers, 48 other people who may have had contact with Duncan and a handful of people who may have had contact with the nurses, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/texas-ebola-nurse-dog">one dog</a>.</p> <p>Vinson was transferred to Emory University hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, earlier this week for treatment at a specialist facility there. A day before Vinson was diagnosed, she travelled on a Frontier Airlines commercial flight from Ohio to Texas, despite having a low-grade fever.</p> <p>Vinson, who was self-monitoring at the time, had called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) before travelling to Ohio, and was not stopped from flying. <br /></p>  <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/17/ebola-patient-quarantine-texas-hospital-video"                        data-show-ads="true"                data-video-id="2177267"                data-video-name="Ebola patient speaks from quarantined bed in Texas hospital – video"                data-video-provider="ITN"                data-video-poster="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/17/1413535785963/Nina-Pham-Ebola-patient-i-017.jpg"> <video data-media-id="gu-video-449990168" class="gu-video" controls="controls" poster="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/17/1413535772581/Nina-Pham-Ebola-patient-i-007.jpg"> <source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/10/17/141017EbolaNurse-16x9.mp4"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/10/17/141017EbolaNurse_3gpSml16x9.3gp"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/10/17/141017EbolaNurse/141017EbolaNurse.m3u8"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/10/17/141017EbolaNurse.webm"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/10/17/141017EbolaNurse_3gpLg16x9.3gp"></source> </video> <figcaption>Nina Pham, the first Texas nurse to be diagnosed with Ebola, is seen in her hospital bed via video link. The patient can be seen wiping away tears as she speaks to doctors, telling them she does not need anything. Pham is being transferred to an isolation unit in Maryland </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Thursday, the CDC announced that it was expanding its search for possible contacts, and interviewing passengers who travelled on Vinson’s initial Frontier Airlines flight from Dallas to Cleveland on 10 October, because new information revealed that investigators could not rule out the possibility that she was ill as early as last Friday. It was initially thought she became ill on 13 October, the day she returned to Dallas. The agency has since changed its guidelines on travel for people being monitored for the virus.</p> <p>The CDC director, Tom Frieden, said the agency will ensure that in future those being monitored for symptoms of the virus do not travel publicly. The CDC recommends only “controlled movement” for individuals being monitored, which can include travel by private plane or vehicle. In Dallas, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/texas-healthcare-workers-ebola-public">county officials have asked</a> all 75 healthcare workers under monitoring to sign “voluntary agreements” to avoid public areas for the duration of their 21-day incubation period.</p> <p>Even so, on Friday morning, the state department announced that a hospital worker who may have had contact with Duncan’s blood samples, had left the country on a Caribbean cruise while self-monitoring. He has placed himself in voluntary quarantine, and the ship’s doctor said he is in good condition. The hospital worker left for his cruise before the CDC made the announcement. </p> <p>In Texas, meanwhile, Governor Rick Perry on Friday urged the president to ban travel from the west African nations where Ebola is raging.</p> <p>“Air travel is in fact how this disease crosses borders and it’s certainly how it got to Texas in the first place,” Perry said during a news conference in Austin. He said there should be an exception for aid workers, who are desperately needed to help fight the virus in west Africa. Several members of Congress, including the speaker of the House, John Boehner, have called for a travel ban, which the president has been reluctant to consider.</p> <p>Public health officials have decried a ban that would prevent travellers from west Africa’s hardest-hit countries – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – from entering the US. They say it will restrict aid and healthcare workers from entering the countries, which could exacerbate the outbreak that has already claimed the lives of more than 4,500 people. </p> <p>Perry also discussed preliminary recommendations from a task force he assembled last week charged with improving the state’s readiness to deal with additional Ebola cases.</p> <p>The task force suggested designating Ebola treatment centres across the state where ill people can with the relevant travel history can seek treatment. </p> <p>The centres would be equipped with protective equipment and specially trained healthcare workers. </p> <p>The force also recommended that healthcare workers receive expanded training on how to handle patients with deadly infectious diseases.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/17/isis-ebola-twin-threats-islamic-state <p>They are dark, unseen enemies, come from far away – and they are scaring us witless. Isis is not a disease, and Ebola is not a terror organisation. But fear is their common currency: intentional for one, inevitable for the other. Today they can seem to be working in tandem, a pincer movement paralysing the world’s governments as it terrifies the world’s people. Each time one advances, the space for the other expands.</p> <p>From the vantage point of the west, the similarities are obvious. It starts with a menace that was once obscure and understood by few, with a name that keeps shifting (is it Isis, Isil or IS?) or a pronunciation that is uncertain (is it ee-boh-la or ebb-ola?), and which suddenly becomes all-pervasive, threatening catastrophe.</p> <p>In both cases, the turning point came when the victims were no longer distant others, but people deemed to be like us. So the Islamic State became impossible to ignore not when <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/shocking-footage-shows-isis-thugs-3932256" title="">it conducted mass executions, on camera, of hundreds of Iraqi and Syrian fighters</a>, but when it beheaded western hostages, men whose names sounded like our own: James Foley, Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning. Ebola was an African problem until cases surfaced in places we could point to on a map: Madrid or Dallas. The Isis and Ebola stories are both captured by <a href="http://mic.com/articles/100618/one-powerful-illustration-shows-exactly-what-s-wrong-with-media-coverage-of-ebola" title="">a simple André Carrilho cartoon</a> showing a ward full of dying black people – with a cluster of TV cameras huddling around the lone white victim.</p> <p>But the greater similarity is the feeling of impotence that both crises prompt. The US, the most armed nation in the history of humankind, the world’s hyperpower, which <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/military-spending-cuts/u-s-military-spending-dwarfs-rest-world-n37461" title="">spends more on weapons than the 10 next highest-spending nations combined</a>, that country – along with five European allies and partners from the Gulf states – is pounding Isis from the air and yet making only marginal progress. No one is talking of victory over Isis; most speak of merely containing it. Meanwhile, the same US, with all its state-of-the-art technology and germproof suits, couldn’t prevent one of its nurses catching Ebola. You can hardly blame those inside and outside America who look at both situations and feel overwhelmed.</p> <p>Against that impotence rages the cry that something must be done. It loses little ardour when it is confronted with evidence that that something is likely to do no good.</p> <p>From the start, military strategists pointed out the obvious defects in a policy of air strikes against Isis. Surely its fighters would hide themselves and their (serious) military kit rather than remain exposed in plain sight, as a nicely accessible target. And if Isis did hide among civilians, then western attacks would end up killing innocents not militants, thereby creating sympathy, and recruits, for the jihadists. As for the British (and European) willingness to hit Isis in Iraq but not Syria, that surely was to insist on a border that had been erased by war. Isis operates in both countries, combining them into a single battlefield. Surely it was quaintly legalistic of America’s allies to preserve a distinction that events had made defunct.</p> <p>The errors in the anti-Ebola strategy were just as obvious. “Enhanced screening” at British airports and Eurostar terminals carries the smack of firm, decisive action. But health experts coughed politely and noted that such screening would not pick up those whose symptoms were not yet visible, and would be no protection at all against those who lied about their movements.</p> <p>The experts further warned that a likely product of such measures would be increased anxiety, which might hinder ��� not help – the one action that really would make a difference: getting doctors and nurses to go to west Africa and combat Ebola on the ground.</p> <p>It’s not as if policymakers don’t hear these warnings. They do. As chief of staff to Tony Blair during a decade in Downing Street, Jonathan Powell managed a fair few crises. He says of President Obama and Isis: “He knows bombing has no chance. He wants to be the man who ends wars, not starts them. He’s taking action he knows can’t succeed. There’s a logical dissonance there and it shows.”</p> <p>David Cameron is, no doubt, similarly conflicted, though for different reasons. He surely believes air strikes over Iraq but not Syria make little sense, but political reality – given parliament’s veto of action against Syria last year – means he can act in one area but not the other. On both Isis and Ebola politicians are aware of the limits on their capabilities, yet have to make a show of mastery and control. On Friday, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-czar-white-house-outbreak-ron-klain" title="">Obama appointed an Ebola tsar</a>, a title that suggests a contagious disease can be instructed to recede by imperial fiat.</p> <p>But the biggest problem might also be the most prosaic. It is simply that these two big crises have struck at once. In 1999, during the Kosovo war, I asked a White House official about progress on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. He confessed to me that even the White House – regularly imagined by Hollywood as the throbbing heart of power, bursting with might – could only cope with one major international issue at a time.</p> <p>Powell puts the capacity a little higher than that, recalling his own “rule of six”, by which he could cope with six problems – small, medium or large – at once, but no more. He pictured himself running between spinning plates. If there was too much going on, “lack of time, lack of space, meant you couldn’t get back to that first plate”.</p> <p>That is especially true in presidential or quasi-presidential systems, where any big decision has to be taken by the person at the top. There are only so many hours in the day, only so much room in the leader’s head. When people speak of “limited bandwidth”, this is what they mean.</p> <p>Of course, that’s always been true: leaders have to deal with both the crises the public know about and those boiling away below the surface, as well as trying to advance their own agenda, rather than merely reacting to events. But in an age that Michael Ignatieff describes as “<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/sep/25/new-world-disorder/" title="">the new world disorder</a>”, where Isis and Ebola take their place alongside an ongoing war in Ukraine, and where the authoritarian behemoths Russia and China are becoming more assertive, that is becoming harder than ever.</p> <p>There is simply not enough capacity to deal with all these problems at once. We make mistakes in our handling of each of them, and so they all get worse. Isis feeds Ebola, and Ebola feeds Isis – and our fear feeds them both.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-outbreak-in-texas-lays-bare-disjointed-government-response <p>On Wednesday the President of the United States cancelled a fundraising trip, and – seated in a leather-backed chair with the Stars and Stripes behind him – addressed the nation. “I thought it was very important for me to bring together our team,” he said, radiating an air of calm and control, “to hear directly from them in terms of how we are ramping up our efforts here.”</p> <p>“I want people to understand that the dangers of you contracting Ebola, the dangers of a serious outbreak, are extraordinarily low,” he concluded. “But we are taking this very seriously at the highest levels of government.”</p> <p>A casual observer would have been forgiven for seeing, in this picture, a coordinated response: a single, unified government fully in control, with a clear chain of responsibility. But in truth, no such coordination exists.</p> <p>The reasons for this are rooted in the fragmented, federalised nature of the United States. Activists and state governments, especially those controlled by the Republican party, have in recent years fought tooth and nail against what they see as perpetual federal overreach. This is all well and good, right up until a moment like this, when suddenly everyone starts asking: why isn’t the government doing anything?</p> <p>Nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital, where Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the US was treated and died, and where two nurses who cared for him contracted the virus, have reportedly told a nurses’ union that they were not given proper protective gear. The hospital has denied this, but if it is true, why didn’t the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) step in and provide it for them? </p> <p>They have also reportedly said that the hospital did not have clear protocols for the treatment of Duncan, and that it kept changing the protocols it did have – so why didn’t the CDC just put protocols in place for it? </p> <p>Ebola’s not really the problem. “This has become an issue only because of the missteps,” said Joseph McCormick, the former chief of the special pathogens branch of the division of viral diseases at the CDC and an expert in Ebola. “If there had been no missteps – if they had gotten this guy in, gotten him stabilised – everyone would be saying ‘great job’. [Ebola’s] not a threat to anybody – except the healthcare workers.”</p> <p>Any alleged failings in the hospital’s procedure and preparation were probably compounded by the murky, or even non-existent, chain of command at work in a situation like this one. The system is fragmented – by design – across state lines, and unless and until things get worse, neither the CDC nor Ron Klain – the former chief of staff to Vice-President Joe Biden who is now Obama’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-czar-white-house-outbreak-ron-klain">newly appointed “Ebola czar”</a> – have direct authority over hospitals or state health departments, though McCormick said of Klain’s appointment that “if it improves coordination and communication in any way it will help”.</p> <p>“Unless the president invokes very specific powers of the presidency, all public health is a states’ rights issue,” said Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “The CDC doesn’t have the power to just walk into a state and take over.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="3e656d26c4566938b64d5b55842214f36f9b449f"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/17/1413570893932/a3434893-915e-4c3e-bd67-9dcc10716441-460x276.jpeg" alt="ron klain" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Ron Klain, a former chief of staff to vice-president Joe Biden, has been appointed to coordinate the official response to Ebola but his powers are limited.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only if Ebola becomes a national epidemic crossing multiple state borders will federal agencies such as the CDC have any real power over local or state authorities. For now, “the CDC does everything by persuasion,” said Bill Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University medical centre in Nashville, Tennessee. Usually, he said, “they have such status, standing, that essentially everyone falls in line, listens and collaborates with their recommendations.”</p> <p>But there is no system for ensuring that this is the case. Each of the country’s more than 6,000 hospitals is responsible for their own internal infection control and training. They are advised – but not supervised – by the CDC.</p> <p>“The CDC has provided a long list of recommendations about how to do infection control within healthcare facilities, but the execution of that has been left to individual hospitals,” said Schaffner. “I don’t know what went wrong [in Dallas] for a fact,” he said. “But it would appear the hospital never seriously considered that a patient with Ebola would turn up.”</p> <p>During a call with reporters on Wednesday, the CDC director, Tom Frieden, speaking about Duncan and the infection of the two nurses, said: “Our investigations increasingly suggest that the first several days before the patient was diagnosed, appear to be the highest-risk period. That was the 28th, 29th and 30th.” </p> <p>During the whole of that crucial period there was no representation from the CDC on site, whether to take command of the situation or simply ensure procedures were being followed. People from the CDC finally arrived after the diagnosis was confirmed on 30 September. </p> <p>By that time, it appears now, it was already too late: the two nurses, Amber Vinson and Nina Pham, had probably already been infected. </p> <p>“It’s clear to me even that if they thought they had a protocol – they didn’t,” McCormick said of the hospital.</p> <p>“You can tell that with all the missteps from the moment Mr Duncan walked in: they clearly didn’t have a protocol for when someone walks in and says ‘I’m from west Africa and I’m ill.’ He had come from Monrovia, for Christ’s sake. There’s just so many missteps it’s mind-boggling.”</p> <p>“We’re talking about them winging it,” he said.</p> <p>Even if the CDC does step in and impose its will, its guidelines for the treatment of Ebola patients may not be strict enough, McCormick said. Médecins San Frontières (MSF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), both of which are currently fighting the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, have much stricter operational procedures than those recommended by the CDC. </p> <p>Panu Saaristo, the emergency health coordinator for the IFRC, said the guidelines that it and MSF use include a completely sealed suit, while the CDC’s position on the matter has been murky at best – on Wednesday Frieden told reporters that “some of the forms of [personal protective equipment] used did allow exposure of some parts of the skin”.</p> <p>The procedures used by MSF and the IFRC also call for washing suit-gloves and other areas with bleach after any possible contact with the virus. The CDC’s protocols do not include that, which “shocked” McCormick.</p> <p>The CDC is now, after the poor response in Texas, planning to send a site manager to assist any new hospitals treating Ebola patients, though Ben Haynes, a spokesman for the CDC, told the Guardian that all their personnel on the ground would still report to state and hospital authorities.</p> <p>In any case, for McCormick this was all too little, and far, far too late. “Somebody needs to be in charge,” McCormick said. “This protocol and the way we’re handling these patients is not working. It needs to be fixed, and it needs to be fixed today.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/nhs-medics-volunteer-sierra-leone-ebola-nursing-call-up <p>More than 800 NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics have signed up to work in Sierra Leone as the spread of Ebola continues to outpace efforts to contain the virus.</p> <p>But medical charities operating in west Africa warn that “hysteria” whipped up about a potential outbreak in Europe or the US could compromise efforts to attract thousands more volunteers that are needed.</p> <p>Sean Casey, head of International Medical Corps’s Ebola emergency response team in Liberia, said: “There’s some serious fear and paranoia around that’s not based on facts, and they haven’t anything to worry about. If someone doesn’t have symptoms you can’t give someone Ebola.”</p> <p>After an exhausting two-month trip in Sierra Leone and Liberia, returning to London has been a shock for Casey. Within hours of touching down, one of his colleagues, a Spanish nurse returning from Liberia has just been told by her friends she is no longer welcome in their flat.</p> <p>“If people feel like they are going to be a pariah they are not going to volunteer. These people who volunteer should feel like heroes. They have risked everything,” Casey said. “But if people are worried that when they come home they are going to be looked down upon and shunned by their families and friends, this could really compromise the response.”</p> <p>US-born Casey said that compared to volunteer numbers after last year’s earthquake in the Philippines “we have seen a slow trickle at best”.</p> <p>“These cases in the US and Spain have been isolated. Ebola is not going to knock down these countries, but if it gets into places like Senegal, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, especially in this paranoid environment it will be a catastrophe on an unimaginable scale,” he said.</p> <p>With the US and the UK committed to building more than 20 new Ebola treatment units in Sierra Leone and Liberia, pressure on recruitment is growing. The Department for International Development (DfID) is scheduled to open its 100-bed hospital outside the Sierra Leone capital Freetown on 27 October, and there are plans to build four more Ebola treatment hospitals in Sierra Leone, taking capacity up to 700-beds over the coming months. These five facilities alone will require up to 2,000 international staff, DfID told the Guardian.</p> <p>The first NHS volunteers are expected to arrive around November or December but over time will be absorbed by other agencies on the ground. They will be seconded for up to two months with their salaries paid by DfID.</p> <p>Tony Redmond of emergency charity UK Med, which is managing the NHS recruitment, appealed for more workers qualified in nursing, general medicine, infectious specialists and paramedics to come forward. But he says the response so far has been heartening given the dangers.</p> <p>“It’s been phenomenal, it’s very moving. Dame Sally Davies, [chief medical officer for England] was at one of our events for volunteers this week and it was clear she was very moved by the people coming forward,” Redmond said.</p> <p>While there remains clearly a risk of staff catching Ebola, “healthcare professionals are trained at managing risk, respect their colleagues and are most comfortable following protocols and they trust themselves and their colleagues to do that”.</p> <p>London-based intensive-care nurse Margarita Toumasou, who responded to a separate volunteer appeal by Avaaz, the online campaign, said: “There are risks every day with our job with HIV, with hepatitis. They need people to deliver the therapeutic care. They are not getting the numbers they need and we are trained to cope with risk.”</p> <p>The campaign to attract volunteers has its own problems however, including a bottleneck in training. So far only 130 out of the 800 volunteers have been vetted for suitability, and 120 of those have been approved. They will then still need two weeks of training in the UK followed by more “live” training in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>“The cold training in the classroom is manageable, but the hot-training can only be done in treatment centres. People have to buddy up – doctors with doctors and nurses with nurses and do the rounds. This all takes time,” said Casey, warning that more resources are urgently needed on this front.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/17/ebola-czar-obama-administration-ron-klain-power <p>This time, no one is calling for a Senate vote. </p> <p>The announcement by the White House on Friday that Ron Klain had been appointed “Ebola czar” was met with <a href="https://twitter.com/exjon/status/523126435754819584">derision</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jimgeraghty/status/523123925526401024">from</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/forbeshealth/status/523137433022369792">Republicans</a> who questioned Klain’s qualifications.</p> <p>But one thing they weren’t questioning: Klain’s job title. “Czar”, it appears, has been rehabilitated as an acceptable term for a person in government in charge of something very serious.</p> <p>Gone is the outcry of 2009, when 123 members of Congress co-sponsored a bill to strip the salaries of dozens of so-called “czars” serving in the Obama administration. Obama has placed “czars” in charge of issues ranging from border patrol to healthcare reform to climate change. </p> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr3226">The Czar Accountability and Reform Act (HR 3226)</a>, authored by Georgia congressman Jack Kingston, argued that the administration was making an end-run around Congress by empowering presidential appointees without Senate approval. Certain critics of the practice <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/10/13/fox-amp-friends-wants-an-ebola-czar-after-sugge/201131">went somewhat further</a>, linking Obama’s use of czars to the pre-Bolshevik Russian leadership (those guys whose titles were spelled with a “ts”). The legislation never came up for a vote.</p> <p>But the czar controversy was more than just a partisan brickbat. Even respected Senate historian Robert Byrd, the Democratic congressman from West Virginia, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/02/25/25greenwire-byrd-questions-obamas-use-of-policy-czars-9865.html">questioned</a> the “rapid and easy accumulation of power by the White House” through czar appointments. The fact that Obama’s predecessor, George W Bush, had appointed dozens of czars (the practice was common through the 20th century, going back at least to FDR during the second world war) was not seen as vindicating. </p> <p>Whatever concerns Congress had about Obama’s use of czars appear to have subsided in the face of the Ebola threat. As <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/10/13/john_mccains_new_humiliation_why_his_ebola_czar_idea_is_particularly_ludicrous/">American writer (and former Guardian blogger) Jim Newell</a> and others have noted, some of the loudest voices calling for an Ebola czar have come from the Republican side, and indeed from politicians who had once upon a time <a href="https://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain/status/1972425520">colorfully condemned</a> the president’s czarism. </p> <p>“We believe it is imperative that you designate a single, senior advisor who will be responsible for coordinating all US agencies and policies involving the international and domestic response to Ebola,” Republican legislators Jerry Moran and Frank Wolf wrote to the president <a href="http://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=2b793cbd-b19a-42f3-92e6-92bb3a368890">earlier this month</a>. </p> <p>A single, senior advisor responsible for coordinating all agencies and policies. If only there were a handy word for that.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/17/ebola-funding-how-much-where <p>The Ebola crisis has exposed failings in the ability of leading global institutions to respond to an admittedly unprecedented health emergency. As <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/un-ebola-ban-ki-moon-international-community" title="">world leaders chide one another</a> for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-britain-david-cameron-ban-ki-moon" title="">failing to dedicate enough funds</a> to fighting the virus in west Africa, and the consequences of neglecting health systems in some of the world’s poorest countries become ever more obvious, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/09/ebola-outbreak-response-breakdown-key-funding-pledges" title="">the cogs of international aid are beginning to turn</a>. But the money is only dribbling in slowly, and there are concerns that the virus is already out of control in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</p> <p>On 16 September, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it needed $988m (£617m) to tackle the disease in those three countries in the six months up until February 2015. OCHA presented a <a href="https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/CAP/Ebola_outbreak_Sep_2014.pdf" title="">detailed overview of requirements</a> (pdf) outlining what the money would be spent on and by whom.</p> <p>So far, <a href="http://fts.unocha.org/reports/daily/ocha_R3_A1060___17_October_2014_(13_21).pdf" title="">$378m has been received</a> (pdf) (about 38%) and a further $217m has been pledged.</p> <p>“These needs go beyond the sizeable medical requirements needed to treat, contain, and prevent the Ebola outbreak, and include needs and requirements related to non-Ebola medical service (ie reproductive healthcare and malaria and tuberculosis (TB) treatment), food availability, clean water, livelihoods and logistics concerns related to travel and transport of goods and services within and outside the Ebola-affected areas,” the document says.</p> <p>The September overview allocates $473.3m to Liberia, $220.5m to Sierra Leone and $194.2m to Guinea. A further $57.5m is slated for common services.</p> <p>The overview also breaks down the funding according to project: $189.5m is allocated to identifying and tracing people with Ebola; $23.8m to carrying out safe and dignified burials; $331.2m to care for people with Ebola and infection control; $14m to medical care for responders; $107.7m to provision of food security and nutrition; $97.1m to access to basic (including non-Ebola) health services; $2.5m to cash incentives for workers; $64.8m to recovery and economy; $42.6m for reliable supplies of material and equipment; $23.4m to transport and fuel; $45.8m to social mobilisation and community engagement; and $3.2m to messaging. An additional $11.9m is allocated to common services, and another $30.5m slated for preparedness to prevent outbreaks to countries not currently affected.</p> <p>This jargon-heavy wishlist gives a sense of the multifaceted approach required to deal with a crisis that threatens the very existence of societies. This week, the head of the World Health Organisation, Dr Margaret Chan, said she had “never seen an infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure”.</p> <p>However, the $988m total does not capture all the resources donated, as some countries have sent frontline medical staff, while private individuals have also channelled money directly to organisations such as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ebola-outbreak-donation-wife" title="">the CDC Foundation</a>, a private, non-profit organisation securing donations to help the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> <p>In addition to the $988m outlined in the needs and requirements report, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has called for a $1bn trust fund to be set up in order to act as a rapid, flexible spending reserve. On Thursday, the UN chief said that so far only $100,000 has been deposited – from Colombia – into the <a href="http://mptf.undp.org/factsheet/fund/EBO00" title="">Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) for Ebola Response</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/ebolaresponse/needs.shtml" title="">UN says</a> the MPTF will “ensure a coherent UN system contribution to the overall Ebola outbreak response. The fund is guided by the strategic priorities set out in the OCHA overview of needs and requirements. The trust fund seeks contributions from member states, regional legislative bodies, inter-governmental or nongovernmental organisations, businesses and individuals.”</p> <p>The UN also has its own dedicated emergency response fund, which is an ongoing funding mechanism, the <a href="http://www.unocha.org/cerf/" title="">Central Emergency Response Fund (Cerf)</a>. This is a pooled fund, and donors cannot earmark contributions for a specific cause. Cerf has so far allocated $13.8m to projects outlined in the UN Ebola needs and requirements plan.</p> <p>As well as cash, the UN has compiled a <a href="http://www.un.org/ebolaresponse/needs.shtml" title="">list of in-kind</a> (non-cash) elements it needs. These include helicopters, ships, fuel, vehicles, mobile laboratory facilities, static non-Ebola medical clinics, emergency medical evacuation capability for aid workers potentially exposed to the virus, 3.3m items of high-quality personal protective equipment, and training.</p> <p>It has shared this list with member states, but says it is also requesting support from non-traditional partners, including the international business community.</p> <p>According to the <a href="http://fts.unocha.org/reports/daily/ocha_R5_A1060___1410171321.pdf" title="">UN financial tracking service</a> (pdf), the World Bank leads donor contributions to the overall needs and requirements plan, with 27.8% of the total, followed by the US with 23.8%, the African Development Bank with 12%, and private individuals and organisations with 9.2%. The UK’s contribution accounts for 4.3% of the total, Germany stands at 3.8%, and Cerf has committed 3.7%. Australia has contributed 3.4%, with the European commission accounting for 2.8%.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2014/oct/17/big-pharma-interest-rich-people-sick <p>The giant pharmaceutical company <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/glaxosmithkline" title="">GlaxoSmithKline</a> said yesterday that its work on a vaccine for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola" title="">Ebola</a> will “come too late” to do anything about the current situation. Even now it is trying to compress trials that would normally take a decade into a year. The impression it gives is that it is working flat out, no holds barred. But hang on a moment. Ebola was discovered back in 1976. What has GlaxoSmithKline been doing since then? Answer: not much.</p> <p>A small clue to why can be found by looking at the stock price of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/22/ebola-treatment-us-canada-tekmira-drugs-authorize" title="">the Canadian-based drugs firm that some investors seem to think is leading the pack on Ebola research</a>. Tekmira shares rose a massive 180% from mid-July to October, with most of the share-price action coming when the virus jumped to Europe and the US.</p> <p>Ebola has been killing people in central and western Africa for at least 38 years – but it’s only when the virus becomes a threat to the developed world that there is seen to be a profit in it. I know it sounds cynical to say it flat out like that – but it sounds cynical because it is. What business case is there for developing drugs to save the lives of poor Africans when they don’t have the money to pay for them? Especially when there is so much more profit to be had in – for instance – giving rich white men erections. As a study in last year’s Lancet showed, of the 336 new drugs developed in the first decade of this century, only four of them were for what are known in jargon as neglected tropical diseases – three for malaria and one for diarrhoea.</p> <p>The point being this: the business model of market-driven big (or even medium-sized) pharma does not work well to address the challenges posed by a virus that ultimately has no respect for geography or bank balance. Some of the developed world’s early interest in Ebola was in whether it could be weaponised. It was said that the Russian biological weapons unit – Biopreparat – had turned Ebola into an aerosol spray.</p> <p>All of which is red meat for conspiracy theorists (like those who tell you that the patent for the Ebola virus is owned by the US government, which is true). But my suspicion is not about shady government actions but about basic capitalist economics. Isn’t it interesting that there is money about to ask scientists to turn a virus into a weapon, but not the money about to ask scientists to find a vaccine? And by the time there’s a market for a vaccine, it’s too late.</p> <p>What better example of what is commonly called market failure – that state of affairs in which market forces do not make for desirable outcomes. Here’s another example: remember Nelson Mandela having to take on the big pharmaceutical companies as thousands of dying South Africans were unable to afford Aids drugs. Apparently, the market-driven economics of health care do not have an answer to a virus that begins in a part of the world where there isn’t much money. And that is often where dangerous viruses begin. Which is precisely why market forces will not be able to save us.</p> <p>Indeed, on the contrary, market-driven healthcare is incentivised to keep us sick. For what profit is there in a healthy population? If everyone were healthy, it would be the job of the pharmaceutical companies to persuade us that we were not well, that certain things about us needed fixing, putting right (even if they didn’t).</p> <p>Its a bit like Friedrich Nietzsche’s criticism of the Christian priest: that the priest first has to poison us into imagining we are unwell – and thus in need of saving – before he can present himself as the cure, as salvation. There is no market for salvation in a sinless world. Of course, big pharma presents itself as evidence-based and scientific. Not at all like Nietzsche’s Christianity. But it’s not the science that calls the tune. It is the stock price. And the stock price goes up when rich people feel threatened.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/two-suspected-ebola-cases-spain-test-negative-disease <p>All four suspected Ebola cases admitted to hospitals in Spain on Thursday have tested negative for the virus in the initial rounds of tests, authorities said on Friday.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/spain-man-posible-ebola-case-madrid-hospital" title="">a passenger on an Air France flight arriving at Madrid’s airport</a> was taken to hospital after he reported a fever and began trembling during the flight. He had travelled from Lagos in Nigeria to Madrid via Paris. He was brought to Madrid’s Carlos III hospital, the designated centre for treating Ebola patients in the city.</p> <p>Another man, who had later travelled in the ambulance that carried Ebola patient Teresa Romero Ramos last week, was also admitted to the hospital after reporting a fever. Health authorities had been monitoring him after it emerged that seven patients were transported in the Romero Ramos ambulance before it was disinfected.</p> <p>On Friday morning, authorities said both the Air France traveller and the patient who had been in the ambulance had tested negative for Ebola in the first round of tests. Both remain in quarantine while authorities wait for the results of the second round of tests.</p> <p>A missionary, recently returned from Liberia, who was also admitted to the hospital on Thursday tested negative on Friday.</p> <p>Fifteen other patients are in isolation in the Carlos III hospital. None of them have shown any symptoms of Ebola to date.</p> <p>Three people have also been placed in quarantine in the Canary Islands. A Red Cross worker recently returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone was sent to a hospital in Tenerife with a fever on Thursday and tested negative on Friday.</p> <p>Spain’s only patient with a confirmed case of Ebola, Teresa Romero Ramos, remains in stable but serious condition. The presence of Ebola in her blood continues to fall, health officials noted, but cautioned that it was too early to say she is out of danger.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/17/public-health-ebola-virus-uk <p>Ebola panic is rife. Makeup artists at the BBC are said to be <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2793696/bbc-ban-guests-ebola-hit-countries-entering-buildings-terrified-staff-fear-catch-disease.html" title="">worried about touching the faces of interviewees from Guinea</a>, a <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/523145/Ebola-school-Ghana-exchange-trip-visit-postpone" title="">school cancelled the visit of a mother and child from Sierra Leone</a> , and rumours and conspiracy theories float through the air in a way that the Ebola virus cannot (it is categorically not airborne).</p> <p>Ask most people and they will probably think Ebola is about to arrive in the UK and is a threat. The first may be true – but it will be a handful of cases, at most – and the second is not. Ebola is not easy to catch. It is transmitted by an exchange of bodily fluids with somebody who is so sick they are vomiting, bleeding or excreting heavily. That puts health workers potentially at risk but very few of the rest of us, and the planned emergency response to any Ebola diagnosis – tracking down and monitoring every contact, just in case – will ensure the risks of spread are minimal.</p> <p>Ebola panic is a global development. It is hard to reassure people when unfounded scare stories are broadcast across the worldwide web. But in several ways this could have been better handled.</p> <p>1. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england" title="">Public Health England</a>, full of expertise on infectious diseases and keeping the public safe, does not have a high enough profile. It talks absolute sense and advises government and journalists, but its voice is not much heard by the general public – and nor do they know what it does. In fact, the expertise on infectious diseases resides in Colindale in north London, in what used to be called the Health Protection Agency, which maybe has a more resonant name when it comes to Ebola. Public Health England is responsible for obesity and smoking cessation and other health issues. It may be a problem that PHE has existed only for the last couple of years. It is not the go-to place for Ebola information for most of the general public.</p> <p>In the US, public health messages are dispensed by the surgeon general, and have been for a long time. Warnings in his name are plastered over cigarette packets. The top item on the surgeon general’s website is Facts about Ebola, with the one line underneath: “The risk of an Ebola outbreak in the US is very low.” It is a simple message, put out by a known authority, with more detail available for those who want to click onwards.</p> <p>2. Politicians have been part of the problem. Public Health England was not in favour of screening people returning from west Africa at ports and airports, and advised ministers so. You cannot detect Ebola virus until somebody has symptoms, which is usually about five days after infection but can be up to 21 days. So taking temperatures at Heathrow is a needle-in-a-haystack exercise. You will be lucky to find anybody who was well enough to board the flight but has become symptomatic on arrival in the UK.</p> <p>Keith Vaz, chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, was one of those who did not listen. Last Thursday, he <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/uk-screening-airports-ebola-symptoms" title="">called for screening</a> to increase public confidence, on the back of the US decision to screen. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, had said there were no plans to screen and the chancellor, George Osborne, said they would screen only if they had medical advice that this was useful – but on Monday the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, announced screening would go ahead. At best, the public gets a very confused message. More probably, this fuels the panic.</p> <p>Hunt has not weighed his words carefully on Ebola. The disease, he said this week, could reach the scale of the Aids epidemic. For Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, and potentially other countries nearby, that is sadly true, although Nigeria and Senegal have tracked down all cases and stopped Ebola in its tracks within their own borders. But many readers of Hunt’s words will be thinking of the UK, the US and Europe. Scary.</p> <p>3. The media have not helped. Hunt’s words were, of course, blasted across the front page of the Times, and were prominent in the Telegraph, the Mail and elsewhere. But the sheer quantity of unsubstantiated and sometimes unchecked stories on Ebola are just as much of a problem. Because people are worried, Ebola stories on newspaper websites get huge numbers of hits. People are certainly looking for information. It is a disservice, however, to ramp up and run every minor scare.</p> <p>Maybe we need a trusted voice on Ebola and public health generally. Members of the <a href="https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/" title="">Royal College of Physicians</a>, anxious about escalating obesity in the UK, urged that there should be an obesity champion and even suggested it could be a member of the royal family. Maybe not, but we need somebody on the public health side with a much higher profile, who must not then be gainsaid by politicians or railroaded by the press into measures that are not justified by any evidence.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-britain-david-cameron-ban-ki-moon <p>Britain has called on world leaders to “wake up” to the crisis posed by the Ebola outbreak and to follow the example of the UK, US and France in providing medical and financial support to countries in West Africa.</p> <p>As the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, chided the international community for paying just $100,000 into his $1bn trust fund to fight Ebola, David Cameron called on other countries to “act in a similar way” to Britain, the US and France.</p> <p>The UK prime minister’s intervention is designed to step up pressure on other EU leaders to agree to increase their contributions to fighting Ebola at an EU summit in Brussels next week. It is felt that Germany could make a greater contribution of cash and medical resources while France has further to go in Guinea to match Britain’s efforts in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>The criticism from Britain came after Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, said he was “bitterly disappointed” with the response of the international community, which would have been different if the crisis had erupted in the west. Annan told BBC Newsnight: “If the crisis had hit some other region it probably would have been handled very differently. In fact, when you look at the evolution of the crisis, the international community really woke up when the disease got to America and Europe.”</p> <p>Ban Ki-Moon said on Thursday night that countries need to take part in a “huge and urgent global response” to Ebola. He said: “I believe that it is time that those other countries who really have the capacity provide financial support and other logistical support. This is quite serious. We need an urgent global response and support.”</p> <p>The UN secretary general expressed severe disappointment that only $100,000 has been sent by one country – Colombia – to his $1bn trust fund. A further $20m has been pledged but not received. A wider UN appeal has received $376m, about 38% of the amount the UN is seeking to raise for that appeal.</p> <p>Speaking at the EU-Asia summit in Milan, David Cameron said: “This is the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation. It’s very likely to affect a number of the countries that are here today. Britain in my view has been leading the way. The action we’re taking in Sierra Leone, where we are committing well over £100m, 750 troops, we are going to be training 800 members of health staff in Sierra Leone, providing 700 beds.</p> <p>“We are doing a huge amount and I think it’s time for other countries to look at their responsibilities and their resources and act in a similar way to what Britain is doing in Sierra Leone, America’s doing in Liberia, France is doing in Guinea. Other countries now need to step forward with the resources and the action Because taking action at source in west Africa, that is the best way to protect all of us here in Europe.”</p> <p>Justine Greening, the UK international development secretary, who said Britain had contributed £125m to Sierra Leone, endorsed the prime minister’s comments as she called on world leaders to “wake up” to the crisis. Britain is supporting Sierra Leone because of its historic ties to its former West African colony. The US and France are focusing on Liberia and Guinea because of their own historic ties to the countries.</p> <p>Greening told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on BBC Radio 4: “I do think Ban Ki-moon is right to say that many more countries need to get involved. We had the World Bank annual meetings last week in Washington. I was there making those points. I had the chance to meet directly with Ban Ki-moon and we discussed the need for the international community to now step up to the plate.</p> <p>“It is simply not going to be a tenable approach to simply leave the UK to work with Sierra Leone, to leave the US to work with Liberia, France to work with Guinea and no other countries to get involved. It is fair to say there is now movement. Germany is starting to provide funding. It is quite right to say that the international community now needs to wake up to this crisis and start putting resources into working with the UK and the US in particular to help deliver our strategy which we believe will be successful. We do need resourcing.”</p> <p>The naval vessel Royal Fleet Auxiliary Argus, with 100 medical beds, will be leaving Falmouth for Sierra Leone on Friday. Capt David Eagles said the beds would not be used to treat Ebola victims in Sierra Leone. He told the Today programme: “Our hospital facility is not for the Ebola patients themselves, but it’s to provide reassurance to the UK military and civilian personnel operating in Sierra Leone in support of the DFID [Department for International Development] mission, that if they have a non-Ebola injury, they will have facilities identical to what they would find in a UK NHS hospital off the shore on UK sovereign territory.</p> <p>“We also have the ability to screen our personnel returning from duties ashore, so anyone who has been on shore in Sierra Leone will be screened and monitored on their return, and if anybody had inadvertently been in contact with an Ebola patient, we have a process in place that will see them isolated and returned ashore to the dedicated Ebola treatment units in very short order. I’m confident we have a safe system.</p> <p>“It would serve no purpose to bring Ebola patients out to the ship. The purpose of the DFID mission is to increase the number of Ebola treatment units and Ebola beds and training ashore in Sierra Leone, and as such we are supporting that mission rather than actually using the hospital for Ebola patients. To bring them on board a ship would lead to all manner of complications.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/oct/17/beat-ebola-outbreak-bureaucrats-bureaucracy <p>If I asked you to name the most important things we need in order to tackle the Ebola outbreak, I bet “bureaucrats” would come pretty far down your list. Doctors, nurses, beds, protective equipment, public information campaigns, diagnostic labs and many more would all spring to mind before the bureaucrat. But without bureaucrats and bureaucracy, we won’t beat Ebola.</p> <p>Bureaucracy has a bad name, conjuring images of pettiness and obstructionism and the rubber stamp permanently set to “declined”. It sounds slow, resistant to change, obsessed with procedure rather than progress. But my organisation, the <a href="http://www.africagovernance.org/africa" title="">Africa Governance Initiative</a> has teams working inside the governments at the centre of the Ebola crisis – Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea – and what they are seeing is that effective bureaucracy is central to ending Ebola. We’ve seen what our government colleagues are grappling with every day. So I want to make the case for the bureaucrat, even in emergency situations like the one in west Africa.</p> <p>I should say that by bureaucracy I don’t mean endless meetings and form-filling (although actually even they turn out to have their place). What I mean by a bureaucrat is a public servant who can oversee and manage something. And what I mean by bureaucracy is systems and processes to make decisions and coordinate actions. From our perspective on the government side of the Ebola response, I’ve seen three things that make me think bureaucracy matters.</p> <p>First, the response to Ebola is as much a coordination challenge as it is a medical one. There is a huge number of actors working on different aspects of Ebola. One official from the <a href="http://www.un.org/ebolaresponse/mission.shtml" title="">United Nations mission for Ebola emergency response</a> official recently told us that Ebola is the most complex emergency he’s ever seen. Without proper systems of coordination, like the Emergency Operations Centre in Sierra Leone or the Incident Management System in Liberia, there is a real danger of duplication, delay or muddle, ultimately leading to a less effective response and lives being lost. Effective bureaucracy – a clear hierarchy for decision-making and the sharing of information, for example – saves lives.</p> <p>Second, without decent systems, it’s hard to provide leadership to the fight against Ebola. At times of crises, political leaders need to take the reins. But they will struggle to do so without the right advice and information at their fingertips. So, for example, in Liberia, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf chairs a weekly meeting with the major players on the Ebola response – her key government officials, the United Nations, the US government and the Africa Union. That seems obvious, but it takes effective bureaucracy to oil the machinery of leadership, to make sure that the right meeting happens at the right time, with the right expertise and information available and systems to follow-up on decisions. Behind every great leader there is a great bureaucracy.</p> <p>Third, we will defeat Ebola with data before drugs. Without decent information on Ebola cases, it’s virtually impossible to manage the response, and decent information needs decent systems to collect it. That’s why my colleague <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qbtHiEoi5w" title="">Victoria Parkinson’s work with the government</a> in Sierra Leone’s Ebola call centre is so important. We need to know how many cases of Ebola we have where, for two reasons: to send medical help where it is needed; and to plan the response, so we know how many beds and doctors are needed today and in the weeks ahead. The gathering of data, including form-filling (even if it’s done electronically), is central to the response effort.</p> <p>I have worked with the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea for a number of years now, and I know, with fast enough and big enough support from the international community, they will get Ebola under control. There will be many heroes in that story, the Liberian, Sierra Leonean and Guinean public servants who are working behind the scenes to organise things – the bureaucrats – should count among them.</p> <p><em>• Andy Ratcliffe is director of strategy and development at the </em><a href="https://twitter.com/tonyblair_agi" title=""><em>Africa Governance Initiative</em></a></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/ebola-gambia-africa-tourism <p>Omar Jarju looks out across a row of empty sunbeds around the Djeliba hotel’s perfectly maintained pool, a few steps from the palm-fringed Kololi beach on the Gambia’s Atlantic coast. “Every day in my inbox I get emails from clients, who tell me they’ve been warned not to come,” he says, despondently. “They say ‘Omar do you have Ebola?’ and I say ‘Oh for God’s sake, no!’. Ebola is killing us, whether we have it or not.”</p> <p>This week is only the start of the Gambia’s tourist season but Jarju, manager at the Djeliba, says the hotel is only 47% full, compared with 67% last year. Headlines about the rapid spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea are having a serious knock-on effect for other countries in the continent, according to the Gambia’s ministry of tourism. The number of tourists could be down by as much as 50-60% this season in the Gambia, according to Benjamin Roberts, the tourism minister.</p> <p>That could have devastating implications for a country with half of its population living <a href="http://www.theodora.com/wfbcurrent/gambia_the/gambia_the_economy.html" title="">under the poverty line</a>. “When the international media talk about Ebola they say ‘West Africa’ – it’s bundled together as one area or even one country. So, even though the Gambia is Ebola free, operators are facing cancellations,” he says. “The people who are hit hardest are those at the bottom, the workers who rely on tourists for their livelihood and to feed their families.” The government has strategies in place to keep the country free of Ebola – and make sure people know it is a safe place to go, he says. The ministry is working with tour operators, and a video showing visitors arriving in the Gambia and their testimonies is expected on YouTube next week.</p> <p>Tourism accounts for about 16% of the Gambia’s GDP and directly employs 35,000 people with the same number again employed indirectly by the industry. It is the second biggest source of foreign currency in the nation – vital for the purchase of key imports such as rice. Recent years have hit the country hard, food crop pests and drought have led the UN to warn that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/01/us-foundation-gambia-hunger-ebola-idUSKCN0HQ3KR20141001" title="">200,000 people among the 1.8m population need urgent food assistance</a>.</p> <p>Everyone is feeling the squeeze, under the blazing October sun that has succeeded the rains. Lugging a bag of bracelets, scarfs and trinkets along the beach, Kida Sanu, 35, explains that she supports herself, her sister and her four children. “I sell some trinkets, we get rice, school books. I don’t sell – we don’t have.” It is only the start of the tourist season but, even so, business is slow. “This year is very poor, there are very few tourists around – this time last year it was much busier,” she says. “It’s all this Ebola – but here is safe, tourists come, tourists go – no Ebola.”</p> <p>David Barry, 38 has been operating his juice stall, selling freshly squeezed orange, lime and baobab juice, for 15 years. He reckons there are only a quarter of the normal number of tourists for the time of year. “It’s only the start of the season, so I hope more will come,” he says. “I think the ones who come year after year will come again. They know how important it is to us, but it is the new ones I worry about. Maybe they will stay away.”</p> <p>The Gambian government insists that all possible measures to prevent an occurrence of Ebola in the country have been taken. Omar Sey, the health minister, explains that Ebola screening has been introduced at all borders, <a href="http://www.pura.gm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=5:latest-news&amp;layout=blog&amp;Itemid=58" title="">a 24-hour toll-free telephone helpline was open</a> and the public were being told how to recognise the signs of Ebola – through the training of local chiefs, radio stations, plays, posters, text messages and <a href="http://vimeo.com/108650573" title="">a social media campaign</a> under the hash tag #EbolaFreeGambia. “We are speaking to schools, the heads of every village, to elders and young people,” says Sey. “It is working, the message is getting across – we have the systems in place.”</p> <p>Ministers also note that Senegal, which controlled a possible outbreak of Ebola announced on 17 October and <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/14-october-2014/en/" title="">looks set to be declared free of Ebola by WHO</a>, surrounds Gambia, putting an extra border between the country and danger.</p> <p>Sanu, slinging her bag onto her back, hopes enough has been done. “If we get a case then yes, it is scary for tourism,” she says. “But also we will also be scared for ourselves.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/17/downing-street-ebola-panic-politics-of-fear-sars-bird-flu <p>No one can tell me if Ebola is the worst plague since, variously, Aids, Sars, BSE or the black death. All I hear is that it “might” be. I do not mind being told no one knows. But what do I make of a prime minister who emerges from his Cobra bunker and declares “a very serious threat to the UK”, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/obama-ebola-international-threat-european-leaders" title="">a US president who says</a> it is “spiralling out of control”, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/oct/16/ebola-outbreak-texas-hospital-apologises-over-infections-as-uk-army-medics-travel-to-sierra-leone-live-updates" title="">a World Health Organisation that says</a> it is “the most severe health emergency seen in modern times … a potential threat of an unparalleled human catastrophe”?</p> <p>We have lost control of the language of proportion. The result is an outbreak of crying-wolf syndrome. David Cameron and his cabinet currently tell me to be scared witless by Ebola, an attack from Isis, a resurgent Russia and global warming (sometimes). In July, the prime minister said we face being <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/02/cameron-superbugs-dark-ages-medicine" title="">“cast back into the dark ages of medicine”</a> because of a new strain of superbugs. This was capped two months later when Stephen Hawking declared that <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2746727/Maybe-shouldn-t-looking-quite-hard-God-particle-destroy-universe-warns-Stephen-Hawking.html" title="">“the God particle could destroy the universe”.</a> In small print it said this was “very unlikely”, but how unlikely is very?</p> <p>Is this all scientific drivel, or merely abuse of the sacred word “could”? We have no tools for assessing such threats. There is no help from the Office for National Statistics or Office for Budget Responsibility. Tim Harford of the BBC Radio 4 programme More or Less tries to keep his head above the sea of tosh. But the only sane response is total scepticism of the motives of those seeking to make us afraid.</p> <p>The real threat from Ebola, the subject of agonising coverage from Africa and panic measures from governments, is hard to assess. It has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28262541" title="">been around since the 1970s</a>. It was eventually contained each time, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo earlier this year. If governments really thought it so terrifying they would issue a temporary ban on air travel which, in the digital age, is almost all non-essential. But when fear is in the air and politicians want to seem in control, who can tell?</p> <p>The one sure pandemic is panic. In 1997 we were told that bird flu could kill 2 billion people worldwide. In 1999 European Union scientists wailed that the illness BSE/CJD <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/873026.stm" title="">could kill 500,000 people</a>. It peaked at <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs180/en/" title="">28 deaths in the UK</a> and is down to two a year. The Sars outbreak of 2003 was asserted by one expert as having <a href="http://www.infowars.com/swine-flu-hysteria-spreads-faster-than-actual-virus/" title="">“a 25% chance of killing tens of millions”</a>. The press headlined Sars as “a plague worse than Aids”. One Briton possibly died from Sars last year.</p> <p>The recent flus classed as H1N1 and H5N1 seemed to arrive as regularly as swallows in summer. All were eagerly labelled pandemics by scientists, apparently to unlock millions of pounds in government drugs purchases. In 2006, bird flu was declared “the first pandemic of the 21st century” (others not having come up to scratch). The WHO, penetrated by big pharma advisers, issued a statement that “one  in four Britons could die”. They did not.</p> <p>By 2009, flu scares were on autopilot. “This could really explode,” a BBC reporter wailed of the latest arrival. “It is here,” cried the London Evening Standard, with fear “spreading like a Mexican wave”. The Department of Health’s Sir Liam Donaldson famously declared that <a href="http://lvnch.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/07/21/the_swine_flu_bump_in_the_road_to_mecca" title="">“65,000 could die”</a>. Drugs companies such as Roche and GSK were showered with gold, with a staggering $2bn eventually being spent worldwide on Tamiflu. One of the few official bodies to call the scaremongering to account, the Council of Europe, called the hyping of the 2009 pandemic “one of the great medical scandals of the century”.</p> <p>Health scares are classics of the politics of fear. After a while they lose all force, except to distort medical priorities. Hundreds died of hospital-caught infections while ministers panicked over bird flu. But what are we to do? As with fear of terrorism, crime, poverty or common illness, we have to rely on authority to advise and warn us. When authority has a vested interest in alarmism, anarchy reigns. We are at the mercy of the lobbyist, the spin doctor and the headline writer.</p> <p>The lunacies of medical catastrophism are one thing. The political exploitation of personal insecurity is more serious. We can take an aspirin to ward off mad science disease but we cannot altogether dismiss a minister who claims to know our lives and livelihoods are at risk. I expect the police to guard me from danger without constantly telling me what the danger is. Why do politicians behave otherwise?</p> <p>The political scientist Louise Richardson wrote in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/09/shopping.politics2" title="">What Terrorists Want</a> that it is precisely what western politicians seem happiest to give them: they want to make us fear them. “By declaring war on terror,” she says, “far from denying al-Qaida its objectives we are conceding its objectives. That is why a war on terror can never be won.” It is a terminological admission of defeat.</p> <p>Fear is the dumbing down of politics. After 9/11, Americans were made very afraid of planes. They duly took to their cars and an extra <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/05/september-11-road-deaths" title="">1,500 died as a result</a>. Privately promoted catastrophe has always had a good press. Bookshops are crammed with titles such as The Long Emergency, The Population Bomb, Our Final Hour. The fact that Aids, predicted to slash by a third Africa’s population, has simply not done so, will no more dent the appeal of Armageddon than will the wilder claims of climate changers. The political psychologist Philip Tetlock famously gathered 28,000 predictions from scientists and other experts, then waited and found they were no better than random guesses.</p> <p>Perhaps the answer is to take a leaf from the Office for Budget Responsibility. The government should appoint a commission for the assessment of panics. Its job would be to test alarmist announcements against stringent statistical probability. If a budget can be independently audited and crime figures independently scrutinised, why not Downing Street scaremongering?</p> <p>What is the real risk of thousands dying of flu or being blown up by terrorists? Should we be very scared, seriously scared or scared out of our minds? What force should these words convey to the body politic?</p> <p>My commission would test for the abuse of words such as “could”, “might”, “up to”, as in “Isis terrorism could threaten up to a thousand lives”, or “superbugs could take us back to the dark ages”. The new press regulator, Ipso, would do likewise for that equal offender, the media. Penalties would be harsh, such as a year’s course in regression analysis and probability theory.</p> <p>A democracy must know what it should fear. Perhaps young people who did not know the cold war threat of nuclear annihilation are more susceptible to the phoney scaremongering of today. Either way, it lays them open to lobbyists and cynics. Freedom from fear is a human right. We pay politicians to guard us from terror by not terrifying us.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/texas-healthcare-workers-ebola-public <p>Healthcare workers deemed to be at risk of contracting Ebola after dealing with a patient who died from the virus in Texas are being asked to sign voluntary agreements to stay away from the public, after Dallas authorities decided against declaring a state of emergency.<br /></p> <p>Seventy-five staff members from Texas Health Presbyterian hospital are being given a “binding legal document and order” that states they will avoid public transport, not go to areas where large numbers of people congregate, and continue to be monitored twice a day for symptoms, county judge Clay Jenkins said on Thursday.</p> <p>Any of those involved in the care of Thomas Eric Duncan who refuse to sign the agreement would be subject to a legal control order, Jenkins told reporters after a meeting of the county commissioners court in downtown Dallas. “All the remedies of the law are available,” he said. However he said he believed this would not be necessary. “These are hometown healthcare heroes,” he said. “They’re not going to jail.”</p> <p>It was unclear how long the agreements would be in force. After first suggesting that all 75 healthcare workers had approved them, Jenkins conceded that the wording had only just been finalised, and that some of the 75 may have learned of it from watching broadcasts of the commissioners meeting. “This is clearly not the way I wanted it to go,” he said.</p> <p>The healthcare workers will also have their home addresses flagged on the internal systems of emergency services, said Jenkins, adding that this would prompt first responders responding to calls from their houses to raise an alarm. The flags would disappear when they are no longer at risk of Ebola.</p> <p>The new measure was implemented amid sharp criticism over Amber Vinson, the second nurse to be diagnosed with Ebola after treating Duncan, being permitted to take commercial flights between Texas and Ohio despite already experiencing a fever. Vinson, 29, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/ebola-nurse-transferred-texas-maryland-special-unit">has been transferred to a facility in Atlanta</a> for treatment. Nina Pham, the first nurse to be diagnosed, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/ebola-second-texas-nurse-transferred-atlanta">is being treated in Maryland</a>.</p> <p>In all, more than 135 people – including the 75 healthcare workers, 48 other people who had contact with Duncan before he entered hospital, and a number of people Vinson encountered in Ohio – are being monitored for signs of Ebola.</p> <p>Jenkins announced the voluntary agreements after surprising the audience for the commissioners meeting by saying that he would not be declaring a state of emergency because of Ebola. A proposal for him to declare such an emergency was the sole stated reason for convening Thursday’s emergency meeting.</p> <p>The proposal, published in advance awaiting Jenkins’s signature, called for “extraordinary measures” necessary because Dallas “has the potential to suffer widespread or severe damage, injury, loss or threat of life resulting from the Ebola virus.” However, the motion was abruptly ignored and Jenkins announced the meeting had become “a public discussion”.</p> <p>“At this point we don’t feel that it’s necessary to take extraordinary powers, because we were able to do everything through our partnership with the city of Dallas, the state of Texas and the federal government,” Jenkins said afterwards.</p> <p>Jenkins, who as county judge is the highest-ranking elected official in Dallas county, indicated that the decision had been taken following consultations with other officials including Rick Perry, the Republican governor of Texas, who returned from a visit to Europe to help deal with the situation.</p> <p>Referring to the wide-ranging powers that he would have been handed to control the movement of people into, out of and within the county, and to evacuate Dallas if necessary, Jenkins said: “That’s not what America is about. I don’t want those powers vested in me, and neither does Governor Perry.”</p> <p>Jenkins chided the operators of the hospital for failing to prevent infections among its staff. He said he would begin working from inside the hospital in a unified command structure alongside Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials.</p> <p>“The buck has to stop with somebody, so the buck will stop with me,” said Jenkins, amid ongoing complaints that no one figure has emerged to lead Dallas’ response to the virus.</p> <p>Zachary Thompson, the county’s health director, told the meeting that the voluntary agreements with the healthcare workers must “give the cities a comfort level that the 75 are contained”, adding: “We need to be clear and transparent to the public that we don’t hear a new number”.</p> <p>Two of the four county commissioners signalled to the Guardian just hours before the meeting that they were in favour of the emergency declaration, which they said would also have made it easier for the county to obtain state and federal funding for its response to the crisis.</p> <p>“This is still evolving and the only way we can get reimbursed as a county is to make this declaration,” said John Wiley Price, the commissioner for district three, who promptly backtracked once the meeting had begun following delays while the commissioners held discussions backstage.</p> <p>“I think it’s important that we be reimbursed but that can’t be my focus right now,” said Jenkins. “Public safety has to be priority number one”.</p> <p>District four commissioner Dr Elba Garcia, whose chief of staff said before the meeting that she, too, wanted a state of emergency declared, said from the stage: “At this point I agree with Commissioner Price that the emergency declaration is a tool in the toolbox. I’m going to be very honest with you: I was ready to vote for it. But I think we should put it back in the toolbox.”</p> <p>Both Dr Theresa Daniel and Mike Cantrell, the other two county commissioners, along with Mike Rawlings, the mayor of Dallas, said from the stage that they agreed with the decision not to declare an emergency. Asked afterwards why the emergency meeting had been convened at all, Jenkins told reporters: “You’ll have to ask the commissioners.”</p>

We do not have to leave the door open to all travel to and from hot zones in western Africa while Ebola is an unwelcome and dangerous stowaway on these flights.”</p> <p>An <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/220964-list-lawmakers-backing-travel-ban">unofficial list</a> created by The Hill claimed 34 Republicans and five Democrats have already declared themselves in favour of travel bans.<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/220964-list-lawmakers-backing-travel-ban"> </a></p> <p>The border protection officer John Wagner told the hearing that there are no direct flights from Sierra Leone, Guinea or Liberia to the US, meaning that any quarantine measures would have to apply to passengers travelling via other countries.</p> <p>Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), testified at length that any such travel restrictions would encourage travellers from Africa to hide their travel information and make it harder to check them for fevers when they arrive in the US.</p> <p>“We want to make sure that individuals who are travelling to the United States are monitored … and screened appropriately,” added the White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, in a separate daily media briefing.</p> <p>But in comments to reporters the FAA administrator, Michael Huerta, suggested there was still an ongoing debate within the administration on whether to change the policy in response to growing fears about the risk of Ebola transmission within the US.</p> <p>“We are now working together and assessing this on a daily basis,” Huerta said at an event in Washington. “CDC’s determination is that a travel ban in and of itself doesn’t address the challenges that we have here,” he added. “But this is something that we continue to monitor.”</p> <p>Asked if he had discussed a ban with the White House, Frieden said, “We have had discussions on the issue of travel to and from west Africa.” He added that he would not rule out a ban entirely, saying: “From the CDC’s perspective we will consider anything that will increase the safety of Americans.”</p> <p>Screening measures introduced on 11 October at JFK airport in New York have led to eight passengers undergoing testing there. Similar systems were put in place at Dulles outside Washington DC, Newark and Chicago airports on Thursday.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/16/ebola-nurses-walk-off-job <p>Cyndi Krahne is a nurse. Since <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola">the first Ebola patient died in the US</a>, she has not worn her work shoes in the car. When she gets home, she follows a careful ritual in her garage: taking off her scrubs, stepping gingerly out of her shoes. She carefully wraps them in plastic and puts them in an out-of-the-way place where they won’t touch anything. The shoes and the scrubs never make it into the house.</p> <p>In a week when <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/16/apples-iphone-and-the-iconic-consumer-designs-that-never-change">Dallas is considering declaring itself an Ebola disaster zone</a>, nurses are nervous. <br /></p> <p>Krahne has five children. “I am concerned. I don’t want them exposed,” she says. She’s seen infectious diseases before in the 10 years she has worked at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center Santa Rosa, California. She’s been careful – but never this diligent. <br /></p> <p>Fear is the reason for her conscientiousness. Krahne says she doesn’t feel safe at work. She is still without training or protective equipment. Krahne’s confidence is wavering that her workplace is as dedicated to her safety and well-being as she is. <br /></p> <p>“We haven’t received any education, nor do we have proper personal protective equipment to care for patients with Ebola,” she says. “Because we pushed the issue, we are beginning to get leaflets and they say there are a couple days of training that’s recommended, it’s not mandatory. Speaking for my facility, I personally have not received any notification of training and neither have my coworkers.”</p> <p>A lot of workers who have to come into contact with Ebola share her concerns. Their worries about potential exposure continue to grow, especially among those working on the front lines like nurses and airplane cleaners, who worry that they are not being properly equipped to deal with the situation. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/dallas-nurses-accuse-hospital-sloppy-safety-ebola">A leader of National Nurses United revealed that</a> nurses are forced to improvise dangerously at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital; some used medical tape to secure the openings of their gowns to prevent exposure. Airport employees are, in some cases, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/airline-cabin-cleaners-strike-over-ebola-fears-at-laguardia-airport">walking off the job</a>. <br /></p> <p>The Nurses Union has previously raised concerns over preparedness of hospitals when it comes to treating potential Ebola patients. <a href="http://www.nationalnursesunited.org/press/entry/national-nurse-survey-shows-hospitals-still-not-prepared-for-us-ebola/">Before the Dallas Ebola incidents, the union released a survey of 700 nurses</a> that found that 80% of them had received no communication from their hospital regarding any policy dealing with potential patients infected by Ebola and 87% were provided no education on the disease with the opportunity to ask questions. A third of them said that their hospital did not have sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment like face shields and impermeable gowns. </p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="104ac1361ec4b65be37732dd3a77f78035dce4ed"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/16/1413462832508/d4d38789-07d6-47fb-ad70-53fbe7ce447c-460x276.jpeg" alt="US Money nurses ebola " width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Four out of five nurses say their hospitals have yet to communicate with them about treating potential Ebola patients. </span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: National Nurses United</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The employers in these cases assume that individuals will make supreme sacrifices in the course of employment. And they do make significant sacrifices, but if it’s life or flight, many workers choose flight,” says Michael LeRoy, <a href="http://www.law.illinois.edu/faculty/profile/michaelleroy">a professor of labor and employment relations at the University of Illinois.</a></p> <p>This week, two US nurses were diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas after having been part of the 77-member team that took care of Thomas Eric Duncan, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan">the first person in America to die in the recent Ebola outbreak</a>. <br /></p> <p>Officially, US leaders including President Barack Obama and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) chief Tom Frieden have gone to lengths to reassure the American public that their risk of contracting the disease is low. Obama said he “shook hands with, hugged and kissed” nurses working with Ebola patients at Emory University hospital in Atlanta. <br /></p> <p>Yet even Frieden appeared to concede the fears about Ebola are not entirely unfounded. “It’s scary and getting it right is really important because the stakes are so high,” Frieden <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/ebola-texas-healthcare-worker-virus">said at a press conference</a> about Nina Pham, the first nurse to contract the disease in the US.</p> <p>The law is thin on protecting people from workplace hazards having to do with infectious diseases. Workers’ rights are limited outside of demanding more training and better equipment. <br /></p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="8871720027eab2e5581f7277b5c1d62d457e03a0"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/15/1413413107848/6f2139e0-8e23-4167-921e-2b1ce84370d5-460x307.jpeg" alt="US Money Obama Ebola " width="460" height="307" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Obama and Health and Human Services secretary Sylvia Burwell, speak to the media about Ebola.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The CDC has issued guidance that tells workers what their protections are, but it’s voluntary and not enforceable. <br /></p> <p>The Occupational Safety Health Act of 1970 – better known as OSHA – outlines employers’ responsibilities in maintaining a safe and healthy workplace, but Ebola is not something the law’s provisions on blood-borne pathogens could have predicted. <br /></p> <p>“We think of OSHA standards as the minimum wage of safety and health. Employers can do better if they want,” says Mark Catlin, occupational health and safety director for the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU. <br /></p> <p>The result: unions like the SEIU are stepping in to let workers who may be exposed to Ebola know their rights.<br /></p> <p>The California Nurse’s Association has held press conferences. The SEIU held a training session at a Clarion Hotel across the road from LaGuardia airport in New York. </p> <p>“[The training] wasn’t meant to replace the training that those employers of those airport workers need to do,” explains Catlin, SEIU’s occupational health and safety director. “It was done because we heard that the workers weren’t getting training or having knowledge about what was expected and what was in the CDC guidance that applied to their work and to them.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="f4bc2b471e7d755fe4aec572d1ea6e6f9e39133f"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/15/1413413409089/a46b3102-cc77-49b3-b0ed-36c8f4a8dfd1-460x307.jpeg" alt="US Money La Guardia ebola" width="460" height="307" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">A protester holds up a sign during a one-day strike by airline cabin cleaners demanding more protection in the fight against Ebola.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Power in Numbers</h2> <p>If conditions are bad enough, or the equipment inadequate enough, nurses could walk off the job – a tactic highly discouraged by unions but which remains within the realm of possibility. </p> <p>Workers who are members of the SEIU or the National Nurses Association can recruit these organizations to lobby with their employers on their behalf. What’s more, if workers walk off the job as a united front, instead of doing it as an individual act of protest, there is less likelihood of disciplinary action from their employers.</p> <p>“Workers in this country have a limited right to refuse dangerous work under federal OSHA. In certain circumstances, they aren’t supposed to outright refuse to work, they refuse to do the specific task that they deem to be dangerous,” explains Catlin. <br /></p> <p>“It’s not a very strong right. We urge workers to work through their union because a lot of time workers who refuse the dangerous work can lose their jobs and not get them back. “</p> <p>There are ways to get around this, says LeRoy, the Illinois University law professor. Rather than show up for work, employees who are afraid to come to work could call in sick and start using up their sick days.</p> <p>“It’s always an individual’s prerogative whether they are going to go to work,” says Katharine Parker, partner at the law firm <a href="http://www.proskauer.com/">Proskauer</a>, adding that some workers might be risking disciplinary action if they don’t show up or don’t give enough notices.</p> <p>“If the employer is not following what the CDC is saying, then the employee should raise that as a concern. Most employers will want to engage in a dialogue to address those concerns. Employers want to have a safe workplace, and so do employees.”</p> <p>Calling in sick to avoid work could also result in disciplinary action, or even termination. In some states, if a manager has a reasonable suspicion that the employee is not actually sick, they can ask him or her to produce a doctor’s note, says Parker.</p> <p>While nurses are fearful for their personal safety, they are also concerned with the safety of their communities and their patients, says Krahne. </p> <p>“There may be some nurses who don’t want to come to work, but overall – nurses, we take care of people,” she insists. “We go into situations where other people would never go and so the majority of us are going to be there for our patients.” <br /></p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="b9df6cdbddfa1afde1b6440da06feb652b029ce0"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/16/1413480334281/292a45a3-c6ca-4c26-b691-7233ad99746e-460x328.jpeg" alt="Bentley" width="460" height="328" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Bentley, the one-year-old King Charles Spaniel belonging to Nina Pham, the nurse who contracted Ebola. </span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The fear factor</h2> <p>Yet first responders also have families and fear for their safety. “The fear factor is the number-one employment-related matter that first responders don’t pay attention to,” says LeRoy. </p> <p> LeRoy points to simulation of a three-day smallpox attack in Oklahoma City just before 9/11 that found that 20% of of healthcare workers would fail to report to work due to a fear of contamination. <br /></p> <p>By discounting the fear factor in circumstances such as these, those in charge of planning often underestimate absenteeism that might occur if there is a wider outbreak.</p> <p>“Employers who have employees reasonably anticipated to come into contact with blood or pathogens have to document that they have solicited input from frontline workers in identifying, evaluating and implementing appropriate work practice controls,” says Parker.</p> <p>It is this dialogue between executives and workers that many workers say has been missing in the current handling of the situation. </p> <p>“Managers and supervisors need to listen better to front line responders. The front line responder is a subject matter expert and even if their science isn’t as good as the planners’, the fact of the matter is if they don’t feel comfortable doing their job, they are simply going to refuse doing their job,” says LeRoy. “It’s critical and it’s simple: there has to be bottom up listening instead of top down direction. It has to be a two way communication flow.”</p> <p>Specifically, the hospitals and employers should focus on the most elementary things like more masks, more training, more education and more upfront talking about work refusal. </p> <p>“Those hard talks never took place in those simulations and planners learned from that,” LeRoy says, adding quickly, “Or they claimed to. Whether that’s been put in practice or not, I don’t know.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/ebola-vaccine-peter-piot-west-africa-epidemic <p>The Ebola epidemic, which is out of control in three countries and directly threatening 15 others, may not end until the world has a vaccine against the disease, according to one of the scientists who discovered the virus.</p> <p>Professor Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it would not have been difficult to contain the outbreak if those on the ground and the UN had acted promptly earlier this year. “Something that is easy to control got completely out of hand,” said Piot, who was part of a team that identified the causes of the first outbreak of Ebola in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo, in 1976 and helped bring it to an end.</p> <p>The scale of the epidemic in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea means that isolation, care and tracing and monitoring contacts, which have worked before, will not halt the spread. “It may be that we have to wait for a vaccine to stop the epidemic,” he said.</p> <p>On Thursday night, a Downing Street spokesman said a meeting of the government’s emergency response committee, Cobra, was told the chief medical officer still believed the risk to the UK remained low.</p> <p>“There was a discussion over the need for the international community to do much more to support the fight against the disease in the region,” the spokesman said. “This included greater coordination of the international effort, an increase in the amount of spending and more support for international workers who were, or who were considering, working in the region. The prime minister set out that he wanted to make progress on these issues at the European council next week.”</p> <p>Dr Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), in evidence to Congress, said he was confident the outbreak would be checked in the US, but stressed the need to halt the raging west African epidemic.</p> <p>“There are no shortcuts in the control of Ebola and it is not easy to control it. To protect the United States we need to stop it at its source,” he said.</p> <p>“One of the things I fear about Ebola is that it could spread more widely in Africa. If this were to happen it could become a threat to our health system and the healthcare we give for a long time to come.”</p> <p>There are three vaccines now being fast-tracked through early safety trials in volunteers in the UK, the US and in unaffected Mali to ensure that they do no harm. The results should be available by the end of November or start of December. If they are acceptable, it is likely that healthcare workers – who are at highest risk of being infected and over 200 of whom have died – will be offered a vaccination before Christmas. But the only proof that any of them works will be if there is a significant drop in the number of deaths among vaccinated people on the front line.</p> <p>“If the epidemic is not going to be stopped in these three countries, it will definitely spread to adjacent countries such as Ivory Coast, Guinea Bissau and Mali,” said Piot.</p> <p>He was speaking at a seminar in Oxford as the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned that 15 countries, neighbouring or trading with those where the epidemic is raging, were at risk. They are Ivory Coast, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Senegal, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Mauritania, Nigeria, South Sudan and Togo. Nigeria and Senegal have both succeeded in halting an outbreak. Nonetheless, Dr Isabelle Nuttall of the WHO said all needed to be better prepared. “The objective is to stop the transmission from occurring in these countries. They may have a case but after one case we don’t want more cases,” she said at a briefing.</p> <p>By the end of the week, she predicted, the number of cases will have risen to over 9,000, with more than 4,500 deaths.</p> <p>“It could lead to major destabilisation of societies and also political destabilisation,” said Piot. “It is going to come at a very high cost. Some countries are very vulnerable. The economic impact is already enormous – just as Sars a decade ago only killed 700, but the economic impact was tens of billions of dollars.</p> <p>“My concern is that, as so often after a war or crisis, we say never again and then we forget about it.”</p> <p>Piot said he thought the prospects for an effective vaccine were good. The three candidates had shown good results in animal trials. Piot is chairing a WHO scientific committee on Ebola, looking at who to vaccinate and how and at what dose. He said he was optimistic, but the manufacturers would have to boost their production capacity and massive vaccination campaigns would have to be organised.</p> <p>In written testimony to the House of Representatives, however, Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), was cautious about the progress being made on drugs and vaccines. “While NIAID is an active participant in the global effort to address the public health emergency occurring in west Africa, it is important to recognise that we are still in the early stages of understanding how infection with the Ebola virus can be treated and prevented,” he said.</p> <p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warned that around 120,000 women could die in childbirth within the next year in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea because of the breakdown of healthcare and fears of contracting Ebola in hospital. It estimates that 800,000 women will give birth in the next 12 months, of whom 120,000 may suffer complications and need lifesaving emergency care.</p> <p>“The reality is that pregnant women are facing a double threat – dying from Ebola and from pregnancy or childbirth, due to the devastating impact of Ebola on health workers and health systems,” said UNFPA executive director, Dr Babatunde Osotimehin.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 17 October 2014 to change the word “with” to “without” in the caption.<br /></p>

However, if the players do come into contact with anyone who recently travelled to or from west Africa they are instructed to tell team doctors immediately. </p> <p>“I think guys might think twice if they were planning to bring their wives or their families with them on a trip like this, because why take a chance?” said cornerback Prince Amukamara. </p> <p>“But I think the team is doing a good job making sure we have all of the information we need.”</p> <p>The full letter from experts to NFL doctors and trainers was published in full by <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/10/15/experts-tell-nfl-teams-not-to-panic-over-ebola/17319825/">USA Today</a>.

I appreciate everything that my coworkers have done to care for me at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. I’m doing really well thanks to this team, which is the best in the world. I believe in my talented coworkers. I am #presbyproud!”</p> <p>In a separate statement the hospital said transferring Pham to the NIH facility is “the right decision”.</p> <p>“With many of the medical professionals who would normally staff the intensive care unit sidelined for continuous monitoring, it is in the best interest of the hospital employees, nurses, physicians and the community to give the hospital an opportunity to prepare for whatever comes next,” it said. </p> <p>Pham’s colleague, Amber Vinson, was transferred to Atlanta on Wednesday after testing positive for Ebola. Both women contracted Ebola while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who died last week. </p> <p>Vinson, 29, tested positive for Ebola a day after she flew on a commercial flight from Cleveland, Ohio, to Dallas with a low-grade temperature. Vinson, who was self-monitoring for signs and symptoms of Ebola after treating Duncan, contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) before boarding her flight to Ohio, and was allowed to proceed. </p> <p>Vinson’s temperature was 99.5F (37.5C) before boarding the flight on 13 October, the CDC director, Tom Frieden, said on Wednesday. But since that was below the CDC’s temperature threshold of 100.4F, she is believed to have posed very little risk to those around her. Meanwhile, the CDC and Frontier airlines are scrambling to contact and interview all 132 passengers aboard her flight.</p> <p>Several schools in Ohio and Texas have closed so health officials can disinfect the buildings after learning that staff or students may have been on the same plane, although possibly not on the same flight. A school district in central Texas said on Twitter that three of its schools would be closed, and two children who were on the same flight as Vinson have been asked to stay home and monitor their temperatures for 21 days.</p> <p>Earlier on Thursday, a nurse at the Dallas hospital who treated her co-worker Pham after she tested positive for Ebola on Sunday <a href="http://www.today.com/health/dallas-nurse-we-never-talked-about-ebola-thomas-eric-duncan-2D80220579">told the Today show’s Matt Lauer</a> that the hospital did not adequately protect staff in the days leading up to Duncan’s diagnosis.</p> <p>“I watched them violate basic principles of nursing,” Briana Aguirre said in an interview that aired on Thursday. “I would try anything and everything to refuse to go there to be treated. I would feel at risk by going there. If I don’t actually have Ebola, I may contract it there.”</p> <p>Aguirre said she did not treat Duncan, but she said she spoke with co-workers who did.</p> <p>“It was just a little chaotic scene. Our infectious disease department was contacted to ask, ‘What is our protocol?’ And their answer was: ‘We don’t know. We’re going to have to call you back,’” she said.</p> <p>Aguirre’s interview aired hours after the hospital hit back at <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/dallas-nurses-accuse-hospital-sloppy-safety-ebola">similar allegations made by National Nurses United</a>, the country’s largest nurses’ union. The hospital categorically rejected most of the claims the union made, apparently on behalf of anonymous healthcare workers at Texas Health Presbyterian, about the hospital not protecting its staff after Duncan was diagnosed, saying it was always in step with CDC protocol. </p>
http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2014/oct/16/ebola-crisis-a-heroic-chris-brown-shares-his-views-with-the-world <p>Lost in Showbiz likes to think of itself as a paragon of modesty and shy understatement. It would never seek to self-aggrandise by claiming that it exerts a vast influence over the world of celebrity, that the famous hang on its every word, looking to it for guidance much as they would a guru or oracle, regarding its pronouncements as wisdom, spun from the purest gold, there to be acted upon with alacrity.</p> <p>But sometimes, it does wonder. Last week, Lost in Showbiz found itself forced to berate the world’s celebrities for their woefully inadequate response to the Ebola outbreak. It noted sorrowfully that, to date, hardly anyone from the glittering showbiz firmament had done or said anything idiotic. Apparently forgetting themselves – and the vital role they’re supposed to play in any crisis – they had chosen to make a sober black and white fundraising video. Clearly panicked and desperate, people had taken matters into their own hands and resorted to making idiotic things up, about R&amp;B singer <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2014/oct/09/ebola-crisis-worlds-celebrities-kim-kardashian-akon" title="">Akon performing in a giant plastic anti-Ebola bubble</a> etc.</p> <p>Among the celebrities Lost in Showbiz called upon to act was R&amp;B’s best-loved domestic abuser Chris Brown, a man who suggested the 2011 riots might be quelled if people listened to his recent collaboration with pop-house DJ Benny Benassi, Beautiful People. It’s delighted to report that no sooner were its admonishing words published than a suitably chastened Chris Brown took to Twitter and informed his 13.7 million followers that, in his considered opinion, the Ebola epidemic was, in fact, “<a href="https://twitter.com/chrisbrown/status/521556459696312321" title="">a form of population control</a>”. No word, alas, as to whether he meant that it was the judgment of God upon an over-populated world or a crisis engineered by shadowy operatives of The Man – just the suggestion that “shit is getting crazy” – but let’s not pick nits here. Let us instead offer profound thanks that at least one celebrity has started doing their job properly, and hope that others follow his lead and buck their ideas up.</p> <p>Indeed, the only drawback to the situation was that, 9,500 retweets later, Brown suggested he was going to “shut up”. Lost in Showbiz can only clasp its head in its hands. No, Chris Brown! Don’t shut up! At the moment, you’re our only hope! Indeed, at risk of abusing its position as your guru or oracle – its pronouncements of purest spun gold to be acted upon with alacrity – Lost in Showbiz commands you to say more stupid things! Have you any thoughts on the advance of Islamic State?</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/ebola-congress-hearing-cdc-director <p>The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that Ebola is like a “forest fire” that can reignite at any point if all embers are not extinguished, as politicians in Washington prepared to criticise initial mistakes made in responding to its spread in the US.<br /></p> <p>In <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF02/20141016/102718/HHRG-113-IF02-Wstate-FriedenT-20141016.pdf">prepared testimony</a> ahead of a hearing of a House of Representatives oversight committee, Thomas Frieden pointed to the temporary re-emergence of the disease in Nigeria as a sign of what happens if contact tracing protocols are not fully followed.</p> <p>“It will take meticulous work and we cannot take short cuts,” he said. “It’s like fighting a forest fire: leave behind one burning ember, one case undetected, and the epidemic could reignite.”<br /></p> <p>“In response to the case in Nigeria, 10 CDC staff and 40 top CDC-trained Nigerian epidemiologists rapidly deployed, identified, and followed 1,000 contacts for 21 days,” added Frieden. “Even with these resources, one case was missed, which resulted in a new cluster of cases in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. However, due to the meticulous work done in Nigeria, no new cases have been identified, and the outbreak appears to have been extinguished there.”</p> <p>The danger of mistakes is expected to be underlined by the congressmen on the House commerce committee, whose oversight branch is holding the first hearings on the US response on Thursday.</p> <p>“We cannot afford to look back and say we could have done more,” said the full committee chairman, Fred Upton, in<a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/press-release/committee-continues-oversight-ebola-outbreak#sthash.rz25NWcd.dpuf"> a statement ahead of the hearing</a>. “The Ebola outbreak is a global public health issue that demands an all-hands-on-deck response.</p> <p>Other witnesses included Daniel Varga, the chief clinical officer at the Dallas hospital that first treated cases in the US, whose remote testimony included an apology for its handling of the incident.</p> <p><a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF02/20141016/102718/HHRG-113-IF02-Wstate-VargaD-20141016.pdf">In pre-submitted evidence</a>, he revealed how the temperature of the first patient Eric Duncan had spiked to 103F during his first visit to the emergency department, yet he was still sent home.</p> <p>Other <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF02/20141016/102718/HHRG-113-IF02-Wstate-FauciA-20141016.pdf">witness testimony </a>submitted by the National Institutes of Health described the lengths that drug companies were now going to in order to find a cure or vaccine for Ebola, but Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) warned that they were still some distance from producing sufficient quantities for widespread trials.</p> <p>“While NIAID is an active participant in the global effort to address the public health emergency occurring in west Africa, it is important to recognise that we are still in the early stages of understanding how infection with the Ebola virus can be treated and prevented,” he said.</p> <p>“As we continue to expedite research while enforcing high safety and efficacy standards, the implementation of the public health measures already known to contain prior Ebola virus outbreaks and the implementation of treatment strategies such as fluid and electrolyte replacement are essential to preventing additional infections, treating those already infected, protecting healthcare providers, and ultimately bringing this epidemic to an end.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/16/ebola-text-messaging-combat-outbreak <p>Text messaging is playing a vital role in Sierra Leone’s fight against Ebola as more people use their mobile phones to send information about food security to aid agencies and to receive free public health alerts.</p> <p>The Word Food Programme (WFP) last month started <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/WFP%20mVAM%20Special%20Ebola%20Bulletin%20%231%20-%20Sierra%20Leone,%20September%202014.pdf" title="">a new drive to reach Sierra Leoneans by text message</a> in an effort to source information about household food security. Ebola is ravaging rural economies, agricultural activities and markets in west Africa and straining food supplies, <a href="http://www.fao.org/emergencies/fao-in-action/stories/stories-detail/en/c/253935/" title="">according to the Food and Agricultural Organisation</a>.</p> <p>More than 850 people have responded to a survey about food supplies in Sierra Leone, the WFP revealed. The survey quizzed people on the prices they are paying for food and livestock as well as their strategies for coping with stretched food supplies. “Over 80% of respondents in the east report consuming less expensive food, while three quarters report reducing the number of meals and limiting portion sizes,” the WFP said.</p> <p>Jean-Martin Bauer, a food security analyst at the WFP, said: “This is a good source to get a quick update on information, but of course there’s a lot more going on than just mobile services in terms of food security assessments in those three countries.</p> <p>“We are doing these surveys in Guinea and Liberia as well. Our idea is not to do a one-off; this is a system that we’re setting up. We know that Ebola is a dynamic phenomenon and it’s changed a lot in the past few months and we need to be able to track its impact on household food security.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-7805c68a-b163-43c6-9596-57e38c96382b"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/16/1413473499927/111dab59-263f-493b-8831-3208e680cbea-460x276.jpeg" alt="BBC information service" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">The BBC is utilising a range of mediums to convey information about Ebola to people in countries affected by the virus.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bauer said that monthly rounds of mobile-phone surveys about food security are planned in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. “As Ebola changes, we need to be able to have an update so that we can adjust our response,” he said.</p> <p>But the WFP cautioned that SMS surveys do not reach everyone in Sierra Leone, which in 2012 had a <a href="http://www.gsma.com/publicpolicy/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/SSA_FullReport_v6.1_clean.pdf" title="">mobile penetration rate of only 48%</a> (pdf), according to the GSM Association.</p> <p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-29573964" title="">On Thursday, the BBC started sending text alerts</a>, short audio clips and low-resolution photos to people threatened by Ebola.

http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/16/morocco-africa-cup-of-nations-ebola-withdraw <p>The venue for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations finals is in major doubt after the proposed hosts, Morocco, reiterated its fears over the Ebola outbreak on the continent.</p> <p>The Confederation of African Football (Caf) received a letter from the Moroccan government last week asking for the tournament to be called off and had <a href="http://www.cafonline.com/en-US/NewsCenter/News/NewsDetails?id=D1lozWSZ8RJEFgm6iR31DA%3D%3D" title="">agreed to discuss the plans</a> at the next executive committee meeting on 2 November. The prospective hosts proposed either postponing the tournament until next year or allowing them to switch to the 2017 edition instead.</p> <p>However, despite reports on <a href="http://www.supersport.com/football/africa-cup-of-nations/news/141016/Morocco_withdraw_as_2015_hosts" title="">the African website supersport.com</a> which quoted a source from the country’s ministry of sport on Thursday claiming that Morocco has now officially withdrawn in order to “preserve the safety of our citizens”, the sports minister, Mohamed Ouzzine, moved to clarify the situation on Thursday but admitted they will follow the recommendations of the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>“Our concern is the health of Africa and, based on WHO reports and guidelines, we have to listen,” Ouzzine said. “Zero safety does not exist, but one has to take the necessary precautions so that the coming tournament will be a football feast, bringing together our African brothers. But given the current Ebola situation we don’t think such a feast can take place as expected.</p> <p>“We are talking about the Africa Cup of Nations where we are expecting between 200,000 and 400,000, even one million spectators to converge in Morocco. I don’t think there is any state or any country that has the necessary capabilities to monitor, check and control the current Ebola situation when faced with these numbers.</p> <p>“This is our real problem. We don’t have a problem with visiting teams, we have a problem with visitors.”</p> <p>Ouzzine added: “If there are fears about the loss of funding and financial commitments, we can always find solutions to these issues – but today is not the day to discuss these things.</p> <p>“We will discuss these things when we meet with Caf – and we might even debate other options. But I beg you, what’s the significance of the financial losses compared to human losses? A human being is priceless. I can tell you that we will reach a definite decision during our meeting with our brothers from Caf.”</p> <p>The 2013 hosts South Africa are now tipped to take over after reports that the country’s Football Association was already in negotiations with Caf, although Sudan and Egypt have also expressed an interest in hosting the tournament.</p> <p>Ghana’s sports minister, Mahama Ayariga, confirmed they are also considering a request from Caf to take over hosting duties.</p> <p>“The Confederation of African Football has officially asked Ghana to consider hosting the 2015 African Cup of Nations if Morocco drops its bid to host the tournament. The government of Ghana is considering this call,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hon.mahamaayariga?fref=nf" title="">he wrote on Facebook</a>.</p> <p>“Caf also indicated that it was firm on the tournament dates but they will meet the Moroccan authorities and take a decision at that meeting,” Ayariga added in an interview <a href="http://www.citifmonline.com/2014/10/16/caf-write-to-ghana-to-host-afcon-2015-if-morocco-pullout/" title="">with Ghanaian radio station Citi FM</a>.</p> <p>“But in the meantime they are writing to a number of countries that they think have the capacity to be an alternative venue in the event of Morocco actually pulling out.”</p> <p>Morocco’s withdrawal could lead to sanctions from the governing body, with potential punishments including the suspension of their national teams and clubs.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/ebola-second-texas-nurse-transferred-atlanta <p>The second nurse diagnosed with Ebola in Texas was transferred from Dallas to a special bio-containment unit in Atlanta, officials announced on Wednesday, as they acknowledged failings in the response to the arrival of the virus in the US.</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also said that the 29-year-old nurse, Amber Vinson, flew on a commercial flight from Cleveland, Ohio to Dallas with a low-grade temperature a day before she was diagnosed. While in Ohio, she also reportedly travelled from Cleveland to Akron. </p> <p>Concerns about the US response to the crisis intensified on Wednesday night when it was reported that Vinson told the CDC that she had a slight fever before she boarded the flight but was not told to stay put. </p> <p>Citing a federal source, CNN reported that the nurse said she had a temperature of 99.5F (37.5C) before boarding the flight on 13 October. But since that was below the CDC’s temperature threshold of 100.4F, “she was not told not to fly”. </p> <p>Vinson is the second healthcare worker to have contracted Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/dallas">Dallas</a>, which treated <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/thomas-eric-duncan-liberia-ebola-war-texas-family-obituary">Thomas Eric Duncan</a>, a Liberian who was the first patient in the US to be diagnosed with Ebola. Another nurse, 26-year-old Nina Pham, was diagnosed at the weekend.

Everyone working on this challenge - from the medical professionals at the bedside to the public health officials addressing containment of the infection - is working to end the threat posed by this disease.”<br /></p> <p>According to Frieden, the two nurses who contracted Ebola in Dallas had “extensive” contact with Duncan in the days before he was diagnosed, when he was extremely ill, excreting large quantities of highly contagious body fluids. <br /></p> <p>“Our investigation increasingly suggests that the first several days before the patient was diagnosed appear to be the highest-risk period,” Frieden said.</p> <p>Information from medical records suggested that the team of healthcare workers who treated Duncan had exposed skin while working in the quarantine unit during the three-day window between when he was admitted and when he was diagnosed.<br /></p> <p>“Were protocols breached? The nurses say there were no protocols,” said National Nurses United co-president Deborah Burger in a call with reporters Wednesday.</p> <p>Burger said nurses who work at Texas Health Presbyterian reported that Duncan was not immediately placed in isolation upon his arrival at the hospital on 28 September. They said Duncan, who at that point was very ill, was left for several hours in an area where other patients were present. </p> <p>Burger also said the union was told the nurses who initially treated Duncan wore only generic gowns, three pairs of gloves and surgical masks, and were not given surgical booties. They had the option to wear a full-face mask, but one was not initially required.</p> <p>The nurses said they were eventually given better gowns, but the garments still exposed their necks, part of their heads and their scrubs from the knees down. To protect the exposed parts of their body, the nurses said, they were instructed to wrap medical tape around their necks. It is not clear what healthcare workers treating patients suspected or confirmed to have Ebola in Dallas are currently required to wear.</p> <p>In a letter addressed to Obama, the union asked him to take executive action to keep nurses and all healthcare workers safe. They’re asking that every healthcare worker be required to wear a Hazmat suit when treating an Ebola patient, and for hospitals where they are being treated to be compelled to meet the same standards of care as the nation’s special bio-containment centers. </p> <p>The 77 healthcare workers who worked in the quarantine room with Duncan or handled samples of his blood were initially instructed to monitor themselves for symptoms, Frieden said. After Pham was diagnosed, the healthcare workers were placed under more aggressive monitoring, which requires a twice daily temperature check by a public health official. At that point, Vinson had already left Texas and traveled to Ohio. </p> <p>Frieden said three people who may have made direct contact with Vinson have been identified and are being actively monitored. Officials are also monitoring one person who may have made direct contact with Pham, as well as her dog.<br /></p> <p>Pham was in “improved condition” Wednesday, according to Frieden, while Vinson was “ill but clinically stable”.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/obama-ebola-international-threat-european-leaders <p>Barack Obama has warned of Ebola spreading globally if more is not done to stop the epidemic raging out of control in west Africa, as he urged the US public not to lose sight of the importance of focusing on tackling the disease at its source.</p> <p>As pressure grows on the White House to explain failures to prevent <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/ebola-second-texas-nurse-transferred-atlanta">a second case of transmission</a> within the US, the president announced a “rapid response Swat team” from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would aim to respond to any further infections within 24 hours “to take local hospitals step by step through what needs to be done”.</p> <p>The president also cancelled a trip to Rhode Island and New York on Thursday to focus on his administration’s response to domestic cases of Ebola, the White House said late on Wednesday. </p> <p>“I am absolutely confident that we can prevent a serious outbreak of the disease here in the United States, but it becomes more difficult to do so if this epidemic of Ebola rages out of control in west Africa. If it does, then it will spread globally in an age of frequent travel and the kind of constant interactions that people have across borders,” he told reporters after an emergency two-hour meeting of his cabinet.<br /></p> <p>The administration is under growing political pressure over its handling of the crisis after the CDC admitted “shortcomings” in its initial response to the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/nina-pham-ebola-texas-nurse-well-hospital-condition">first confirmed US case in Dallas</a>, admitting it should have done more to ensure the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/dallas-nurses-accuse-hospital-sloppy-safety-ebola">hospital was following infection-control protocols</a>. An infection of a second health worker was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/ebola-second-texas-nurse-transferred-atlanta">confirmed</a> on Wednesday.<br /></p> <p>On Wednesday, Obama stressed that though protecting healthcare workers was a top priority, the risks of transmission should not be overstated:<br /></p> <p> “I want to use myself as an example so people have a sense of the science here. I shook hands with, hugged and kissed – not the doctors – but a couple of the nurses at Emory because of the valiant work that they did in treating one of the patients. They followed the protocols, they knew what they were doing and I felt perfectly safe doing so. This is not a situation like the flu where the risks of a rapid spread of the disease are imminent.”</p> <p>Earlier, the president declared Ebola a “threat to international security” in a video conference with European leaders.<br /></p> <p>Speaking with leaders in the UK, France, Germany and Italy shortly after the case was confirmed on Wednesday, the US president said they all urgently needed to marshal extra finances and personnel to “bend the curve of the epidemic” in west Africa.<br /></p> <p>But the White House rejected growing calls for greater restrictions on passengers travelling from the region, insisting travel bans were “not on the table” at present and would prove counter-productive by hampering local aid efforts.<br /></p> <p>The House speaker, John Boehner, <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/press-release/boehner-travel-ban-should-be-considered-president-ebola-crisis-worsens">urged the president </a>to review that policy on Wednesday. “A temporary ban on travel to the United States from countries afflicted with the virus is something that the president should absolutely consider along with any other appropriate actions as doubts about the security of our air travel systems grow,” he said.</p> <p>The White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, resisted calls for a single “Ebola czar” to be placed in charge of the federal response on Wednesday, claiming “people should be encouraged that the government is demonstrating a tenacious adaptive response [to Ebola]” among a range of federal agencies.<br /></p> <p>“We have designated very clear lines of responsibility in terms of which agencies are responsible for which aspects of this response,” he added.</p> <p>Nonetheless, political criticism is expected to grow on Thursday when a committee of the House of Representatives convenes the first public hearing into recent developments.</p> <p>Republican Tim Murphy, chairman of the oversight and investigations subcommittee, said “so far traveller self-reported screening procedures and hospital infection control measures have been demonstrated failures” in a statement issued ahead of Thursday’s testimony from the CDC director, Tom Frieden.</p> <p>White House officials acknowledge failures in the initial response and said a “very concerned” Obama had cancelled travel plans and convened an urgent meeting with cabinet members on Wednesday to make sure federal agencies were properly coordinated.</p> <p>“It is unacceptable that even one healthcare worker was exposed to this virus while they were providing medical treatment to this patient. So that is an indication that there were shortcomings,” Earnest told reporters in a White House press briefing dominated by the crisis.</p> <p>However, he rejected suggestions that the multiple transmissions among health workers in Dallas constituted an “outbreak” of the disease, insisting that the risk of the disease spreading in the general public in the US remained “extremely unlikely”.</p> <p>In Texas, officials were preparing to transfer <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/ebola-second-texas-nurse-transferred-atlanta">the second nurse diagnosed with Ebola</a> to a special bio-containment unit in Atlanta, hours after it was revealed that she had travelled on a commercial flight to Ohio with a low-grade temperature before she was diagnosed. </p>

We’re always moving quickly behind the target but we’re now trying to beat it.”<br /><br />With the food pipeline beginning to open up and the WFP bringing in large shipments this month and next, Crisci believes it will have the capacity to respond to the needs of up to 600,000 people.<br /><br />But he does not underestimate the scale of the emergency. Last week, while on an assessment mission to a village 45 miles from Freetown that had been placed in isolation, he came across a quarantined house guarded by soldiers.<br /><br />“Behind them on the patio, covered with a coloured cotton sheet were two sisters, probably about two and nine years old. One was face up and one was face down. Their mother was there on the patio, keeping a distance of couple of metres. She was looking over at them and you could see that she was desperate and hopeless. Her hands were tied and she couldn’t do anything to comfort them. She kept on looking out at the road hoping that the ambulance was coming any time. We intervened heavily but unfortunately one of the little girls passed away. The other sister is in a treatment centre now in Port Loko and we hear the chances are slim.<br /><br /> “If it had been a kid who had broken their leg or bumped their head, we’d have thrown them in the WFP car and run to the hospital; we do it all the time. But in a case like this, we couldn’t do anything.

The flights were cancelled and they can’t come back. <br /></p> <p>“The few magistrates who are now sitting don’t hear more than 10 cases a day because the emergency public health declarations say there should not be large gatherings. If you have more cases, you have more people. Before, they’d hear 30 cases a day. Now they’re adjourning cases and they’ve also restricted litigants: it has to be your case and you can’t come with lots of friends and witnesses to support you. Lots of the male prisoners are not in good health and some lawyers are worried about coming across them in the corridors.”<br /><br />Lavaly says the situation in prisons is also becoming increasingly difficult as people’s cases are adjourned. With visits from family suspended, it is left to the NGOs to bring baby food to mothers detained with young children, and to top up the prisons’ ever-dwindling supplies of chlorine, buckets and gloves.<br /><br />“We also bring in a bit of cassava for people, because a lot of time they complain that the don’t have enough food,” says Lavaly. “And God forbid, if you get Ebola, your immune system needs the food – not to mention oral rehydration solution. Even without Ebola, there are a lot of malnourished prisoners.”<br /><br />While it applauds the efforts of those judges and magistrates still managing to do their jobs, AdvocAid wants the police to relieve some of the pressure by dealing with minor offences in the police station rather than clogging up the courts.<br /><br />But what it most needed, argues Lavaly, is neither a fast-tracked legal process nor a judicial airdrop, but international help in bringing a swift end to the crisis.<br /><br />“Many of us lived through the war,” she says. “It feels like we are back in that time again, but only it is worse. Then, we could see our enemy but now the enemy is unknown and could be a loved one or close associate. Then, the international community and relatives overseas were sympathetic to our plight and readily gave financial and moral support. Now we feel like a pariah nation, closed from the outside world and with not much sympathy for our plight as no one wants to contract Ebola from us.”<br /></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-543e766ae4b03829d13c1fca" class="block"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-15T14:28:49.254+01:00">2.28pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Here’s a photo of the Dallas apartment block where the second healthcare worker to contract Ebola lived.

Its next goal is to raise £50,000 to supply 50,000 meals to those in hospital in Sierra Leone’s western region, including patients, nurses, doctors, drivers and others.<br /><br />She talks also about the strong sense of community among the Sierra Leone diaspora in the UK.<br /><br />“Everybody who is on the front line should at least be able to get meal,” she said.<br />“The idea is that we free up the Ministry of Health and Sanitisation so that they don’t have to worry about that part of the struggle. This is a very complex situation and we are all battling to get things going.”<br /><br />The campaign - Lunch Is On Me - launches this Saturday.

Earlier this week they promised training to anyone who might come in contact with Ebola, from doctors to firefighters, and said they would enlist the help of groups such as Doctors Without Borders in developing the training. </p> <p>After experts from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control raised concerns about the layout of Madrid’s designated hospital for treating Ebola, emergency renovations have begun at the Carlos III Hospital. The tiny change rooms, which sparked concerns over infections when health workers are taking off the protective suits, are being expanded. Video cameras have been installed to catch any slip-ups in protocol. </p> <p>The improvements come after <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-spanish-health-workers-poor-training-virus">months of lobbying by health workers</a>. In July, more than 100 nurses brought a complaint before a judge over their “lack of training and knowledge regarding Ebola protocols.” The virus was spreading in Africa, and the nurses worried it would only be a matter of time before it reached Spain. For many of them, training had simply been a 10- or 20-minute demonstration, said the unions representing health workers. </p> <p>Their worries turned out to be well-found when one month later, the Spanish government decided to repatriate a 75-year-old Ebola patient from Liberia. A second patient was brought in September from Sierra Leone. Both men died days after arriving in Madrid. </p> <p>After a nurse who attended to both patients <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/06/nurse-spain-tests-positive-ebola">became the first known person to contact Ebola outside of west Africa</a> last week, health workers again began lobbying for better training and equipment to fight the virus. </p> <p> Teresa Romero Ramos remains in stable but serious condition. Another 15 people remain in quarantine in the Carlos III Hospital, none of whom have shown any symptoms of Ebola to-date.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-543e675be4b0ebfb2a1bf20a" class="block is-key-event"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-15T13:26:43.705+01:00">1.26pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">'Chaotic scenes' described at Dallas hospital</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20141015-in-statement-nurses-at-presbyterian-dallas-describe-confused-response-to-ebola-case.ece"><strong>Dallas Morning News</strong> reports</a> that staff at the Texas Health Presbyterian hospital have described chaotic scenes when Thomas Eric Duncan was brought in with Ebola:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p> Nurses at the Dallas hospital where a Liberian man died of Ebola described a confused and chaotic response to his arrival in the emergency room, alleging in a statement on Tuesday that he languished for hours in a room with other patients and that hospital authorities resisted isolating him.</p> <p>In addition, they said, the nurses tending him had flimsy protective gear and no proper training from hospital administrators.</p> <p>The allegations, made under unusual circumstances, provided the first detailed portrait of Thomas Eric Duncan’s second trip to the emergency room, where he arrived by ambulance days after doctors had sent him home with a fever, a headache, abdominal pain and a prescription for antibiotics.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2014-10-15T14:13:18.368+01:00">at 2.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-543e62d9e4b03829d13c1fa2" class="block is-key-event"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-15T13:20:42.433+01:00">1.20pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Dallas press conference</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>City officials in Dallas have been holding a press conference about the new Ebola case.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/15/ebola-outbreak-central-africa-contained <p>As the world has rightly focused on the response to the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola" title="">terrible outbreak of Ebola in West Africa</a>, and the new cases in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-europe-unavoidable-who-spain" title="">Europe</a> and the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/ebola-us-risks-response-first-case" title="">US</a>, another unrelated Ebola outbreak has taken place in the Equateur province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/25/ebola-outbreak-congo-confirms-disease-cases" title="">It began in August</a> in the village of Ikanamongo and, as with all other outbreaks, was triggered when the Ebola virus crossed the species barrier between animals and humans and infected one person before spreading to others.</p> <p>It is thought that the first person to contract the virus in Ikanamongo was a woman, infected while butchering wild game to cook for a family meal. The outbreak caused around 70 infections and 43 deaths. But, unlike in West Africa, the last known case occurred around three weeks ago and the outbreak will likely soon be declared fully contained by the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>In today’s globalised world, it is almost certain there will be more Ebola cases reaching Europe and the US – despite the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ebola-screenings-heathrow-airport-mixed-response" title="">airport screening</a> programme launched this week in several countries. Given this, and the fact that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/who-new-ebola-cases-world-health-organisation" title="">current estimates predict the rate of infection will rise</a> to 10,000 cases per week by December, it is vital that the lessons of how to defeat Ebola are learned quickly.</p> <p>Once the DRC outbreak was reported to health officials in Kinshasa, the response was rapid – a team that had contained numerous outbreaks in the past was brought in. It was headed by Jean-Jacques Muyembe, a professor of microbiology and now director of the DRC National Institute of Biomedical Research, who was the first medic to arrive in Yambuku when the first known outbreak occurred in 1976.</p> <p>His team has contained more than 10 outbreaks in the country and, with others in countries such as Uganda, has demonstrated that a rapid and robust response can stop rural outbreaks before they spread to major urban areas and across international borders. In fact, in 1995 the DRC team prevented a potential outbreak in Kinshasa, the capital city with a population of 9 million, when a patient from an <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00037078.htm" title="">outbreak in Kikwit</a>, five hours away by road, made his way to a hospital there.</p> <p>It was at Kikwit that the three basic public health strategies to prevent Ebola outbreaks were tested and proven. They are: rapid identification and isolation of those with the Ebola infection in controlled health facilities where workers are protected; tracing everyone who has been in contact with an infected person and monitoring their temperature for 21 days, with those who develop the Ebola fever isolated at a health facility; and helping local people understand how to protect themselves while providing safe patient transport and burial, and working with village chiefs and elders to help quell rumours about the origins of disease.</p> <p>So what has gone wrong in the current tragic outbreak in West Africa? First, by the time the rural infection was reported it had spread to several communities and the initial response was not robust enough to contain it. Now, urban areas are affected, where community organisation is less structured and effective, and where trust in government is low because of recent civil conflict. At the same time, the health system has collapsed in several areas where health workers have been infected, making it a challenge to ensure patients are isolated from their families.</p> <p>Rumours about what has caused the outbreaks and what is done at healthcare facilities always accompany rural outbreaks, and these have been amplified in urban areas where the virus is now spreading. At the same time, with greater population density and mobility in the cities, tracing contacts and monitoring their temperature has been difficult.</p> <p>It is essential that as many lives as possible are saved while attempts to stop the outbreak are under way. Fluid replacement for those who are sick is essential, orally if possible, then intravenously to keep patients alive so that their immune systems can work to defeat the virus. This alone will be lifesaving in some. At the same time, clinical trials of the candidate vaccines and medicines that have been developed in North America and elsewhere must now be studied in humans.</p> <p>New and innovative ways are already being found to compensate for the weakened public health systems in the three most affected countries. In Sierra Leone, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/19/sierra-leone-three-day-shutdown-ebola-outbreak" title="">people were confined to their homes</a> for a three-day period and information about Ebola was given to more than 70% of the households in outbreak areas. This was controversial: would there be facilities to isolate patients who were identified; would there be burial teams to carry away the dead? But it was accomplished without the dire consequences predicted by many outside the country.</p> <p>Other innovations might include using mobile phones to trace contacts or help people with fever understand where they can report for diagnosis. Another might be modifying community care centres so they can be used for Ebola patients – especially important in providing diagnosis, treatment and isolation of patients whose numbers have surpassed available hospital beds. Muyembe and his teams in the DRC have given protective materials to rural families who insist on keeping patients at home – monitored daily by the outbreak control teams. Though the effectiveness of this method is now being assessed, where it was used rural outbreaks have been successfully contained within months.</p> <p>Support from international partners is rapidly increasing in West Africa – goodwill is abundant – and this is essential for success, even though President Obama declared this week that the world “<a href="http://www.reuters.com/video/2014/10/14/obama-world-is-not-doing-enough-to-conta?videoId=346569829" title="">is not doing enough</a>” to combat the disease. But it is important to remember the lessons from Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. When a major cholera outbreak occurred, the international response was generous, but <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/28/haiti-cholera-earthquake-aid-agencies-failure" title="">much of the coordination was ineffective</a>, resulting in duplication of effort, while gaps in the essential response remained.</p> <p>Despite the early lack of coordination in West Africa, and despite declarations that this outbreak is more difficult to contain because of poverty, recent civil disturbance and war, there is no time for excuses. With support from the UN, government efforts must be strengthened. The errors made in Haiti must not now recur in West Africa, where every day lives continue to be lost.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/uk-landlords-refuse-house-student-sierra-leone-ebola-fears <p>A radio presenter from Sierra Leone who had been broadcasting a myth-busting show about Ebola in his home country was refused accommodation when he arrived to study at the University of East Anglia this month because landlords feared he may have brought the killer virus with him.</p> <p>Amara Bangura, 35, from the capital Freetown, has told the BBC he was refused lodgings by two separate landlords who had been happy to rent him accommodation in Norwich until they saw his passport and found out he was from one of the worst-hit Ebola hotspots.</p> <p>The broadcaster, who had used his weekly radio show in Sierra Leone to dispel myths about the disease, said he was devastated to be turned down.</p> <p>“It’s very unreasonable,” he told the BBC. “And if you think everybody coming from Sierra Leone is affected, then that’s just completely unfair.”</p> <p>One of the landlords reportedly told him in a refusal letter: “Under normal circumstance[s] your profile would be a great profile to be one of our lodgers.</p> <p>“However, given that the world is about to probably experience an Ebola epidemic, we have decided not to accept anyone that has been anywhere near the outbreak within the last two months, or is likely to visit those areas in the near future.”</p> <p>Bangura has now found a place to stay and has given a presentation on the Ebola outbreak in Africa to students at the university.</p> <p>A senior officer at the UEA students’ union said the landlords’ behaviour was “absolutely disgusting”.</p> <p>Holly Staynor, welfare, community and diversity officer at the union, said: “There is no way we should be discriminating against any students.”</p> <p>Bangura’s show is networked to 35 stations across the west African country through BBC Media Action, and aims to educate, inform and warn listeners about the disease.</p> <p>He told the Guardian last week: “You have to deal with the issues of myth, you have to deal with the issues of religion, you have to answer questions about prevention and how to stay safe”.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/15/ebola-funds-disease-outpaces-aid <p>Governments have pledged millions of dollars of aid, volunteer medics are signing up to work on the frontline and individuals are digging into their pockets to address what the World Health Organisation (WHO) calls “unquestionably the most severe acute public health emergency in modern times”. But with death tolls relentlessly rising, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/09/ebola-outbreak-response-breakdown-key-funding-pledges">the biggest donors</a> are increasingly calling on other countries to step up.</p> <p>While there has, so far, been no “naming and shaming” of countries deemed to be dragging their feet, President Barack Obama reiterated on Tuesday that “the world as a whole is not doing enough”.</p> <p>The UN has said it will cost just under $1bn to tackle Ebola over the next six months. On Wednesday, the WHO said $257m had been received, or 26% of what the UN says is needed, with another $162m pledged.</p> <p><a href="https://extranet.who.int/ebola/#/resources">The WHO estimates that it alone will need $260m</a>. It still has a $93m shortfall. One of the greatest challenges, said WHO communications officer Fadela Chaib, is to get treatment centres fully operational and bring in more health workers.</p> <p>“WHO is working closely with governments and partners at the highest level to recruit teams and deploy resources and equipment. But the response is slow. We need 3.3m items of high-quality personal protective equipment and training provision of Ebola treatment centres,” Chaib said. Many countries have provided health workers, including Cuba – with 165 workers sent to Sierra Leone – China, Canada, Russia and Uganda.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Ebola funding per citizen chart">  <iframe src="http://cf.datawrapper.de/6APr9/2/" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen" msallowfullscreen="msallowfullscreen" width="460" height="400"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Marcus Manuel, a senior research associate at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), said initially some G7 countries had seen the Ebola crisis as mainly a problem for countries with historical links to the west African region.</p> <p>“There is an issue of burden-sharing within the G7. That partly reflects long-term historical links that the US has with Liberia and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/crew-british-hospital-ship-sierra-leone-ebola-mission">the UK with Sierra Leone</a> … Now we are seeing that others are realising that this is a global emergency,” he said.</p> <p>One of the unique characteristics of this global emergency is how quickly Ebola is spreading, meaning that estimates of what aid – funds, personnel, equipment – is needed are being outpaced by the spread of the disease, which has already killed about 4,500 people in west Africa. On Tuesday, Dr Bruce Aylward, the WHO’s assistant director general, said the number of new cases was likely to be 5,000-10,000 a week by early December.</p> <p>To illustrate the scale of the needs and the rapidity at which they are changing, Manuel pointed out that British and American plans to build treatment centres in west Africa were unlikely to deliver new beds until mid-December at the earliest. And even then, the total would probably only be about 3,000 beds.</p> <p>“The issue is not just about money,” Manuel said. “The cases keep growing … original estimates quickly run out of time … That’s what’s overwhelming people at the moment. Each person is infecting another two people. That’s the challenge. The numbers don’t add up.”</p> <p>The US and the UK have led the calls for other nations to step forward.</p> <p>“Many countries are already contributing, but the scale of needs is dramatic,” the US secretary of state, John Kerry, said last week. “The US has contributed $113m to the UN response. Smaller countries have stepped up to the plate – some quite remarkably. Some smaller countries are contributing way above their per capita population. But the fact is more countries can and must step up to make their contributions felt … There are not enough countries to make the difference to be able to deal with this crisis. We need more nations – every nation has an ability to do something on this challenge.”</p> <p>Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN, has praised Cuba and Timor-Leste for “punching far above their weight” with their contributions to the global response.</p> <p>“According to the UN’s financial tracking service, only 24 countries have pledged $1m or more to the efforts,” Power told the general assembly last week.</p> <p>The <a href="http://fts.unocha.org/reports/daily/ocha_R10_E16506_asof___1410150300.pdf">UN financial tracking service</a> (pdf) lists funding pledges from countries, philanthropic associations and international bodies such as UN agencies. Notable absentees from the list include Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and Islamic Development Bank are organising a conference on 5 November in Jeddah.</p> <p>Manuel said another issue was that pledges did not always translate into hard cash. There is also concern that amid the plethora of pledges, some funds may be recycled money.</p> <p>The head of the <a href="http://www.afdb.org/en/">African Development Bank</a>, Donald Kaberuka, said on Saturday that <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/ebola-funds-not-repackaged-aid-africa-bank-chief-072224137--business.html">he was worried some donors were repackaging aid money</a>, funnelling it away from other areas in the three countries at the centre for the epidemic.</p> <p>Kaberuka said moving funds from already allocated development projects in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone was unhelpful in the long term and would make their rebuilding harder. He said new money was needed, and criticised the international response as too little, too late.</p> <p>Individuals are also digging into their pockets. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr Priscilla Chan, are donating $25m to the <a href="http://www.cdcfoundation.org/">CDC Foundation</a>, a private non-profit organisation gathering donations for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p> <p>Africa’s richest man, the Nigerian Aliko Dangote, provided about $900,000 to help Nigeria contain the disease, according to the UN list.</p> <p>Across the world, people are also offering to use their medical skills to treat people. The global campaigning organisation Avaaz said on Wednesday that more than 360 doctors, nurses and medical workers were among about 2,000 people who answered its call for qualified volunteers to fight Ebola in west Africa.</p> <p>“This is a stunning outpouring of courage and humanity. But it’s not just admirable, it’s necessary. To overcome Ebola and much more, we need to build a world of care and bravery without borders,” said Ricken Patel, executive director of Avaaz.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/15/ebola-crisis-liberia-peace-building-conflict-pen-pen <p>The Liberian government responded slowly to the Ebola crisis, asking the international community to do <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/06/ebola-liberia-health-funds-africa-summit">what some have argued</a> it should have done itself. Now, there are indicators that the government is dependent on the goodwill of the international community for both manpower and basic supplies.<br /></p> <p>As a result, the most frustrated and marginalised citizens have taken to the streets. In late July, residents in Montserrado county <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201408051258.html">blocked a major highway</a>, demanding that the government remove three dead bodies from their community. Distressed citizens have <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/08/15/340401807/radio-in-liberia-seems-like-its-all-ebola-all-the-time">called in to radio shows</a>, telling how they were forced to sleep in the streets while <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/09/liberia-ebola-bodies_n_5664559.html">waiting for authorities to remove dead bodies</a> from their homes. The government responded by <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201409011222.html">implementing a 9pm-6am curfew</a> to prevent people from coming out at night to throw out bodies or secretly bury their dead. The curfew <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/liberia-modifies-ebola-curfew-hours-lifts-another-quarantine/2443351.html">has been lifted to a degree</a> but many still question the logic behind it. </p> <p>But local organisations have taken matters into their own hands and are engaging in awareness activities to reach out to populations in Monrovia and beyond. One successful local initiative is the <a href="http://buildingpeaceforum.com/2014/09/peacebuilding-with-local-citizens/">Pen-Pen Peace Network</a> which, since the outbreak, has expanded its role from post-civil war peacebuilding to fighting Ebola at the community level. So far, the network has built hand-washing and sanitising stations for citizens, communicated information about Ebola prevention through loudspeakers, and distributed 3,000 factsheets throughout communities.</p> <p>The inclusion of pen-pen (motorcycle taxi) drivers in the fight against Ebola is just the most recent step forward in the drivers’ integration into civilian life since the end of the Liberian civil war. As the country engaged in post-war processes, funds were provided to ex-combatants to disarm and many of them <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/07/world/africa/easy-riders-liberia-bikers/">used these funds to buy motorcycles</a> (pen-pens). </p> <p>Although pen-pen drivers have become valued service providers, they are also often perceived as outcasts. Some have been hired by criminal entities to engage in illicit activity, or by political parties to intimidate and harass opponents during elections. These factors motivated the <a href="http://www.cla.purdue.edu/ppp/">Purdue Peace Project</a> (PPP) to work with pen-pen drivers and community members who regularly interact with them. The Pen-Pen Peace Network was created as an opportunity for drivers, police, the ministry of transport, customers, and community members to talk with each other and develop peace-building strategies.</p> <p>Most recently, the Pen-Pen Peace Network has launched a public awareness campaign in communities within Monrovia to educate citizens about Ebola. Liberia’s ministry of health and social welfare has trained and employed pen-pen drivers to disseminate information on virus transmission and prevention, to encourage safe practices among citizens and fellow drivers, and to attempt to reduce the continued risk of civil unrest against aid workers. The drivers’ ability to speak local dialects helps to address the concerns of distressed citizens. </p> <p>There is evidence to suggest that Pen-Pen Peace Network’s initial post-war peace-building efforts <a href="http://www.cla.purdue.edu/ppp/documents/EbolaCampaignExecutiveSummary%2010.7.14.pdf">have been accepted</a> by community members and this appears to have carried over into their Ebola awareness campaign. Preliminary analysis by the Purdue Peace Project suggests Liberians listen to the drivers’ messages because they are everyday citizens.</p> <p>There are other initiatives addressing Ebola-related violence in Liberia. The <a href="http://lern.ushahidi.com/">Early Warning and Early Response Working Group</a>, a network of local civil society organisations, governments and United Nations representatives, recently launched a campaign in four hard-to-reach counties. The <a href="http://www.irex.org/">International Research &amp; Exchanges Board</a> (IREX) is working to help civil society and media groups organise forums to discuss issues around the Ebola crisis, while urging constructive engagement with the government. </p> <p>Challenges still exist, however, especially in addressing communities outside of Monrovia. There is no clear government support to empower health workers and social mobilisation committees to carry out community-driven response activities beyond the capital. Unless the fight against the spread of Ebola is expanded beyond Monrovia and is fully decentralised to county, district, and community levels, and adequate support is provided to caregivers and health practitioners, many more people will die.</p> <p>This is a sad reality, but initiatives like the Pen-Pen Peace Network drive home the message that local citizens can be effective peacebuilders. The government and its partners should take keen note of this and consider identifying, strengthening, and supporting community-led structures, especially in counties not yet affected by the virus.<br /></p> <p><em>Nat Walker is Liberia correspondent for <a href="http://www.insightonconflict.org/">Insight on Conflict</a>.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/david-cameron-ebola-crisis-barack-obama-eu-leaders <p>David Cameron is to take part in a video conference call on Wednesday afternoon with Barack Obama and EU leaders to discuss the growing Ebola crisis amid warnings that the outbreak could grow to 10,000 new cases a week within two months.</p> <p>As the death toll from the virus reached 4,447 people, nearly all of them in west Africa, Downing Street confirmed that the prime minister would join a conference call with Obama and the leaders of France, Germany and Italy.</p> <p>It is understood that the leaders will discuss what further action can be taken to help stop the spread of the virus in west Africa.</p> <p>They will also discuss the steps that are being taken to screen air passengers arriving in Europe and the EU from west Africa.</p> <p>The news of the conference call came after Dr Bruce Aylward, assistant director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), told a news conference in Geneva that the number of new cases was likely to be between 5,000 and 10,000 a week by early December.</p> <p>Aylward told a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday that the number of new cases was likely to be between 5,000 and 10,000 a week by early December.</p> <p>WHO’s regular updates show that deaths have resulted from 4,447 of the 8,914 reported cases, but Aylward said that any assumption that the death rate was 50% would be wrong. He put the death rate at 70% because many deaths are not reported or recorded officially.</p> <p>Where detailed investigations have been carried out, it was clear that only 30% of people were surviving, he said, adding that the figure was almost exactly the same in the three hardest hit countries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. “This is a high-mortality disease in any circumstances but particularly in these places,” said Aylward, adding that it was not the WHO’s job to judge how different countries responded to the Ebola outbreak.</p> <p>The grim forecast came as the first returning passengers from west Africa to Heathrow airport were asked to undergo temperature checks and questionnaires about their contacts with Ebola patients. The £9m screening exercise has been criticised by some experts, who say it will not pick up those who have the virus but are not yet symptomatic.</p> <p>In the US, it emerged that a nurse who contracted Ebola has been given a blood transfusion from Dr Kent Brantly, who has recovered from the disease. The nurse, Nina Pham, was infected while caring for Thomas Duncan, who was taken ill on a visit from Liberia and died in Texas Health Presbyterian hospital, Dallas.</p> <p>Brantly has donated blood for three Ebola patients, including Pham. “He’s a doctor. That’s what he’s there to do. That’s his heart,” said Jeremy Blume, a spokesman for the non-profit medical mission group Samaritan’s Purse, which Brantly was working for in Liberia. The WHO said plasma from people who had overcome Ebola, which contains antibodies against the virus, should be tried as a treatment, but it is hard to use outside the sophisticated healthcare settings of the west.</p> <p>The US president said on Tuesday night that the “world is not doing enough” to combat the disease, and that “everybody’s going to have to do more than they are doing right now”. Obama said he wants to make sure lessons learned from Pham’s case are applied to health centres around the US.</p> <p>The UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, newly set up to coordinate the fight against the disease, has set targets to isolate 70% of suspected cases in west Africa and safely bury 70% of the dead within the next 60 days – described as the 70-70-60 plan.</p> <p>It is a tough target, said Aylward, but if it takes 90 days rather than 60, “a lot more people will die who shouldn’t and we will need that much more capacity on the ground to manage the caseload”.</p> <p>As the numbers continue to rise, the need for beds and health personnel to treat the sick will increase – and there is a serious shortage of trained and experienced people to lead the effort, according to Aylward.</p> <p>Good training programmes are being put in place, particularly by the UK and the US, “but there is still the challenge of getting internationals on the ground who have expertise – in Ebola ideally”.</p> <p>For the past four weeks, about 1,000 new infections a week – including suspected, confirmed and probable cases – have come to light. Aylward said the WHO was concerned about the continued spread, especially in the capital cities of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia – Freetown, Conakry and Monrovia.</p> <p>“The virus is still moving geographically and escalating in the capitals,” he said. Large treatment centres are taking a long time to build and staff and those that exist are full. A new strategy, which the UK is supporting in Sierra Leone, is to set up a lot of community care units with a handful of beds, where people can stay and get basic care rather than endangering their families at home, while waiting for a treatment centre bed.</p> <p>The units will also help people arriving with fever because they have malaria. At the moment, they are not being treated or are afraid to go to hospital.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/nina-pham-ebola-texas-nurse-well-hospital-condition <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is establishing an Ebola response team that will be immediately dispatched to any hospital with a confirmed case of the disease.</p> <p>At a press briefing on Tuesday, CDC director Tom Frieden conceded that the agency should have sent a larger team to Dallas when Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan">contracted the disease</a> before arriving in the US, tested positive for Ebola two weeks ago. Duncan died in hospital last Wednesday.</p> <p>“That might have prevented this infection,” Frieden said. “Ebola is unfamiliar. It’s scary and getting it right is really important because the stakes are so high,” he added.</p> <p>Frieden said investigators have still not identified the apparent breach in protocol that led to Nina Pham, a nurse who cared for Duncan, contracting the virus. Healthcare workers wore gowns, gloves, masks and face shields when treating Duncan.<br /></p> <p>Regardless, Frieden said enhanced safety measures are already being implemented in Dallas, including the addition of a round-the-clock site manager to help enforce infection control procedures. Two nurses from Emory University hospital in Atlanta, home to one of the nation’s four bio-containment units, were sent to Dallas where they will train hospital staff.</p> <p>The CDC is also recommending that hospitals limit the number of staff involved in an Ebola’s patients care. Pham, 26, was one of 76 healthcare workers at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital who may have come into contact with Duncan or his blood while he was being treated. Pham entered Duncan’s intensive care unit often, and cared for Duncan a day before he died last week, according to medical records.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="67e1b4e1f2a872b4304cdd436308ab9fddd47e42"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/14/1413306575178/345eb2f2-3048-4dea-92ce-4d9c81dfa664-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg" alt="This 2010 photo provided of Nina Pham, 26, who became the first person to contract the disease within the United States.

Pham was admitted to hospital and placed in isolation on Saturday <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/texan-healthcare-worker-ebola-thomas-duncan-us">after reporting a slight fever</a>, the hospital said. The following day, the CDC confirmed that she had tested positive for Ebola. </p> <p>Pham, who has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/dallas-nurse-ebola-transfusion-kent-brantly">received blood plasma</a> from an American, Dr Kent Brantley, who recovered from Ebola earlier this year, said she is “doing well” in a statement released by the hospital on Tuesday.</p> <p>“I’m doing well and want to thank everyone for their kind wishes and prayers,” Pham said. “I am blessed by the support of family and friends and am blessed to be cared for by the best team of doctors and nurses in the world here at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas.”</p> <p>A man who had contact with Pham before she became symptomatic is being “actively monitored” by health officials, as is her dog, Texas health commissioner David Lakey said on Tuesday.</p> <p>The 48 people who are believed to have had varying degrees of contact with Duncan are all still being monitored for symptoms. Frieden said they’ve passed the riskiest period of their 21-day incubation, and an infection at this point would be “unusual”.</p> <p>The deepening Ebola crisis in west Africa has claimed the lives of more than 4,000 people. </p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/ebola-not-another-dustin-hoffman-germ-thriller <p>I must confess: I was initially concerned that I am perhaps not sufficiently qualified to weigh in on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/who-new-ebola-cases-world-health-organisation" title="">our planet’s current Ebola panic</a>, seeing as I am neither a doctor nor a nurse nor a scientist of any kind nor an African fruit bat nor Dustin Hoffman.</p> <p>But then I discovered that singer and odious woman-puncher Chris Brown had recently offered his opinion on the matter (he thinks “this Ebola epidemic is a form of population control”, which is technically true, I guess, though not in the intentional, cosmic way I suspect he means); and so has bleating conspiracy theorist Dinesh D’Souza, who called Obama’s African roots <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DSouzaDinesh/photos/a.279556495404346.96395.216709768355686/968061683220487/?type=1" title="">a “more dangerous infection” than the virus itself</a>; and so has psychiatrist and large animatronic thumb Keith Ablow, who alleged that President Obama <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/10/09/ebola-outbreak-why-obama-is-allowing-ebolaphobia-to-spread/" title="">“may literally believe we should suffer along with less fortunate nations … allowing illegal immigrants and, potentially, even diseases to flow through”</a> – and I realised that I am more qualified to comment than at least three famous idiots who have already inflicted their opinions on millions and millions of people.

The gall.</p> <p>And anyway, there is one area in which I am eminently, objectively pedigreed to comment – relative to famous idiots or not – and that is in my capacity as a human being living in a culture where panic is marketed as both disposable entertainment and a way of life.</p> <p>Realistically, something will wipe us out eventually, though it probably won’t be Ebola. We’re hurtling toward a wall, even if we can’t see what it’s made of or when we’ll hit. Again, I’m not a doctor (so <em>please</em> stop emailing me pictures of your weird toe), but I’m a fairly educated, competent adult and I hate the way we talk about this stuff – like it’s simultaneously the end of the world and just another fun Dustin Hoffman germ-thriller. It’s a dead end. You can’t fix the apocalypse, and there’s no reason to fix fun.</p> <p>Somehow, in America at least, we seem to be taking Ebola both too seriously and not seriously enough. Rightwing xenophobes rage about closing the borders and impeaching #OBOLA (heads up, white Americans: if anyone has a track record of deliberately introducing devastating diseases to the North American continent in order to wipe out the population, it’s not half-Kenyan lawyers), while the rest of us titter proprietarily over <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/09/ebola-africa-paying-price-progress-at-risk" title="">the gory doom that we know will almost certainly never touch us</a>; meanwhile, we’ve skimped on funding infectious disease research ever since the 90s Ebola scare lost its lurid lustre, and healthcare workers are paying the price. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/ebola-ic-research/" title="">As Wired reported on Monday</a>: “If there were more infection-prevention research, the nurse in Dallas (and probably the one in Spain, who may have contaminated herself doffing her gear) might not have become infected.” Not only that, but Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, says that, if it wasn’t for funding cuts, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/12/ebola-vaccine_n_5974148.html" title="">we would probably have an Ebola vaccine by now</a>.</p> <p>Sooo … do we learn from that? Are we going to invest in medical equipment that protects doctors and nurses from contamination? Procedures that minimise human error? Education campaigns about the dangers of antibiotic-resistant bacteria? Or even, um, a functioning healthcare system? Anything constructive? Nah, said John McCain on Sunday. Instead, he suggested, Obama should appoint an Ebola tsar to assuage Americans’ superficial, borderline recreational anxieties about a disease that mainly affects people in west Africa living in extreme poverty without access to clean water and modern medical facilities, along with the underfunded, understaffed medical personnel desperately battling the epidemic. Not to mention the fact that the Obama administration almost certainly has not just appointed officials but entire agencies to contain Ebola in the US (if I learned anything from Outbreak, Rene Russo is also on the case), and that McCain’s party hates tsars, government oversight in general and probably Rene Russo, too.</p> <p>Perhaps John McCain and his cohort ought to invest in a Get a Grip tsar.</p> <p>Or, if he’s genuinely interested in prolonging and enhancing the lives of his constituents, he should advocate for an Influenza tsar, or a Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci tsar, or a Living Wage tsar, or a Forgive My Medical Bills/Student Loans tsar, or a Tell the Police to Stop Murdering Black People tsar. Any of those would be more useful, in the scheme of things. Not that Ebola doesn’t deserve attention – it absolutely does, and fast (and my deepest condolences to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/11/bintu-sannoh-ebola-sierra-leone-eyewitness" title="">every single person who’s been affected</a>) – but it deserves attention centred on west Africa, and not the kind of attention that deliberately whips the public into a panic so that their panic can be used as a political bargaining chip by elderly iguanas while the problems that <a href="http://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/12/ebola-sierra-leone-fighting-war-against-unseen-virus" title="">cause and perpetuate the disease go unaddressed</a>.</p> <p>I will retract my iguana comment when John McCain starts agitating for a Global Clean Water tsar.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ebola-screening-confusion-heathhrow-airport-measures <p>Passengers travelling to the UK from west Africa say they were not given automatic medical checks for Ebola, forcing Downing Street to defend its new screening regime on the first day of operation at Heathrow.</p> <p>Labour urged Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, to get a grip on the situation after there was confusion among travellers and officials about whether it was voluntary for people entering the UK from the worst affected regions to undergo temperature tests and medical checks.</p> <p>On Monday, Hunt told MPs that border officials would have to rely to some extent on people noticing posters about Ebola in airports and presenting themselves to the authorities if they thought they were at risk.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-1125a9a8-7d47-4459-9692-eee5731bc976"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/14/1413312146588/58737e24-6fc2-4d9e-9903-8aad86b461b6-460x276.jpeg" alt="Port of entry Ebola health assessment form" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Port of entry Ebola health assessment form. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2014/oct/14/ebola">See the full version here</a> </span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Katharine Duncan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This appeared to be the case at Heathrow’s Terminal 1, where some travellers expressed bemusement and even shock at the relatively low key nature of the measures, which will cost about £9m over the next six months.</p> <p>A Sierra Leonean journalist who travelled via Brussels from Monrovia, Liberia, said passport control staff only realised where he had come from when he volunteered the information. Sorious Samura said: “I could have just come throughout without any screening. That is how scary it is.</p> <p>“Our flight was met by an airport official saying we might be screened. He even shook our hands. That’s something nobody does now in Liberia and infected countries – you have to learn not to.</p> <p>“Most of the people who had been on our flight from Liberia to Brussels didn’t go into the screening room, they just seemed to go through to customs and presumably out of the airport. I only filled in the questionnaire and went through the screening because I felt a sense of responsibility, having seen the effect of Ebola where I’ve been.”</p>  <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/14/ebola-checks-optional-london-heathrow-airport-video"                        data-show-ads="true"                data-video-id="2175445"                data-video-name="'Why are Ebola checks optional at London's Heathrow airport?' – video"                data-video-provider="ITN"                data-video-poster="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/14/1413297433099/London-Heathrow-Airport-017.jpg"> <video data-media-id="gu-video-449721193" class="gu-video" controls="controls" poster="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/14/1413297420962/London-Heathrow-Airport-007.jpg"> <source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/10/14/141014ebolascreening-16x9.mp4"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/10/14/141014ebolascreening/141014ebolascreening.m3u8"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/10/14/141014ebolascreening_3gpLg16x9.3gp"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/10/14/141014ebolascreening_3gpSml16x9.3gp"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/10/14/141014ebolascreening.webm"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Among others arriving at Heathrow was ReGina Jane Jere, who travels frequently between Africa and her home in London. She said she had noticed little discernible difference during her arrival – apart from the presence of a sign.</p> <p>“I wasn’t stopped. I wasn’t asked any questions. I wasn’t asked where I had come from,” said Jere, who had travelled from Gambia via Dakar and Brussels.</p> <p>“There was a hand sanitiser as you walk in and I did use it, and there is a sign which is not highly visible which says ‘medical check’, which I have not seen before, so at least there is a sign. I travelled to [the capital of Gambia] Banjul on Friday and as I walked into the airport terminal everyone was actually screened and somehow I felt really quite comfortable that I was screened and I was going into a country that was doing that.”</p> <p>Public Health England said passengers on indirect flights from Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone – the three west African countries at the centre of the outbreak – would be automatically flagged at passport control. They would then be escorted to a screening area, where their temperature would be taken and they would fill out forms asking if they had had contact with any Ebola patients, experienced any symptoms of the disease or visited a traditional healer or hospital.</p> <p>Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director of Public Health England, said that screening would not be compulsory, but he expected passengers would agree to it for the sake of their own health.</p> <p>“If they are not cooperative in coming for screening, it is an issue Border Force colleagues will look at,” said Cosford.</p> <p>“There is public health legislation so we can take steps if we believe somebody is a risk to the public’s health and that can lead to them being treated in hospital for the public’s safety.”</p> <p>However, David Cameron’s official spokesman appeared to contradict the idea that screening was not compulsory when pressed on whether the system was doing enough to catch passengers who are potentially at risk of the virus.</p> <p>“They are required to go through the screening process,” he said. “We are taking what I would describe as a robust and proportionate approach to this, based on the very latest medical advice we get.”</p> <p>Speaking on LBC 97.3 radio, Cameron later acknowledged that the screening would “never be perfect” and “we won’t catch everybody”.</p> <p>Labour said it was worrying that just 24 hours after Hunt’s statement to the House of Commons there was confusion over the new screening programme.</p> <p>“The fact that nobody in government seems to know whether the screening is voluntary or not will not build public confidence in the government’s handling of this situation. The government urgently needs to clarify its policy on screening to reassure the public that it has a grip.”</p> <p>Dan O’Mahoney, chief of staff of the Border Force, said there were fewer than 1,000 passengers a month coming into the UK from the three countries.</p> <p>“The vast majority come through Heathrow,” he said. “We don’t anticipate it will require additional staff. The numbers for Border Force are pretty modest.”</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" >  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1413311752320/Ebolia_stats_1510WEB.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Ships that arrive from west Africa will have travelled for more than 21 days before landing in the UK, so anybody incubating the virus would have become ill on board and the authorities would be alerted.</p> <p>In Brussels, where the only direct flights from Sierra Leone to Europe arrive, there is no screening as the government says it has confidence in the screening done before passengers board.</p> <p>However, on Monday it introduced new measures at Brussels airport which means any baggage showing any sign of liquids or food must be destroyed.</p> <p>“We do not want to take the risk, so if we see any fluid in baggage coming from west Africa we destroy it. We are rigorously applying the rule,” said a spokeswoman.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/14/kei-kamara-ebola-sierra-leone-wolves <p>The Sierra Leone striker Kei Kamara believes the Ebola outbreak in his homeland jettisoned his chance of signing for Wolves. Kamara, who spent last season at Middlesbrough, joined MLS side Columbus Crew last week despite a successful trial with Kenny Jackett’s Championship side.</p> <p>The Wolves manager was ready to offer the 30-year-old a short-term deal but the club were unable to secure a work permit for Kamara after Sierra Leone’s ranking dropped outside Fifa’s top 70 nations – a Home Office requirement for all non-European Union players.</p> <p>Having risen to a high of 50th in August, the Confederation of African Football ruled that The Leone Stars must play all of their home matches elsewhere due to the Ebola outbreak.</p> <p>“A few weeks ago I was at Wolverhampton who offered me a contract to play for them and I said yes, but the next minute I found out that my work permit was turned down because of my country Sierra Leone dropping in the Fifa rankings,” Kamara said.</p> <p>“It all came because of the disaster out there at the minute with Ebola. We are not able to play games in Sierra Leone and we play every game away. We lost the last couple of games and dropped in the Fifa rankings so my permit got turned down.</p> <p>“They were all some of the factors but I knew there was a place that I called home, there’s a place I can always prove myself.</p> <p>“[MLS] is one of the best leagues I’ve played in. I’ve played in the Championship and the Premier League and the MLS really isn’t that far away.”</p> <p>Kamara will not be eligible to play for Columbus Crew until January 2015 after the club missed the deadline to register new players.</p>

We’re putting a huge effort into this.”</p> <p>While Fallon spoke on the flight deck of the 175-metre-long ship, military and civilian staff (85 of the 140-strong ship’s crew are non-military) loaded supplies, weaponry and equipment – including protective suits – on the ship ahead of her departure at high tide on Friday.</p>  <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf0dfgFzUbw"                                                                                > <iframe width="460" height="259" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gf0dfgFzUbw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Captain David Eagles, commanding officer of RFA Argus.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ship’s commanding officer Captain David Eagles, a veteran of conflicts in the Middle East and the Balkans, accepted there was an “unknown quantity” to this mission. “It is worrying to the crew and their families but I’m confident we can achieve what we’ve been tasked to do and bring all our people safely home to their families.”</p> <p>Argus has varied roles. First, she will transport personnel and hardware, including more than 50 vehicles along with tonnes of bottled water and ration packs. The voyage, which includes a stop-off in Gibraltar to pick up more gear, will take about a week.</p> <p>When in theatre, she will act as a base for three Royal Navy Merlin helicopters, which will be used in surveillance work and to move equipment and people around. Anti-submarine warfare equipment is being stripped out of the aircraft to provide more space. The ship has its own mini air traffic control centre, Flyco.</p> <p>Argus will also become a giant landing stage for powerful boats operated by 80 Royal Marines, who will provide the security for the British operation.</p>  <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLqu-NcYNaE"                                                                                > <iframe width="460" height="259" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QLqu-NcYNaE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Lieutenant Colonel Rich Cantrill on the role of the Royal Marines in Sierra Leone.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally the ship, which has the same sort of facilities available as at an NHS hospital, will provide medical cover to British personnel – military and civilian – who might suffer injury or illness while working in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>About 80 medical staff will be on board, including surgeons, consultants, radiographers, anaesthetists and nurses. Some will go on shore to help with the training; others will remain on Argus.</p> <p>What the ship will not do is treat anyone who contracts Ebola. Every time a marine or medic goes on shore, he or she will be asked to fill in a questionnaire about contacts with local people. If they have had contact, their temperature will be taken twice a day and if there are concerns that they have Ebola they will be evacuated to a British-run facility onshore.</p> <p>The idea is to keep the ship a safe, sterile environment from which the UK’s efforts can be coordinated locally.</p> <p>on Tuesday 120 members of the ship’s company gathered in the canteen to hear a 90-minute briefing on Ebola.</p> <p>Dr Ruth Howlett-Shipley, the Royal Navy’s public health consultant, told them: “We are doing everything we can to make sure that you go out safely and come back safely.” Among the questions she faced was: “If I sit next to a marine at breakfast, who shook hands with an infected person, will I contract Ebola?”</p>  <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF_gnG_d2zk"                                                                                > <iframe width="460" height="259" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zF_gnG_d2zk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Surgeon Lieutenant Dan Hawkins on his role aboard RFA Argus</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Surgeon Lieutenant Dan Hawkins, the medical officer for Argus, said: “There’s always concerns when you deploy and with the nature of where we’re going to there are added concerns and considerations but the crew are very much looking forward to going.”</p> <p>Conditions on board will vary. Some of the men in the so-called austere accommodation will sleep in 27-person dormitories; others share smaller cabins. Some will leave the vessel on missions but those who have no operational reason to head for shore will stay on board for the whole of a two- or three-month tour. They have Sky Sports and a ration of two cans of beer a day.</p> <p>It will not be a short trip – Argus has been told to prepare for six months away. Captain Eagles said the crew, medics and troops were used to working in trying conditions. “It will be quite tough but I think people will understand. I think people are going to be quite busy.”</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/un-medical-official-dies-ebola-german-hospital <p>A UN employee infected with Ebola has died in Germany, officials say.</p> <p>The 56-year-old Sudanese man had been flown from Liberia to Leipzig last Thursday, where he received treatment at a specialist unit at the St Georg clinic.</p> <p>On his arrival, doctors at the hospital described his condition as “highly critical, but stable”. On Tuesday morning the clinic confirmed in a statement that the patient had died on Monday night, “in spite of intensive medical measures and the best efforts on behalf of the medical staff”.</p> <p>The Leipzig clinic has assured the public that there is no risk of infection for people in the area. The man had arrived in Germany on a specially adapted Gulfstream jet with an isolation chamber, and had been treated on an isolation unit by staff wearing protective gear.</p> <p>According to the World Health Organisation, around 8,400 people have been infected with Ebola after the current outbreak of the disease in Africa, of whom more than 4,000 have died. The epidemic is still out of control in the west African states of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>The Sudanese man was the third Ebola victim to receive treatment in Germany. A doctor from Uganda is being treated in an isolation unit in Frankfurt, while a Senegalese man was recently released from a Hamburg clinic after five weeks of treatment.</p> <p>The German government claims to be well prepared for an outbreak of Ebola. Isolation units at hospitals in Frankfurt, Berlin, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Munich, Stuttgart and Hamburg could hold a total of 50 Ebola patients, it said. There are currently no plans to increase the number of units.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/oct/14/ebola-women-sierra-leone <p>When we consider the impact of the Ebola outbreak, our thoughts turn to the things we can quantify: the number of victims, deaths, survivors, orphans. With the death toll in west Africa <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/index.html" title="">at 4,033 and rising</a>, the world has finally comprehended the sheer scale of the crisis. The figures are frightening.</p> <p>However, here in Sierra Leone it is becoming increasingly clear that the impact extends far beyond anything that can be counted. In many respects, the collateral damage has been overlooked so far, but it can no longer be ignored in our humanitarian response.</p> <p>Each day brings stories of the hidden harm to all facets of people’s lives, including education, maternal healthcare, food security and livelihoods. From the accounts I’ve heard, one thing is evident: women are particularly vulnerable to the virus.</p> <p>Women make up <a href="http://www.aho.afro.who.int/profiles_information/index.php/Sierra_Leone:Analytical_summary_-_Gender_and_women%27s_health" title="">51% of Sierra Leone’s population</a>: they are the key to the country’s social and economic development. This is why gender activists and women’s advocacy groups in the country have <a href="http://awoko.org/2014/07/22/sierra-leone-news-marwopnet-5050-womens-forum-join-fight-against-ebola/" title="">joined forces</a> in urging leaders to address the <a href="http://www.unwomenwestandcentralafrica.com/news1/end-ebola-a-un-women-wcaro-special-newsletter-edition" title="">disproportionate effect</a> of Ebola on the female population. It is estimated that 60% of the total fatalities in west Africa <a href="www.unwomenwestandcentralafrica.com/uploads/2/0/3/3/20331433/ebola_special_edition_unwomenwcaro_sept2014.pdf" title="">have been women</a> (pdf); in Liberia, the figure is reportedly <a href="http://www.afdb.org/en/blogs/measuring-the-pulse-of-economic-transformation-in-west-africa/post/ebola-the-need-for-a-gendered-approach-13472/" title="">as high as 75%</a>.</p> <p>In Sierra Leone’s patriarchal society, women are the primary care-givers at home and in the community. Custom dictates that they tend to sick family members, nurse children and work as traditional healers and healthcare assistants. It is sisters, daughters, aunts, mothers and grandmothers who have selflessly cared for relatives infected with Ebola; unwittingly, they have put themselves at great risk.</p> <p>When their relatives die, it is women who perform the funeral rituals, which involve touching the highly infectious corpse. In Guinea, burial practices are linked to 60% of Ebola cases. The figure is thought to be similar in Sierra Leone. I have heard alarming reports of angry groups hijacking Ebola burial teams and forcibly removing the bodies of their loved ones, in order to give them a “fitting” sendoff.</p> <p>Widespread confusion and misunderstanding about the causes and consequences of Ebola has perpetuated the spread of the virus. That’s why it has been so critical for Christian Aid partners to train hundreds of community health volunteers to raise awareness of the disease.</p> <p>Women have also been threatened by the near collapse of the fragile health infrastructure: medical facilities are overwhelmed and under-resourced, many private hospitals are closed and public hospitals are no longer dealing with non-Ebola cases. Consequently, there is little in the way of healthcare provision for more common conditions such as malaria or typhoid.</p> <p>Sierra Leone has one of the world’s highest maternal mortality rates: <a href="http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/sierraleone_statistics.html" title="">890 of every 100,000 women die from pregnancy-related causes</a>. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2960074-4/fulltext" title="">national free healthcare initiative</a> (for pregnant women, lactating mothers and children under five), we had made some strides in getting pregnant women to move away from using traditional birth attendants.</p> <p>Sadly, there is now a huge decrease in the numbers of women going to clinics for antenatal care and deliveries. Statistics are hard to come by, due to limitations on movement, but there is a real risk that women who are too afraid to seek medical care are instead dying at home from complications in childbirth. Meanwhile, access to family planning services is limited. This means that the meagre gains are being further eroded.</p> <p>Education – so critical to help young women develop – is also under threat. Schools are closed indefinitely. This is no small matter in a country where 60% of people are illiterate. In households where children have been orphaned, it is likely that girls will have to drop out of school to assume the role of the care-giver.</p> <p>Women dominate Sierra Leone’s informal sector, which has been hard hit. The women who rely on market trade, micro-credit schemes and agricultural work are experiencing a severe loss of income. Food and cash-crop production has been interrupted: food prices are rocketing and food security is now a serious concern. At Christian Aid, we are particularly concerned about the welfare of people in quarantine, who have very little means of accessing food.</p> <p>Those losing out, but for once in a welcome way, include Sierra Leone’s Sowei women. These traditional leaders carry out initiation ceremonies on young girls as part of their entry into the Bondo secret societies. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a key part of the initiation into these all-female societies: some studies suggest over 90% of girls in Sierra Leone are subject to FGM.</p> <p>The initiation ceremony normally takes place during the long school holiday between June and August. However, the national Sowei Council has suspended all Bondo society initiations during the Ebola outbreak. As a Sierra Leonean woman who has long spoken out against FGM, this outcome is one silver lining to a very dark cloud.</p> <p><em>• Jeanne Kamara is Christian Aid’s country manager for Sierra Leone, and is based in Freetown</em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/13/hospitals-warned-prepare-ebola-second-diagnosis <p>Federal health officials are imploring hospitals to “think Ebola” as officials in Texas scramble to identify all staff involved in the care of America’s patient zero in the wake of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/us-ebola-diagnosis-cdc-chief-deeply-concerning">diagnosis of a female nurse</a> who is the first person to contract the disease in the US. </p> <p>“We have to rethink the way we address Ebola infection and control because even a single infection is unacceptable,” Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said at a press conference on Monday. </p> <p>On Sunday, four days after Thomas Eric Duncan died in an isolation unit at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/us-ebola-diagnosis-cdc-chief-deeply-concerning">the CDC confirmed a nurse had contracted Ebola</a>, in the first case of transmission of the virus in the US and the second outside Africa. The nurse is in stable condition, according to Frieden. <br /></p> <p>Frieden said hospitals need to be prepared to diagnose a patient for the disease, which has killed more than 4,000 across west Africa since the current outbreak began. He said this begins with asking the person if they have travelled to Africa’s three most affected countries – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – in the past 21 days. </p> <p>“If this one individual was infected and we don’t know how, within the isolation unit, then it is possible that other individuals could have been infected as well,” Frieden said. “So we consider them to potentially be at risk.”</p> <p>President Obama was briefed on Monday by members of his public health and national security team on the response to the apparent breach of infection control protocol in Dallas. </p> <p>Texas health commissioner Dr David Lakey said all levels of government are working together to identify and interview the healthcare workers involved in Duncan’s treatment, as well as anyone the nurse may have made contact with once she began showing symptoms. </p> <p>Only one person has been identified thus far as having direct contact with the woman; that person is being monitored, as is the nurse’s dog. Lakey said the woman’s apartment is in the process of being cleaned and decontaminated on Monday.<br /></p> <p>The nurse was not among the 48 people who came into contact with Duncan outside the hospital who are currently under observation by officials in Texas. Frieden said officials will continue to monitor those people, 10 of whom are considered “high risk”, for symptoms during the remainder of the virus’s 21-day incubation period. So far, all are asymptomatic. </p> <p>On Sunday, Frieden expressed his deep concern over a “breach in protocol” that he said led to the nurse being infected, but on Monday clarified this remark, saying it was wrongly interpreted as casting blame on the hospital or healthcare worker. He praised the hospital’s staff for their diligent care of Duncan, who died on Wednesday. <br /></p> <p>“The enemy here is a virus: Ebola. It’s not a person, it’s not a country, it’s not a place, it’s not a hospital. It’s a virus. It’s a virus that’s tough to fight,” Frieden said. “ But together, I’m confident that we will stop it. What we need to do is all take responsibility for improving the safety of those on the front lines.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/13/ebola-crisis-uk-fever-tests-heathrow-airport <p>Passengers will have their temperatures tested for suspected Ebola at Heathrow terminal one from Tuesday but it will be impossible to check all the 1,000 people a month arriving from the worst affected countries, the UK health secretary Jeremy Hunt has admitted.</p> <p>Hunt said it was likely that Ebola would be diagnosed in the UK by the end of the year but the best estimates suggested there would probably be less than 10 cases over the next three months.</p> <p>He estimated 89% of passengers to the UK from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea would be identified by screening at the border but the authorities are relying to some extent on travellers “self-presenting”.</p> <p>As Hunt outlined measures to stop the virus coming to the UK, he faced questions from MPs about why there would be no screening of passengers who arrive through regional airports and why checks at Gatwick, Eurostar and other Heathrow terminals could not be brought in sooner.</p> <p>The Immigration Services Union (ISU), representing some 5,000 UK border staff, also described the plans as a “missed opportunity”, saying all passengers should be screened for higher temperature as they departed the actual aircraft rather than at border control.</p> <p>Lucy Moreton, ISU general secretary, said: “They are asking passengers who believe that they may have been in contact with an infected persons to self-refer. They have to present themselves to the Public Health England individual who is located behind the arrivals control, some 300 or 400 hundred metres behind and around a corner, not even immediately in line of sight. You have to actually go and seek them out.”</p> <p>Ministers have so far spent £125m on emergency preparations and tackling the virus at its source in west Africa, where it has caused 4,033 deaths and more than 8,000 suspected cases. The UK government has sent 750 troops to Africa to help deal with containment, while more than 650 NHS staff and 130 Public Health England staff have volunteered to go out to Sierra Leone, where the British are taking a leading role in international aid efforts. So far, a Spanish nurse and Texas health care worker have contracted the disease outside Africa while caring for infected patients.</p> <p>There are no direct flights to the UK from affected west African countries but there are indirect routes via mainland Europe. Last week, the government initially said there was no need for screening and then resisted the idea of temperature screening like that introduced in the US. However, Hunt told the House of Commons on Monday that a fever test would now be included, on top of a medical risk questionnaire.</p> <p>“Passengers will have their temperature taken and complete a questionnaire asking about their current health, recent travel history and whether they might be at potential risk through contact with Ebola patients,” Hunt told MPs.</p> <p>“They will also be required to provide contact details. If neither the questionnaire nor the temperature reading raises any concerns, passengers will be told how to make contact with the NHS should they develop Ebola symptoms within the 21-day incubation period, and allowed to continue on their journey. It is important to stress that a person with Ebola is only infectious if they are displaying symptoms.</p> <p>“Any passenger who reports recent exposure to people who may have Ebola, or symptoms, or who has a raised temperature will undergo a clinical assessment and, if necessary, will be transferred to hospital.</p> <p>“Passengers identified as having any level of increased risk of Ebola, but without any symptoms, will be given a Public Health England contact number to call should they develop any symptoms consistent with Ebola within the 21-day incubation period.”</p> <p>Labour MP John McDonnell, whose Hayes and Harlington seat includes Heathrow, questioned who would carry out the screening following the government’s decision to close the Heathrow’s health control unit earlier this year. Hunt insisted 200 staff would be ready to start conducting checks.</p> <p>The health secretary said operators of the 111 medical helpline, GPs, nurses and NHS receptionists had all received information on how to identify the symptoms of Ebola, which include respiratory problems, high temperatures, diarrhoea and vomiting. In the UK, 26 beds have been made available at hospitals to deal with potential cases, including a specialist centre at the Royal Free in north London, and further capacity at Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield.</p> <p>Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, welcomed the preparations but criticised the government for its “confusion” last week over whether there would be screening at UK borders.</p> <p>Hunt said the government modified its position after the advice from Dame Sally Davies, the UK chief medical officer, changed last week.</p> <p>Over the weekend, Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, warned there is little doubt a case of Ebola would come to the UK and would most probably be in London.</p> <p>The London mayor also admitted that health checks at UK airports were a “far from perfect solution” and cautioned the government against seeming to “promise stuff that doesn’t really make any sense”.</p> <p>Politicians across the world began to act after UN has raised the alarm that Ebola is spreading “exponentially” in west Africa and set a three-month deadline to get the deadly virus under control.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has also warned the epidemic is the “most severe acute health emergency in modern times”. The WHO director-general, Margaret Chan, said the outbreak had shown “the world is ill-prepared to respond to any severe, sustained, and threatening public health emergency”.</p> <p>In a statement to a conference in the Philippine capital, Manila, she said: “I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries. I have never seen an infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/13/ebola-nurses-describe-life-death-on-frontline-liberia-sierra-leone <h2>Bridget Mulrooney, 36<br />American nurse working for the International Medical Corps in Bong County, Liberia<br /></h2> <p>I was working as a travel nurse at a children’s hospital in California when I got an email from <a href="http://www.internationalmedicalcorps.org.uk/">International Medical Corps</a> asking if I was interested in deploying to Liberia to help fight Ebola. I wanted to go immediately but I was locked into a contract at the time. The more I heard, the more excited I got. Within three days of finishing my contract, I was in Alabama being trained in how to treat Ebola patients safely and within a week I was in Liberia.</p> <p>I have now been at the Ebola treatment unit (ETU) for two weeks and what an incredible experience it has been. This week, I am on the night shift so my working day starts at 7pm. Tonight, we have 12 patients in the unit who are confirmed as having the Ebola virus. One of the patients is a nine-year-old girl who came with her mother when they were both sick. Her mum tested negative for Ebola but unfortunately the girl tested positive. Her mother opted to go home, leaving her daughter behind. She is very weak and really scared now that she is here all alone, so I am going to spend some extra time with her tonight, feeding her to try to get her strength back up.</p> <p>Our personal protective equipment (PPE) suits get really hot. We spend up to two hours at a time in the ETU with the patients, which is about the longest you can comfortably remain inside the suits without a break.</p> <p>Everyone I know is very supportive of me being here. I have been doing this type of volunteering for organisations such as IMC for a while. My family are used to me announcing that I’m off to some place where there is a disease outbreak or some other risk to my safety. I guess they were more worried than usual about the risks associated with Ebola, but they are still totally supportive.</p> <p>I am worried about the backlash against healthcare workers who are responding to the crisis in West Africa. I have heard media reports calling for people such as me who have been treating Ebola patients to be quarantined for 21 or even 42 days. These ideas are not based on the medical facts. People only need to be quarantined if they are showing symptoms and if you do not have a fever, there is no risk of you transmitting Ebola to someone. We work really hard here, the hours are long and the work is physically and emotionally tiring. When we get time off every six weeks, I would like to think I can travel anywhere I want to but I suspect we are reaching a situation where I am not going to be welcome in many places.</p> <p>Four new patients arrived at around midnight in ambulances. Tonight we saw a father and two sons: the dad is really very sick, throwing up every few minutes. We gave him and the other patients plenty of fluids and medicine to help with the vomiting and then we took the blood test that would confirm whether or not they had the Ebola virus. After triaging the patients, we made our way to the confirmed ward to carry the body of a patient who had died earlier in the night to the morgue.</p> <p>The sun comes up around 6am, and the team on the nightshift often get together to watch it. Our Liberian colleagues will start singing and we will have a dance around for a few minutes. It’s a small thing but after a long night, when you have had patients die, it is a very emotional time.</p> <p>My shift finishes at 7am after I have handed over to the daytime crew. We will be back doing exactly the same again tomorrow night. That is a fairly typical night in the ETU: not too scary, at times even fun, and hopefully we are doing great things.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-b92b20a0-b41c-4635-919b-c7da7b3ace47"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/13/1413221060500/43683822-a1f4-4966-9234-ce44e83b2590-460x276.jpeg" alt="A burial team" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">A burial team unloads an Ebola victim, who died while in transit in an ambulance in Monrovia, Liberia.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Watching a life drain away</strong></p> <p>Ebola is mean. It’s harsh and it can tear families apart one by one, or take them all out together. We recently had a teenage girl bleed to death over two days of IV-site oozing. Sounds easy to fix, right? Pressure dressing, elevation, blah blah. Sorry, that’s not how things work in an Ebola unit. You do all the normal interventions but a 20-gauge needle hole in a hand can slowly and fully drain the life source out of someone. Walking into a room that is covered in blood, finding a semi-conscious girl face down on a bed pooling with barely congealed blood is hard. It’s harder the second day when you know all your efforts couldn’t slow that life destruction. I cleaned her up, and put her in a pair of still-tagged jeans. She half smiled and took some medicines. I won’t forget her smile. Nor her soft moans as her body was fading away.</p> <p>This morning, I carried a baby to the tent morgue. The baby’s father had died days earlier in the ambulance ride to our ETU. The baby tested positive for malaria. We are still waiting for Ebola tests to come back on the mother and baby. The floppy, listless baby seemed to be turning a corner last night at 10. He smiled and took medicine willingly. His mother, lying near him, was vomiting and too weak to care for him any more. We went back inside a second time at 4am and stayed a while. Baby drank and we tried to get him to learn how to drink from a bottle so he could fend for himself. I came out joyed at baby’s bounceback! At around 5.30am, the mother came out crying. Baby had died. It was a shock and a testament to how rapidly situations can change. On the trip in to get the baby, two more patients had expired.</p> <p>The high elation for our recovered patients is what it is because of the contrast of the deep sorrows of the many lows.</p> <p>Ebola is not slowing down yet. I am trying my hardest to encourage everyone to drink through the nausea and vomiting, to eat, and to try to have hope of recovery. Nursing wise, we are doing high-level care. But the focus is getting OK care to more people than good care to just a few.</p> <p>I have obviously had a hard few days and I am sorry for being graphic. But this is what it really is like being in Liberia during Ebola.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-0bf98d2f-4b23-4fe1-a8c5-4ab500f4a64a"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/13/1413220906986/94e5dcdc-67f5-48b1-b1b5-c5ae80d58273-460x276.jpeg" alt="Health workers disinfect a home" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Members of District 13 ambulance service are watched by neighbours as they disinfect a room in a Liberian town where they had picked up six suspected Ebola sufferers.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Jerome Delay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sue Ellen Kovack, 56<br />Australian Red Cross nurse, Kenema, Sierra Leone<br /></h2> <p>At the start of the day, I check my hands for any cuts or scrapes that will bar me from donning PPE. Entering the centre, I must wash my hands in a 0.05% chlorine solution. I balance on one foot as someone sprays the bottoms of my shoes with 0.5% chlorine before being allowed entry to the low-risk area.</p> <p>I search for a pair of cold wet boots in my size, which have been soaking in chlorine for the night, and I change into my scrubs. I go straight to the whiteboard to see who has passed away during the night; today, it’s one of three nurses who became infected at work. One is on his way to good health, the other is still hanging on.</p> <p>We need to synchronise putting the PPE on with other team members, because if one is slower than the rest we end up waiting and baking in the sun. We have a dresser to make sure we are completely covered, or we work in pairs and check each other. First on are gloves and a jumpsuit. Then a second pair of gloves, a thick duckbill mask, a hood, and an apron that is tied by the dresser so we can untie it with one pull. Then on go the goggles with a generous drizzle of antifogging spray, a final check in the mirror and a final check with each other. The checking does not stop there, as we must ensure during our time in the high-risk area that we are still covered, that a mask has not slipped, or that a piece of skin has not been exposed. If that happens, we leave the area immediately. We check the time – 45 minutes to one hour is the maximum allowed in the PPE.</p> <p>We have the luxury of four nurses today. Patients who are feeling well enough are sitting on plastic chairs waiting for a meal. We might offer some pain relief, or a smile from beneath our PPE (yes, you can smile with your eyes).</p> <p>Hannah (not her real name) is sitting outside, greeting us with a big smile. She has lost all her children to Ebola as well as her husband. And here she is asking me how my evening was. The staff tell me she has had some bad moments, but all they can do is reassure her that she is young and can bear more children.</p> <p>Others have not fared so well – too weak to sit up, or get to the toilet or the shower block. We do our best to offer fluids, a wash and some paracetamol. The local nursing staff have amazing courage to work in our centre. Their families ostracise them, but they still come, to try to bring an end to this brutal, invisible “war”. In Africa, it is usually the family that feeds, washes and comforts the patients. But no family members are allowed inside our treatment centre.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-957ad651-247f-4ef1-942f-3acc1fe63e19"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/13/1413220954907/fda2d2a5-1597-42ad-be8f-3fff56524803-460x276.jpeg" alt="Sue Ellen Kovack" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Sue Ellen Kovack at work at an Ebola clinic in Sierra Leone.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My three key words are warm, dry and comfortable. Patients who are too weak to move away from their own vomit, faeces and urine need the most help. We clean and care for as many as we can, but if we need to leave the area because of heat exhaustion or feeling unwell, the priority is to get out. You are a danger to your colleagues if you go down in your PPE.</p> <p>After our nursing team goes in, the hygiene team suits up for their rounds. They clean up the vomit, diarrhoea and urine spills, the garbage and the nappies. Their task is monumental and they can be at most risk.</p> <p>A minimum of five minutes is needed to undress. We have two tents, where the undressers and sprayers need to be on the ball. The urge to just pull the suit off is strong, but we wait. First, the chlorine spray to the hands. Then, feet apart, arms in the air, we are sprayed from head to toe, first the front, then the back. We wash our hands in 0.5% chlorine. Off come the first set of gloves.</p> <p>We wash our hands again. Off comes the apron and hopefully it was tied perfectly, as we have to blindly reach around to release the knot; we pull it over our heads. Into the chlorine soak it goes. We wash our hands.</p> <p>Next go the goggles. We bend over, close our eyes and gently remove them, dunk them three times in the strong chlorine-filled bucket, and then place them in water. We wash our hands.</p> <p>The hood comes off next. Once again, we bend over, closing our eyes to avoid contamination and dispose of the hood in the garbage. We wash our hands.</p> <p>Next, the removal of our heavy PPE. Moving slowly – we do everything slowly here – we carefully expose the zipper, hidden under a taped-down flap. We wash our hands. Blindly, we have to find the zipper, as our undressers and sprayers guide us. We wash our hands.</p> <p>As we shimmy out of our PPE, we are soaked to the bone in sweat, but it feels great. This is the hardest part: to ease off the jumpsuit while kicking your legs back, at the same time standing on it so it doesn’t fly away from you. It’s a balancing act. The sprayer sprays the entire jumpsuit with a stronger chlorine solution and we put it in the garbage. We wash our hands.</p> <p>Our heavy-duty filtration mask is next. I close my eyes and hope it doesn’t catch in my ponytail. We wash our hands.</p> <p>The last pair of gloves comes off. Our boots are sprayed from all angles and we have to balance on one foot to cross the line from high risk to low risk. We wash our hands and we are done, stripped down to our scrubs, soaked with sweat.</p> <p>I need a rehydration solution or water. No food is allowed in the low-risk area. It is too risky to put anything near your mouth from your hands. But I still see people biting their nails, touching their face, rubbing their eyes – risky but automatic responses. Your hands have been washed a trillion times in chlorine, but still, you don’t know how safe your other colleagues have been. You are literally entrusting your life to your work mates. Before I left Australia, I took to wearing a rubber band and each time I caught myself touching my face, I snapped it painfully so I would remember not to do it.</p> <p>I hear an ambulance and the siren is going fast – it may pass us and head to the next treatment centre, hours away. But it abruptly turns into our driveway and we run out to greet it. I suit up and prepare for the admissions with a package consisting of a blanket, soap, towel, cup, toothbrush and toothpaste, all in a covered bucket that will be used for vomit/faeces or urine if the person is unable to get to the latrines.</p> <p>The ambulance door is opened and I can see a man on the stretcher, two legs in the air, stiff as a board. They slowly drop and I realise this patient is dying. But he walked into the ambulance in Freetown. It is a five-hour drive through a dozen checkpoints and deterioration comes rapidly. I pronounce him dead, and move on to the other patient.</p> <p>The female patient is lying on the floor between the seat and the stretcher, strapped in by seatbelts. She is trapped, a terrorised look in her eyes. She is flailing wildly, a dangerous situation in itself. I try to calm her while maintaining my distance. We move her as best we can, but then I realise that she is just trying to cover her exposed area below her waist. In her last moments, this is her concern. We manage to get her into a tent. We ask her name, if she is married. She responds, “I am married”, looks away and dies. All that struggle and desperation in the ambulance and she only wanted to preserve her dignity. That was a tough moment.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-6ef84808-f054-4feb-83b0-058e6860ebdc"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/13/1413220991778/b7958c1b-5ca1-4296-be1f-499f9e1888be-460x276.jpeg" alt="Health worker with child" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">A health worker in Liberia carries a four-year-old child who is suspected on having Ebola.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Anine Kongelf, 27<br />Norwegian Red Cross nurse, Kenema, Sierra Leone<br /></h2> <p>Finally, a happy day: 11-year-old Kadiatu and 35-year-old Osman are being discharged as our first two Ebola survivors. Their blood tests have come back negative – they are no longer infectious and can safely return to their families and communities. For the whole week we have been separated by 1.5 metre-high orange fencing. I have been throwing “plumpinut” [a nutritious peanut paste] and biscuits across the fence to Kadiatu, and we have been talking, singing and even dancing for the past two days – from our separate sides. Today, there is no more fence between us.</p> <p>My first week as a community health delegate at the centre, run by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, has been a surreal rollercoaster between life and death, hope, grief, pain and joy. My first task was to oversee four burials. As a team in full PPE carried the corpses in double body bags out of the morgue, we were there to pay our last respects and to make sure the burial site was mapped and the graves marked. The sad fact is that there will be many more graves as the centre will admit more patients, and some of them will lose the battle against the virus. One of the bodies that day was an eight-year-old boy.</p> <p>When we returned from the burial site, the boy’s family had arrived to ask for news about him. His father had already died from Ebola, but his uncle and brother came all the way from Freetown, a five-hour drive away. The two men had been in contact with people with Ebola and therefore might be infected and carriers of the virus, so we could not bring them into the low-risk area. Nor could they see their nephew and brother. We brought them instead to the unused triage area, where we could speak in private, with the safe orange fencing between us. They don’t say much at the news of the boy’s death. There is a nod of understanding, but their faces express shock and disbelief. At the end of the day, I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to do this for a whole month.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-73bef84c-9a44-4ab9-bc45-d9d01173ef8e"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/13/1413221012468/07c62f3f-600d-41db-8309-55bbb07839c8-460x276.jpeg" alt="Anine Kongelf " width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Anine Kongelf at Kenema treatment centre in Sierra Leone.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Red Cross</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kadiatu was one of the first patients at the treatment centre, and because she had been inside the high-risk area she had to go through the “happy shower” before she could be discharged: a chlorine bath followed by a normal soapy shower to remove all potential remains of the virus. Her contaminated clothes were destroyed and she was given a new dress and sandals. When she came out she was clean, uncontaminated and safe. She turned around to wave to Haja – another Ebola patient who has been taking care of Kadiatu inside – and walked out past the double orange fencing.</p> <p>As we wait for her transport home to Freetown, we can finally sit together. Kadiatu is brought breakfast and vitamins, but the nurses no longer need to wear the personal protective equipment, and the psychosocial counsellor can talk to her in private and uninterrupted. Kadiatu makes us dance for her as she sings, and we can take photos together without being worried about coming too close. Magically, our first survivor is this beautiful, strong 11-year-old with the widest, whitest smile I have ever seen, and as the car drives off I know she will be fine. Her mother and siblings are waiting for her at home, and for us, the staff at the treatment centre, we know that people can survive Ebola and that there will be many more happy days like this one in the midst of all the fear and despair.</p>

Whilst there are no direct flights from the affected region, there are indirect routes into the UK. </p> <p>So in the next week, Public Health England will start screening and monitoring UK-bound air passengers, identified by the Border Force, coming on to the main routes from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. This will allow potential cases arriving in the UK to be identified, tracked and given rapid access to expert health advice if they need it. </p> <p>These measures will start tomorrow at Heathrow, which receives around 85% of all such arrivals across the airport, beginning with Terminal 1. They will be expanded by the end of next week to arrivals into Gatwick and on the Eurostar which connects to Paris and Brussels-bound arrivals.</p> <p>Passengers will have their temperature taken and complete a questionnaire asking about their current health, recent travel history and whether they might be at potential risk through contact with Ebola patients. They will also be required to provide contact details.</p> <p>If neither the questionnaire nor the temperature reading raises any concerns, passengers will be told how to make contact with the NHS should they develop Ebola symptoms within the 21 day incubation period, and allowed to continue on their journey. It is important to stress that a person with Ebola is only infectious if they are displaying symptoms. </p> <p>Any passenger who reports recent exposure to people who may have Ebola, or symptoms, or who has a raised temperature will undergo a clinical assessment and, if necessary, will be transferred to hospital. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said these screening measures would not reach 100% of people coming to the UK from the affected areas. </strong>To reach these people, posters will be on display at ports and airports advising people to get themselves checked.<br /></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We expect these measures to reach 89% of travellers we know have come to the UK from the affected region on tickets directly booked for the UK.</p> <p>But it is important to note that no screening or monitoring procedure will be able to identify 100% of the people arriving from Ebola-affected countries, not least because not all passengers leaving the countries will immediately take connecting routes to the UK.</p> <p>So today I can announce that the government will ensure, working with the devolved administrations, that there is highly visible information displayed at all entry points to the UK asking passengers to identify themselves in their own best interests if they have travelled to the affection regions in the last 21 days. This information for travellers will be available by the end of this week.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said NHS 111 call handlers were being asked to ask callers with respiratory symptoms about their travel history, and that alerts were going out to doctors. </strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said there 26 Ebola beds available in the UK.</strong><br /></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>If [people] test positive for Ebola they will then be transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in North London, which is the UK specialist centre for treating the most dangerous infectious diseases. We also have plans in place to surge Ebola bed capacity in Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield, making a total of 26 beds available in the UK. </p> <p>We will always follow medical advice as to whether any measures we adopt are likely to be effective and are a proportionate response to risk. However, I do believe that we are amongst the best and most-prepared countries in the world. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government had co-funded trials of a possible Ebola vaccine. </strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said there have been been “4,033 confirmed deaths and 8399 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola recorded in seven countries, although widespread transmission is confined to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.”</strong> Cases are doubling every three to four weeks, he said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said the UK was the second biggest donor to the international effort to tackle the Ebola crisis in west Africa.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>With the World Health Organisation, we are training more than 120 health workers a week, and piloting a new community approach to Ebola care to reduce, and hopefully stop, the transmission rate. We are also building and providing laboratory services, and supporting an information campaign in-country.</p> <p>We are now deploying the Royal Navy’s RFA Argus and its Merlin helicopters along with highly-skilled military personnel bringing our military deployment to 750. They will support the construction of the Kerrytown Ebola treatment centre and other facilities, provide logistics and planning support, and help establish and staff a World Health Organisation-led Ebola training facility to increase training to health workers.</p> <p>Taken together, the UK contribution stands at £125 million plus invaluable human expertise and is the second highest bilateral contribution after the US. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2014-10-13T16:39:38.067+01:00">at 4.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-543beb43e4b0cd82a095f4f7" class="block"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-13T16:17:09.436+01:00">4.17pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> is responding to Andy Burnham.</p> <p>He says the three countries worst affected each have a partner country helping them.

Passengers will also be given advice on what to do should they develop symptoms later.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>As the Chief Medical Officer’s advice makes clear, these measures will help to improve our ability to detect and isolate Ebola cases. However, it is important to stress that given the nature of this disease, no system could offer 100% protection from non-symptomatic cases.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>And here is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/national-ebola-exercise-concludes">a news release about the eight-hour exercise that took place on Saturday to test the measures in place to ensure that the UK could cope with an Ebola outbreak.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-543bdb7de4b05b59a7d0282e" class="block"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-13T15:07:04.096+01:00">3.07pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>David Cameron posed with some blacked-up Morris dancers at the weekend, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11158847/David-Cameron-poses-with-blacked-up-Morris-dancers-at-Banbury-Folk-Festival.html">according to the Telegraph.</a></p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/TelegraphNews/statuses/521659657157607425">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>David Cameron pictured posing with blacked-up Morris dancers at Banbury Folk Festival <a href="http://t.co/q20Lfxcqm2">http://t.co/q20Lfxcqm2</a> <a href="http://t.co/bljGPRhU4n">pic.twitter.com/bljGPRhU4n</a></p>&mdash; Telegraph News (@TelegraphNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/TelegraphNews/status/521659657157607425">October 13, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11158847/David-Cameron-poses-with-blacked-up-Morris-dancers-at-Banbury-Folk-Festival.html">The Telegraph says there is an innocent explanation.</a><br /></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In April Jack Straw’s son Will, who is standing as a parliamentary candidate in next year’s general election, caused a stir when he posed with a similar group, with some people branding him “racist” on Twitter.</p> <p>According to the founder of the Foxs Morris dancers, the tradition of blacking up in Border Morris dancing dates back to the 16th century, when out of work farm labourers would beg for money, covering their faces in soot to avoid being recognised because begging was illegal at the time.</p> <p>Martin de Vine, founder and Squire of the Foxs Morris dancers, said: “David Cameron was having a coffee and we saw him and just asked if he would have a picture taken.</p> <p>“We dance in the style of Border Morris, and we black our faces because farm labourers who were out of work in the winter months would go around begging, performing a dance in return for money.</p> <p>“They blacked their faces with soot because it was illegal to beg and they didn’t want to be recognised.

I’ll post a summary shortly.</p> <p>In the meantime, here’s a bit more on the televised leaders’ debate proposal. </p> <p><strong>Natalie Bennett</strong>, the Green party leader, said the proposal from the broadcasters to exclude her party showed how out of touch they were. In a statement she said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>With these statements the broadcasters are demonstrating just how out of touch they are with the public mood, and how ridiculously they cling to the idea that the future of politics looks like the past. </p> <p>It is clear from votes and polls that the public are fed up with the three business-as-usual parties and are looking around for alternatives. That is also demonstrated by the soaring membership of the Green parties of England and Wales and Scotland, now exceeding 27,000. Those members, the fast-growing numbers of likely Green voters (matching Lib Dems numbers), and the majority who back Green policies like bringing the railways back into public hands and the living wage for all workers would be seriously shortchanged by debates from which we were excluded.</p> </blockquote> <p>And it is worth recalling that this is not the only televised leaders’s debate proposal on the table. As we announced earlier this year, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/15/guardian-telegraph-youtube-launch-bid-2015-election-leaders-debate">there is also a Guardian/Telegraph/YouTube plan to hold a debate. </a>Here’s an extract from the story written at the time. </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>A proposal for a party leaders’ 2015 election debate to be staged on the internet is being launched by a unique alliance of YouTube, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian">the Guardian</a>, and the Telegraph.</p> <p>The initiative for a debate broadcast through YouTube would break the monopoly of existing broadcasters and allow innovative forms of audience participation for the political parties. The proposal, using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23onlinedebate&amp;src=typd">#onlinedebate</a>, has been in preparation for months and was sent to the main party leaders on Thursday following informal talks with politicians.</p> <p>The cross-platform collaboration would put an online debate before the vast majority of the UK’s 55 million internet users, and would be aimed at engaging a younger and more interactive audience.</p> <p>A live feed could be embedded on any media site and be carried by any broadcasters on traditional TV and radio.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-543b9ed1e4b0fd64f752f937" class="block is-key-event"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-13T10:57:29.890+01:00">10.57am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Leaders' debate proposal - snap analysis</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Leaders’ debate proposal - snap analysis: </strong>As Peter Kellner argues (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2014/oct/13/jeremy-hunts-commons-statement-on-ebola-politics-live-blog#block-543b99e1e4b0fd64f752f932">see 10.37am</a>), the broadcasters’ proposal for televised leaders’ debates quite cleverly accommodates the need to include Ukip, without giving them equal billing to Labour and the Conservatives. But will it ever happen? Or has the Lib Dem statement just killed it off?</p> <p>First, these debates are not inevitable. Although you hear people say that they have become an established part of the election landscape, and that it would be democratically unthinkable not to have them, that is not the case. In the US, the first presidential debate was held in 1960, but the next one did not happen until 1976. It is relatively easy for a party, while pretending to be in favour of a debate in principle, to refuse to sign up to the details. Labour did this in 1997.</p> <p>Second, David Cameron may say he favours a debate, but it is hard to see how it would be in his interests. The main beneficiary from these proposed debates would probably be Nigel Farage. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/17/lynton-crosby-veto-leaders-debates-cameron">That is why Lynton Crosby is opposed</a>. (And one thing we’ve learned from the party conference season is that, what Crosby wants in Tory politics, he normally gets.)</p> <p>Third, the proposal does not accommodate Cameron’s main objection to debates. He has said he is in favour, but that he does not like they way they dominate the campaign. He has suggested debates should take place before the short campaign starts. But these three debates would all take place in April, the month before polling day.</p> <p>Fourth, Nick Clegg’s decision to reject the proposed format may give Cameron some cover. If one leader alone were to reject the proposed format, conceivably they could be “empty chaired” by the broadcasters (although I have not had time to check whether broadcasting law would allow this).

Stringer was at it again on the Today programme this morning. Here are the key points he made.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Stringer said Miliband’s team was “hopeless”.</strong><br /></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There is a problem that applies to Ed and the people round him that the Labour Party have recruited and appointed too many people who have very little experience of the world. They have been assistants to MPs, bag carriers for ministers, they’ve come through the system, they’ve been parachuted into seats where they’ve got no roots. It’s meant there’s been a disconnect with parts of the party - particularly the leadership - and what’s really happening in many of the communities we hope to represent ...</p> <p>We have to improve the people around Ed. I would sack quite a lot of the people. I think the team is hopeless around him. They’re giving him very bad advice. The shadow cabinet are individually all decent, hard-working people; collectively, they don’t have the breadth of experience that Ed needs for advice.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the party was out of touch with voters’ concerns in Heywood and Middleton.</strong><br /></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In the Heywood and Middleton by-election it was the line coming from the leadership that this was about the health service. You only had to knock on three or four doors in Middleton or Heywood to find that what people were talking about was immigration. You can’t hope to win elections if you don’t talk about what the people are talking about. We have a problem on both communications and credibility. People have to believe what we say and at the moment they simply don’t do that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Miliband was unpopular with voters.</strong><br /></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>If you go on the doorstep, Ed isn’t an asset to us. I don’t think that’s even a controversial thing to say, rather sadly. They think he doesn’t understand the problems they are suffering. </p> </blockquote> <p>Stringer was on the Today programme with another Labour MP, <strong>Yasmin Qureshi</strong>, who said she disagreed with his analysis.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think that to suggest that Ed’s team is responsible for the difficulties in Heywood and Middleton, I think you’re wrong. I think what we have to remember [is] that in Heywood and Middleton the Labour vote actually went up and I think that’s really important. The Labour vote did not collapse and therefore to say that the Labour party is completely disconnected to voters and don’t understand their concerns, it is wrong.</p> </blockquote> <p>I’ve taken some of the quotes from<a href="http://www.politicshome.com"> PoliticsHome.</a></p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="6325b63d21e23fd2a697b4a15248c05f3d8a74d4"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/13/1413190848742/61d9cdac-4fc8-4729-b7c5-06f09be48f8c-460x276.jpeg" alt="Graham Stringer" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Graham Stringer</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: CHRISTOPHER THOMOND/Christopher Thomond</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id="block-543b8c91e4b042a2462082fe" class="block is-key-event"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-13T09:46:47.727+01:00">9.46am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Jeremy Hunt's morning interviews - Summary</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>As I mentioned earlier, Jeremy Hunt has been giving a round of interviews this morning. They were largely about today’s strike by NHS hospital staff and midwives. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/live/2014/oct/13/nhs-hospital-staff-midwives-strike-over-pay-live-updates">My colleague Peter Walker is writing a separate live blog about that strike, </a>and he has covered what Hunt has said about pay.</p> <p>But here are the other key points that emerged from the interviews.</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/13/uk-must-ready-ebola-outbreak-worsen-jeremy-hunt"><strong>Hunt said the global Ebola outbreak would get “a lot worse” and that Britain had to be prepared for this.</strong></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected suggestions that screening for Ebola at airports was ineffective.</strong><br /></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think there are a lot of misunderstandings and that’s why it’s very important that we get the right training in place, put in place the right procedures. The main purpose of the airport screening that we are introducing is not actually to identify people who have Ebola, have the symptoms right now because most of them would have been prevented form flying by the checks that you have already in the airports at those countries. </p> <p>The main purpose is to identify higher risk people because the virus incubates for 21 days and we need to make sure that anyone that is higher risk – we know their contact details, we are able to stay in touch with them, monitor their temperature on a daily basis so that if they do develop the symptoms we can get to them quickly. And that is better for them, that massively increases their chance of survival, but is also much safer for the public. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He defended the government’s controversial Health Act which reorganised the NHS.</strong> This came when he was asked about <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4234883.ece">a story in today’s Times (paywall) saying senior Tories now think the Act was their biggest mistake. </a>Here’s an extract from the story. </li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>David Cameron did not understand the controversial reforms and George Osborne regrets not preventing what Downing Street officials call a “huge strategic error”, it can be revealed.</p> <p>One senior cabinet minister told <em>The Times</em>: “We’ve made three mistakes that I regret, the first being restructuring the NHS. The rest are minor.” </p> <p> The prime minister and the chancellor both failed to realise the explosive extent of plans drawn up by Andrew Lansley, when he was the health secretary, which one insider described as “unintelligible gobbledegook”. </p> <p> An ally of Mr Osborne said: “George kicks himself for not having spotted it and stopped it. He had the opportunity then and he didn’t take it.” </p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about this, Hunt said he would not comment on the views attributed to Tory figures in the article. But he said that the NHS was now doing an extra 1m operations a year, and that this was only possible because of the savings obtained by bureaucrat posts axed as a result of the reforms. Asked about George Osborne’s views, Hunt replied: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think if you talked to George Osborne, he would say exactly the same thing. The officially verified figures show that those reforms are saving the NHS more than £1bn a year. That is paying for a lot of doctors and nurses. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Hunt said he would not be taking the proposed 9% pay increase for MPs.</strong><br /></li> </ul> <p>I’ve taken some of the quotes from <a href="http://www.politicshome.com">PoliticsHome.</a></p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="4b1ef519fbe47aeefcf231fc8055c7fa13e55063"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/13/1413189990807/4fa5117c-ff8a-4395-ae20-30ad84188ade-460x276.jpeg" alt="Jeremy Hunt" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Jeremy Hunt</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: ELM/Rex Features/ELM/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id="block-543b89a6e4b042a2462082f8" class="block is-key-event"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-13T09:23:25.205+01:00">9.23am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">OBR boss says income tax revenues likely to be disappointing</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Robert Chote</strong>, chair of the Office of Budget Responsibility, had some bad news for George Osborne on the Today programme this morning. He said income tax receipts were likely to be disappointing this year because wage growth was so low.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Fewer pence of revenue [are] coming in for every pound of wages and salaries that’s generated in the labour market and that’s one of the reasons why the receipts have come in weaker. Now, from the perspective of the public finances, that’s not particularly good news. The chancellor of the exchequer gets more bang for his buck if wages and salaries rise as a result of people’s earnings going up than if employment goes up – and that’s basically because if earnings go up you’re taking more people into higher income tax brackets, whereas if employment is going up you’re perhaps bringing more people in at the bottom.</p> <p>This continued story of earnings growing less rapidly than expected and employment growing more rapidly than expected does perhaps suggest that we are more likely to be disappointed than to overachieve on income tax receipts this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>One factor was the increase in self-employment, he said.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Quite a lot of the employment growth we’ve seen relatively recently has been self-employed people. And the evidence suggests that more of those than we expected have come in on relatively low incomes. So, for example, Revenues and Customs, the tax department, suggest that the proportion of self-employed people who are reporting incomes below the tax-free personal allowance has gone up from about 20% immediately prior to the crisis to about 35%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later <strong>Danny Alexander</strong>, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told the programme that the problem with tax revenues that Chote highlighted could be related to the government’s success at tackling youth unemployment.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>One of the things we are seeing in the UK is a very large fall in youth unemployment. Young people at the start of their careers tend to earn significantly below the median income. That doesn’t mean that those are low-quality jobs. It does mean that those are people who are able to start out in life in the workplace, which is something that is hugely important.</p> </blockquote> <p>I’ve taken the quotes from<a href="http://www.politicshome.com"> PoliticsHome </a>and the Press Association.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="fec4c0c685eea545c1dc68de4206ad2b107b6ac1"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/13/1413188595984/b31da222-e536-4dc6-ae65-cef5700d8bb9-460x276.jpeg" alt="Robert Chote" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Robert Chote</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Lewis Whyld/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id="block-543b8110e4b0468f1ec5ca1e" class="block"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-13T09:05:26.863+01:00">9.05am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The first day when the Commons comes back after a recess is always busy and this afternoon there will be at least two important statements in the chamber. <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, the health secretary, will tell MPs what is being done to prepare Britain for an Ebola outbreak.

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/13/liberia-ebola-health-workers-strike <p>Liberia’s efforts to contain Ebola suffered a further blow on Monday after health workers demanding increased danger money for looking after patients with the disease began their threatened walkout.</p> <p>The National Health Workers Association of Liberia (NHWAL) ignored government pleas to refrain from striking and urged its members to stay off work after midnight on Monday. The call to strike was for nurses, medical assistants, lab technicians and other health workers, but did not include doctors.</p> <p>The NHWAL chairman, Joseph Tamba, said the call had been “massively” followed, adding: “Health workers across the country have downed tools as we asked them to do.”</p> <p><a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Liberia-health-workers-strike-over-Ebola" title="">According to one unconfirmed report</a>, industrial action by those looking after sick people may already have resulted in deaths.</p> <p>In the capital Monrovia, where staff at Island Clinic, the largest government-run Ebola facility, have been on a “go-slow” for three days, a patient quoted on local radio described scenes of desolation with sick people deserted by staff.</p> <p>“We are at the Ebola treatment unit and no one is taking care of us,” the unnamed man said. “Last night several patients died. Those who can walk are trying to escape by climbing over the fence.”</p> <p>Liberia has banned reporters from Ebola clinics, making the claim impossible to verify.</p> <p>Healthcare workers are on the frontline of the worst outbreak on record of Ebola, which spreads through contact with bodily fluids, with 95 killed in Liberia alone, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The west African outbreak has so far killed more than 4,000 people – at least 2,300 of them in Liberia.</p> <p>George Williams, the NHWAL’s secretary general, acknowledged that the strike would undermine the progress being made against Ebola in Liberia, but said he was confident the public would understand the reasons for their action.</p> <p>“The problem is the government. The public should get angry with the government, not with us,” he said.</p> <p>“The public is aware that health workers are dying because they are not protected. Nobody is supposed to die while protecting lives. We have been calling on the government to give us protective gear but they are not doing so.”</p> <p>According to the association, the walkout will involve “every hospital and every health centre including Ebola treatment units”. Although the NHWAL has more than 10,000 members, Liberia’s health ministry says only about 1,000 of those are employed at sites receiving Ebola patients. It has also denied the association’s claims that the government had failed to engage with health workers’ demands.</p> <p>Some health workers chose not to strike. Gobee Logan, a doctor at a government hospital in Tubmanburg, 40 miles (60km) from Monrovia, told the Associated Press that some nurses had turned up for work on Monday.</p> <p>With salaries said to be as low as £155 ($250) a month, calls are mounting for pay to reflect the risk of dealing with Ebola, for which there is no vaccine or widely available treatment.</p> <p>Last week, Liberia’s president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, told a World Bank crisis meeting there was an urgent need for “compensation to healthcare workers who, for fear of the risk involved, have refused or are reluctant to return to work”.</p> <p>On Monday, the WHO described the Ebola crisis out break as “unquestionably the most severe acute public health emergency in modern times”.</p> <p>Its director general, Margaret Chan, said the number of new cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone was rising exponentially, adding: “The world is ill-prepared to respond to any severe, sustained and threatening public health emergency.”</p> <p>In a statement to a regional health conference in the Philippine capital Manila, she said: “I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries. I have never seen an infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/13/spain-ebola-repatriations-nurse <p>Spain’s foreign affairs minister has defended the government’s decision to repatriate two Spanish nationals with Ebola, despite a nurse who treated them becoming the first person to contract the virus outside of west Africa.</p> <p>“The government did what it had to do,” José Manuel García-Margallo told El País newspaper. “The duty of a state is to protect its citizens – and even more so when they are in difficult circumstances far from Spain. All the developed countries who have had this problem have done the same.”</p> <p>The two missionaries, Miguel Pajares, 75, and Manuel García Viejo, 69, died in August and September, days after being evacuated to Madrid for treatment. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-crisis-substandard-equipment-nurse-positive-spain">Spanish nurse Teresa Romero Ramos tested positive for the Ebola virus</a> shortly after. She remains in a stable but serious condition.</p> <p>García-Margallo argued that far from hurting Spain’s image, the Ebola case would show the world the strength of the Spanish healthcare system. “In the face of an event that can happen in any country, Spanish society has demonstrated its solidarity, and in the long run we will see that our healthcare system is among the world’s best.”</p> <p>On Sunday, Fernando Simón, of Spain’s health ministry, said the presence of the virus in Romero Ramos’s blood <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/spanish-ebola-nurse-shows-signs-improvement">appeared to be diminishing</a>. “We have high hopes that the infection is under control,” he said. Fifteen others remain in quarantine in Madrid’s Carlos III hospital, including the nurse’s husband and several health workers who treated her before she tested positive for Ebola. None of them have shown symptoms of the virus.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Global Ebola outbreaks">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1413212395898/Ebola_Outbreaks_WEB141014.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Last week, in a phone interview from her hospital bed, Romero Ramos told El País that she might have touched her face with her gloves while removing her protective suit. She later told the Spanish broadcaster Cuatro that she had been given “little training” on how to put on and take off the suit.</p> <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/10/madrid-hospital-staff-quit-ebola">Complaints of scant training</a> by health workers has led Madrid’s top prosecutor to launch an investigation. The matter was brought before court by workers’ unions, who argue that the Spanish health authorities violated labour laws by failing to provide adequate protection and training for its employees.</p> <p>Amelia Batanero, a nurse who underwent training to treat Ebola patients at the Carlos III, told the Guardian: “We haven’t learned how to use these suits, we don’t know the protocol on how to treat Ebola.”</p> <p>The news that a healthcare worker in Dallas has also contracted the Ebola virus prompted comparisons on Monday between the differing response in each country to the infected health workers.</p> <p>Despite the fact this was the US authorities’ <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/us-ebola-diagnosis-cdc-chief-deeply-concerning">second case of Ebola</a> – after the death of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/texan-healthcare-worker-ebola-thomas-duncan-us">Thomas Eric Duncan</a> in Dallas this month – and had been riddled with missteps, the Spanish media used the news to take aim at their government’s slow response.</p> <p>Romero Ramos contacted health authorities several times over the course of nearly a week before she was tested for Ebola, while the unnamed US healthcare worker was put in quarantine less than 90 minutes after she arrived at a hospital complaining of a slight fever.</p> <p>Many of Romero Ramos’s neighbours learned of the diagnosis through the media, in contrast to the US where authorities contacted the patient’s neighbours to explain the situation. And while a global protest failed to prevent health authorities in Spain from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/threat-to-dog-spanish-nurse-ebola-sparks-online-petition">putting down Romero Ramos’s dog, Excálibur</a>, US authorities facing a similar situation have promise to save the healthcare worker’s dog.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/13/uk-must-ready-ebola-outbreak-worsen-jeremy-hunt <p>Britain must be prepared for the Ebola outbreak to worsen, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has said as he prepares to outline the next steps he intends to take to prevent an outbreak in the UK.</p> <p>Hunt said he would give the latest estimate of the number of cases likely to emerge in the UK in the next three months, when he made a statement in the Commons later on Monday.</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It is a question of being prepared; at present the number of [global] cases is doubling every three to four weeks. At present the numbers are very low, but we have to be prepared for it getting a lot worse.”</p> <p>Hunt praised the 650 NHS staff who had “volunteered to put themselves in harm’s way to go out to west Africa – one of the most dangerous places in the world healthwise”.</p> <p>He said the advice from Public Health England was that the risk of Ebola to people living in the UK remained low.</p> <p>“I think there are a lot of misunderstandings and that’s why it’s very important that we get the right training in place and put in place the right procedures.”</p> <p>He said the main purpose of passenger screening at airports was to identify people who were at higher risk of carrying the disease. “Because the virus incubates for 21 days we need to make sure that anyone that is higher risk – we know their contact details, we are able to stay in touch with them, monitor their temperature on a daily basis so that if they do develop the symptoms we can get to them quickly.</p> <p>“You pick up on those people by making sure that you have proper interviews of people who may be higher risk when they arrive in the UK so that you have those details.”</p> <p>Hunt said he hoped doctors worried about being exposed to Ebola would be reassured by measures he would announce on Monday.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Global Ebola outbreaks">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1413212395898/Ebola_Outbreaks_WEB141014.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>“This is not an airborne virus, you need an exchange of bodily fluids to catch it. But we need to make sure that everyone gets the training, everyone is reassured about what they need to do to stay safe.”</p> <p>As part of the country’s strategy to deal with the virus, calls to the NHS’s non-emergency <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/13/ebola-nhs-111-callers-screened-symptoms-uk">111 phoneline were to be screened for possible Ebola sufferers</a>.</p> <p>Call handlers on the service would question anyone ringing up with possible symptoms of the disease about their recent travel history, to see if they had been to west Africa, where the death toll has passed 4,000 people, Hunt announced on Sunday.</p> <p>The news came as the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/texan-healthcare-worker-ebola-thomas-duncan-us">US announced its second case of the disease</a>, in a Texas hospital worker who was in contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, who died from the virus on Wednesday.</p> <p>Hunt said the UK had “robust and well-tested systems” for dealing with Ebola cases entering the country. “However, we keep the need for further measures under review and will never be complacent – and so I asked for additional steps to be taken by NHS 111.</p> <p>“Now all call handlers on the NHS 111 service are asking anyone reporting potential symptoms of Ebola, such as respiratory problems, high temperatures, or diarrhoea and vomiting, about their recent travel history, so appropriate help can be given to people who might be at higher risk of having come into contact with the virus.</p> <p>“If the person with symptoms has recently been to west Africa and is at high risk of having been in contact with Ebola, 111 will immediately refer them to local emergency services for assessment by ambulance personnel with appropriate protective equipment.”</p> <p>The UK’s chief medical officer, Sally Davies, said the country should expect a handful of Ebola cases in the coming months and that a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/11/ebola-crisis-uk-readiness-virus-assessed-nationwide-exercise">major exercise to test the country’s readiness</a> for such cases proved plans were robust.</p> <p>Enhanced screening for the virus at major airports and terminals are part of the government’s contingency plan against Ebola.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/13/cairns-nurse-in-ebola-scare-urges-volunteers-to-fight-virus-in-west-africa <p>The nurse at the centre of the Australian Ebola scare has urged other health professionals to travel to West Africa to help fight the virus.<br /></p> <p>Sue Ellen Kovack, 57, was released from Cairns hospital on Monday after returning a second negative result for the virus. Kovack returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone last Tuesday and was taken to hospital on Thursday after developing a low-grade fever, sparking fears she could have brought the virus to Australia.</p> <p>The federal government has given $18m to fight Ebola, which has killed more than 4,000 people, but has said it will not send aid workers to West Africa <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/ebola-crisis-australia-wont-send-doctors-into-harms-way-abbott">for fear of putting Australian lives at risk</a>.</p> <p>In her first public statement since being admitted to hospital Kovack urged Australians to donate to the Red Cross to send more help to West Africa.</p> <p>“It has been so inspiring and it has really kept me going in the past few days to know there’s growing public support for action to help people affected by Ebola in West Africa,” she said.</p> <p>“Most importantly to me, I’m sending a message to my fellow medical professionals who are thinking about heading over to treat the sick and work at bringing Ebola under control: please, please do it.”</p> <p>Kovack said the support she had received from around the world had made the past week “quite emotional”.</p> <p>“The past few days have been a worrying and taxing time and it has meant I’ve not had much time to fully process the challenges I had in West Africa, treating people sick with Ebola, seeing people die and helping to control this dreadful virus,” she said.</p> <p>The Public Health Association of Australia (PHAA) is sending a letter to Tony Abbott, signed by health professors, urging more direct help for countries affected by Ebola.</p> <p>“The best means of protecting Australia and other high-income countries is for robust control efforts at the source of the outbreak,” the letter says.</p> <p>“The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a global health catastrophe which threatens future economic prosperity, regional political stability and human health globally. It is in our national interest to ensure the epidemic is contained.”</p> <p>The letter was circulated to health professors on Friday afternoon and gained 30 signatures within two hours, PHAA chief executive Michael Moore said.</p> <p>He said the association had purposefully restricted the letter to health professors as they did not want to turn it into a petition.</p> <p>“These are the people who understand the risks, people with serious expertise in this area believe it is important and appropriate for Australia to send health professionals over there,” Moore told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>Moore said non-government organisations in west Africa needed personnel and facilities. He said only 10-20% of Ebola patients were being treated in treatment centres and that number needed to rise to about 70% to stop the virus spreading more quickly.</p> <p>He said while Abbott had valid concerns about the safety of Australian health workers, the logistics could be worked out.</p> <p>“Evacuation of any of our people who contract Ebola is of course the concern and it’s a sensible concern the prime minister has raised, but we’re not beyond being able to organise with the United Kingdom, the United States, Norway, France, other countries who have evacuation systems in place to be able to work with them to deal with this sort of situation,” Moore said.</p> <p>He said Australia had evacuation plans in place with allies for soldiers seriously injured in the Middle East conflicts and could make similar arrangements in West Africa.</p> <p>Asked why Australia seemed more willing to intervene in military conflicts than health crises, Moore said: “It’s politically great to be seen to be strong [by intervening militarily], Maggie Thatcher showed that, but this is a crisis we don’t seem to be strong on.”</p> <p>“If you look at it from a selfish perspective, people seem to be thinking why are we worrying? It’s just Africa’.”</p> <p>The PHAA will circulate the letter until Tuesday and send it to the prime minister on Wednesday.</p> <p>Moore said he was “disappointed” one of the people he had sent the letter to had leaked it to the media before the prime minister had seen it.</p> <p>“I feel it’s impolite,” he said.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/ebola-healthcare-workers-alive-africa <p>Health workers on the Ebola frontline are and always have been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/-sp-ebola-west-africa-health-workers" title="">at the highest risk of contracting the disease</a>. Ebola becomes more contagious the sicker patients get. By the time they are in the care of doctors and nurses, patients have become a serious danger to the lives of those treating, washing and attempting to rehydrate them.</p> <p>But in countries such as the US and Spain, which have sophisticated healthcare systems and well-equipped hospitals, healthcare workers should be safe. It is shocking that workers in Spain and now Texas have contracted Ebola from patients they were treating.</p> <p>As Médecins sans Frontières has proved, it is possible to keep health workers safe even in the difficult setting of west Africa, where an isolation ward can be no more than an area behind a canvas tent flap. The vital elements are vigilance and strict adherence to the rules.</p> <p>The Texas health worker was reportedly wearing full protective gear – gown, gloves, mask and shield – while providing care for the patient who later died. Either that equipment failed or correct procedures were not followed.</p> <p>Dr Tom Frieden, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suggested on Sunday that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/texan-healthcare-worker-ebola-thomas-duncan-us" title="">there had been a breach in protocol,</a> saying that one focus of the investigation will be the possibility that the health worker took off protective gear incorrectly.</p> <p>Personal protective suits keep the virus off the body but removing them safely is a skill in itself. It is possible to transfer the virus from the outside of the suit on to the hands. From there it takes a moment’s thoughtlessness to touch the face. The virus enters the body through eyes, nose or mouth or any abrasion on the skin.</p> <p>In Africa it is so much harder to be safe. The suits are hot, there are not enough available, and doctors and nurses are hard-pressed because there are too few of them to cope with the soaring number of cases. In Liberia there was a critical health worker shortage even before Ebola broke out. Fear over dangerous working conditions was as strong a motivation for recent strikes as very low pay. The government in June doubled the pay of nurses because of the hazard, but was told by the World Bank to rescind the offer, which would have busted the health budget.</p> <p>Better conditions for health workers in Africa are vital. That is going to have to involve increasing their number and improving training. There will still be, for a while, a shortage of experienced people to supervise and ensure procedures are followed. West Africa needs a great deal of help from the west.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/texan-healthcare-worker-ebola-thomas-duncan-us <p>A Texas healthcare worker who provided care for Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient to be given a diagnosis of Ebola in the US, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan">who died on Wednesday</a>, has tested positive for the deadly virus.</p> <p>At a Sunday morning press conference at the hospital, it was confirmed that a close contact of the healthcare worker – who officials said was wearing full protective gear when he or she made contact with Duncan – has also been placed, “proactively”, in isolation. The new case is the first person-to-person transmission of the disease in the US.</p> <p>Dr Tom Frieden, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the diagnosis of the healthcare worker showed there had been a clear breach of safety protocol at the hospital.</p> <p>“We’re deeply concerned about this new development,” Frieden said on CBS. “I think the fact that we don’t know of a breach in protocol is concerning because clearly there was a breach in protocol. We have the ability to prevent the spread of Ebola by caring safely for patients.”</p> <p>The worker was reported to be in stable condition in isolation at the Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas. The hospital is no longer taking any other emergency patients.<br /></p> <p>Frieden told CBS the worker had treated Duncan multiple times after the Liberian man was diagnosed, and said that all those who had treated Duncan were now considered to be potentially exposed. <br /></p> <p>At a subsequent media briefing, Frieden said the healthcare worker had not been able to identify a breach in protocol during his or her contact with Duncan. He also said the healthcare worker is not one of 48 people who have been being monitored because of contact with Duncan.</p> <p>Healthcare workers treating Duncan were to follow CDC protocol that included wearing protective gear. Among the things CDC will investigate, Frieden said, is how the workers took off that gear – because removing it incorrectly can lead to a contamination.</p> <p>At the hospital press conference, Dallas County judge Clay Jenkins said the healthcare worker was a “heroic person who provided care for Mr Duncan” but did not release his or her name. News of the second diagnosis broke overnight, after a preliminary blood test on the healthcare worker, who had reported a low-grade fever on Friday night.<br /></p> <p>On Sunday morning Dr Dan Varga, of Texas Health Presbyterian hospital, said the worker had been “following a self-monitoring regimen prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention” (CDC) and that “the entire process from the patient’s self-monitoring to the admission to isolation took less than 90 minutes”.<br /></p> <p>He added: “The patient’s condition is stable. In addition, a close contact has also been proactively placed in isolation. The caregiver and the family have requested total privacy, so we can’t discuss any more details of the situation.”</p> <p>Dr Varga said the hospital was now not taking any other emergency patients. Answering questions, he said the healthcare worker had been wearing full protective gear and following all CDC guidelines when he or she made contact with Duncan.</p> <p>Mike Rawlings, the mayor of Dallas, addressed likely public fears brought about by the second case. He said: “We heard about this around midnight and have been working throughout the morning to make sure the citizens of Dallas are safe when they wake up. I believe I can say they are.”</p> <p>Rawlings detailed protective measures taken by the city, including the Dallas fire and rescue haz-mat team “clearing up and decontaminating any of the open areas of an apartment complex” and “standing by to make sure nobody enters that apartment complex”.</p> <p>“Furthermore,” he said, “we have knocked on every door in that block and talked to every person who came to the door to explain what has happened and what we have done.”</p> <p>Rawlings said there was believed to be a pet inside the apartment of the healthcare worker now in isolation. He said the pet was not believed to show any signs of Ebola, and that authorities would take care of it. This week in Spain,<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/excalibur-spanish-ebola-patient-dog-euthanised"> a dog owned by an Ebola patient was euthanised</a>.</p> <p>A neighbour, Cliff Lawson, 57, told Reuters he was woken at 6am by two Dallas police officers, who told him “don’t panic”. </p> <p>“I went back to bed after that. There’s nothing you can do about it. You can’t wrap your house in bubble wrap,” Lawson said. </p> <p>A hospital statement detailed the steps taken by the hospital since the admission of Duncan, on 28 September, on his second visit.</p> <p>“We have known that further cases of Ebola are a possibility among those who were in contact with Mr Duncan before he passed away last week,” the statement said. “The system of monitoring, quarantine and isolation was established to protect those who cared for Mr Duncan as well as the community at large by identifying any potential ebola cases as early as possible and getting those individuals into treatment immediately.” <br /></p> <p>Duncan travelled from Liberia to the US on 19 September to join his girlfriend, Louise Troh, the mother of his son, Karsiah. After falling ill a few days later, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/10/thomas-duncan-ebola-medical-records-high-fever">Duncan was initially sent home from hospital</a>, despite telling a nurse he had recently travelled from west Africa. He was taken by ambulance to Texas Health Presbyterian on 28 September, where he was admitted and placed in isolation.</p> <p>He was confirmed to have Ebola two days later.</p> <p>It is believed Duncan contracted the disease while helping take his landlord’s 19-year-old daughter to an Ebola treatment ward in Monrovia. He did not declare that he had been in contact with Ebola when he completed a pre-flight questionnaire at Monrovia airport before travelling to the US.</p> <p>On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/us-airports-ebola-screenings-west-africa">the White House announced that passengers travelling from west Africa will face additional Ebola screenings at five US airports</a>, amid mounting concern that not enough controls were in place to prevent the deadly disease from entering the US.</p> <p>The current outbreak of Ebola has killed more than 4,000 people in west Africa.</p> <p>In his opening remarks on Sunday, judge Jenkins sought to calm public fears. He said: “I want to stress an important fact. You cannot contract Ebola other than from bodily fluids of a symptomatic Ebola victim. You cannot contract Ebola by walking by people in the street or from contacts who are not symptomatic. There is nothing about this case that changes that basic premise of science. <br /></p> <p>“And so it’s important that while this is obviously bad news, it is not news that should bring about panic. We have a strategy to monitor this and we will go to that strategy to keep the community safe.”</p> <p>The hospital said it was “triple-checking our full compliance with updated CDC guidelines. We are also continuing to monitor all staff who had some relation to Mr. Duncan’s care even if they are not assumed to be at significant risk of infection”.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/ebola-boris-johnson-uk-london <p>Boris Johnson has said there is little doubt a case of Ebola will come to the UK and this will most probably be in London.</p> <p>The London mayor also admitted health checks at UK airports were a “far from perfect solution” and cautioned the government against seeming to “promise stuff that doesn’t really make any sense”.</p> <p>As the outbreak continues to spread across west Africa, Johnson suggested the best thing the UK could do was to be prepared for a new case of the virus when it happens.</p> <p>“I have little doubt that eventually there will be a case of Ebola in this country and probably this city,” he told the BBC’s the Andrew Marr Show. “All I can tell you is that to the best of my knowledge … we have fantastic preparations in London for this. We have very good healthcare in this city, considerably better, alas, than they have in Africa.”</p> <p>David Cameron initially resisted the idea of screening for Ebola at key airports and ports, but soon afterwards he ordered health checks on passengers entering the UK from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, the three worst-affected west African nations, following a change in the medical advice.</p> <p>Although there are no direct routes to the UK from these countries, people who have taken connecting flights will face questionnaires and medical assessments, but not temperatures checks as in the US.</p> <p>The guidance changed a few days after a Spanish nurse became the first person to contract the illness on European soil while caring for two repatriated missionaries who had been working in west Africa.</p> <p>But the screening has come in for criticism from some quarters, as incoming passengers may not yet display symptoms of Ebola when they are being screened.</p> <p>Johnson added his voice to criticism, saying he understood “why people don’t understand” the new protection measures.</p> <p>“You can’t blood test everybody coming into the country … I can only go on the advice I’ve been given and that is that although I think we are doing a lot more screening, we don’t think temperature measures alone will be of any use because you could after all be in the early stages of incubation of the virus and have two or three weeks to run.</p> <p>“The idea of screening at airports is, I’m afraid, far from perfect as a solution. What you need to do is make sure people coming from the affected countries are properly screened, properly tested when they leave. They shouldn’t be allowed to leave if they have been in contact with people in one of the affected areas. And obviously we should be putting on preparations here.”</p> <p>On Saturday, Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said it would not be surprising if there was a “spillover” of Ebola into the UK, adding that she would “expect a handful of cases in the next few months”.</p> <p>Medical staff and the emergency services have conducted a disaster preparation exercise this weekend to prepare for a potential outbreak, with hospitals now on standby.</p> <p>Earlier, Cameron promised steps were being taken to “keep our own people safe here in the UK”, adding: “What we do is we listen to the medical advice and we act on that advice and that’s why we’re introducing the screening processes at the appropriate ports and airports.”</p> <p>Britain has also sent about 175 military personnel to Africa to help with efforts to contain the disease.</p> <p>In a round of broadcast interviews, David Nabarro, the United Nations special envoy on Ebola, said the global authorities have given themselves three months to get the virus under control.</p> <p>He said it was spreading “exponentially” across west Africa but there was a very good chance of meeting this target of seeing the number of new cases reduce week by week by next year.</p> <p>Speaking on Sky News’s Murnaghan programme, Andrew Mitchell, a senior Conservative and former international development secretary, called on the world to line up behind the UN to tackle Ebola in Africa and increase its containment efforts twentyfold.</p> <p>The UK has already been contributed significantly to the global Ebola fighting fund, but it will need to carry on taking a lead in Sierra Leone, he added.</p> <p>“It is very important that the principal countries with historic links in the area are very fully engaged. Sierra Leone is a country with which Britain has very deep and long historic links, Liberia the same thing is true of America, Guinea has French connections.</p> <p>“We need the EU and those three countries in particular to champion the effort inside these countries in west Africa … This is absolutely critical because this is a threat to all of us, it needs to be contained in west Africa. People are very frightened there. There is danger of significant migration in the region and wider than that and that is why containment is so important.”</p> <p>He added that the reaction of the world to crises such as Ebola was “almost always behind the curve, too slow”, but that the international community was now doing the right thing of by rapidly increasing aid efforts in Africa.</p> <p>Labour criticised Johnson for raising the possibility of a UK Ebola outbreak and failing to provide solid reassurances.</p> <p>Luciana Berger, the party’s public health spokeswoman, said: “People don’t want to see politicians on TV speculating about an Ebola outbreak, before passing the buck. After the past week they want reassurance that robust preparations are being made. Boris Johnson should focus on explaining what plans are in place.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/ebola-crisis-australia-wont-send-doctors-into-harms-way-abbott <p>The Australian government will not send doctors or nurses to west Africa to help contain the Ebola crisis until it is certain “all of the risks are being properly managed”, the prime minister, Tony Abbott, has said.</p> <p>Figures released on Saturday by the World Health Organisation show that more than 4,000 people have died in the Ebola epidemic that broke out in west Africa in March, out of a total of 8,399 registered cases. The death toll includes 233 health workers.</p> <p>International health organisations such as Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) have criticised the Abbott government’s “underwhelming” response to the outbreak, which has included cash grants to MSF, the World Health Organisation and British front line efforts in Sierra Leone – but no Australian medical personnel. </p> <p>Save the Children has called on the government to follow the lead of the Obama administration and send troops to help manage the response to the epidemic, which has claimed over 2,300 lives in Liberia alone.</p> <p>But Abbott said on Sunday that the latest death toll would not change the government’s view on sending Australian health workers. </p> <p>“We aren’t going to send Australian doctors and nurses into harm’s way without being absolutely confident that all of the risks are being properly managed. And at the moment we cannot be confident that that is the case,” the prime minister said.</p> <p>Abbott said he “admired the selfless humanitarianism” of the dozens of Australian doctors and nurses currently working in west Africa with non-government organisations. But there was “a world of difference” between that and “ordering Australian personnel to go into a situation without the kind of risk minimisation strategies that any responsible Australian government would have to put it place”.</p> <p>Containing the Ebola outbreak had been considered “on a number of occasions” by the cabinet national security committee and people arriving in Australia from west Africa were being “carefully screened … and that will continue”.</p> <p>“But I do want to stress it would be irresponsible of the Australian government to order our personnel into harm’s way without all appropriate precautions being in place, and at this time, they simply aren’t and they can’t be,” he said.</p> <p>An Australian nurse, Sue-Ellen Kovack, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/10/ebola-australian-nurse-returns-negative-blood-test">tested negative for the virus on Friday</a>, after checking into a Cairns hospital with a low-grade fever following her return from a humanitarian mission to Sierra Leone. </p> <p>Australian quarantine officers <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/ebola-airport-screening-australia">revealed on Thursday</a> they have held six people suspected of having Ebola at airports, after interviewing 651 travellers in the past few months as part of efforts to keep the disease from spreading into the country.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/12/ebola-survivor-now-i-am-helping-others-fight-the-disease <p>It all started with a severe headache and a fever. Then, later, I began to vomit and I got diarrhoea. My father was ill and my mother too. My niece, my fiancé and my sister had also all fallen sick. We all felt helpless.</p> <p>It was my uncle who first contracted the virus in our family. He contracted it from a woman he helped take to hospital. He got sick and called our father for help, and our father went to him to bring him to a hospital for treatment. A few days after our father came back, he too got sick. We all cared for him and got infected too. This is the way the virus works, person by person, cutting through families.</p> <p>On 21 August, my whole family and I made our way to an Ebola treatment centre in Monrovia. When we arrived at the unit, the nurses took my mother and me to the same tent. My fiancé, my sister, my father and my niece were taken to separate tents. My sister was pregnant and had a miscarriage.</p> <p>They took our blood and we waited for them to announce the results. After the lab test, I was confirmed positive. Your first thought is that this is the end of the world. I was afraid, because we had heard people say that if you catch Ebola, you die. The rest of my family also tested positive for the virus.</p> <p>After a few days in the isolation ward, my condition became worse. My mother was also fighting for her life. She was in a terrible state. At that point, the nurses made the decision to move me to another tent. By then, I barely understood what was going on around me. I was unconscious. I was helpless. The nurses had to bathe me, change my clothes and feed me. I was vomiting constantly and I was very weak.</p> <p>Severe pains were shooting inside my body. The feeling was overpowering: Ebola is like a sickness from a different planet. It comes with so much pain, and it <em>causes</em> so much pain that you can feel it deep in your bones.</p> <p>While I was battling for my life, my mother died though I didn’t know at the time. It was only one week later, when I had started recovering, that the nurses told me that she had passed away. I was sad, but I had to accept that it had happened. A few days later, my father passed away too. I was shocked that I had lost both my parents. But God spared my life from the disease, as well as the lives of my sister, my niece and my fiancé.</p> <p>God could not have allowed the entire family to perish. He kept us alive for a purpose. I am grateful to the workers here for their care. They are very good people. The care, the medication and self-encouragement can also help a patient to survive. When you’re sick with Ebola, there’s always a need for encouragement. Take your medication; drink enough fluids – whether it’s oral rehydration solution, or water or juices – but don’t keep your system empty. Even if they bring you food and you don’t have any appetite to eat, just eat the soup.</p> <p>After 18 days in the treatment centre, the nurses came in one morning and took my blood and carried it to the laboratory for testing. Later that evening, around 5pm, I saw them return. They came and announced that I was ready to go home because I had tested negative. Then I felt that my life had begun again.</p> <p>I arrived back home feeling happy, but my neighbours were still afraid of me. A few of them welcomed me back; others are still afraid to be around me – they say that I still have Ebola. There was a particular group that kept calling our house “Ebola home”. But, to my surprise, I saw one of the ladies in the group come to my house to ask me to take her mother to the treatment centre. I did it, and I felt happy that at least she knows now that someone cannot go to a supermarket to <em>buy</em> Ebola. It’s a disease that anyone, any family, can get. If someone has Ebola, it isn’t good to stigmatise them, because you don’t know who is next in line to contract the virus.</p> <p>Now I am back at the treatment centre, helping people who are suffering from the virus to recover, working as a mental health counsellor. Helping people brings pleasure, and that is what brought me here. My efforts here may help other people to survive. When I am on a shift, I counsel my patients. If a patient doesn’t want to eat, I encourage them to eat. If they are weak and are unable to bathe on their own, I help to bathe them. I help them with all my might because I understand the experience – I’ve been through the very same thing.</p> <p>I feel happy in my new role. I treat my patients as if they are my children. I talk to them about my own experiences. I tell them my story to inspire them and to let them know that they too can survive. My elder brother and my sister are happy for me to work here. They support me in this 100%. Even though our parents didn’t survive the virus, we can help other people to recover.</p> <p><em>Salomé Karwah is an Ebola survivor turned carer at Médecins sans Frontières’ Ebola Treatment Centre in Monrovia</em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/cuba-leads-fights-against-ebola-africa <p>As the official number of Ebola deaths in west Africa’s crisis topped 4,000 last week – experts say the actual figure is at least twice as high – the UN issued a stark call to arms. Even to simply slow down the rate of infection, the international humanitarian effort would have to increase massively, warned secretary-general Ban Ki-moon.</p> <p>“We need a 20-fold resource mobilisation,” he said. “We need at least a 20-fold surge in assistance – mobile laboratories, vehicles, helicopters, protective equipment, trained medical personnel, and medevac capacities.”</p> <p>But big hitters such as China or Brazil, or former colonial powers such France and the UK, have not been stepping up to the plate. Instead, the single biggest medical force on the Ebola frontline has been a small island: Cuba.</p> <p>That a nation of 11 million people, with a GDP of $6,051 per capita, is leading the effort says much of the international response. A brigade of 165 Cuban health workers arrived in Sierra Leone last week, the first batch of a total of 461. In sharp contrast, western governments have appeared more focused on stopping the epidemic at their borders than actually stemming it in west Africa. The international effort now struggling to keep ahead of the burgeoning cases might have nipped the outbreak in the bud had it come earlier.</p> <p>André Carrilho, an illustrator whose work has appeared in the <em>New York Times </em>and <em>Vanity Fair</em>, noted the moment when the background hum of Ebola coverage suddenly turned into a shrill panic. Only in August, after two US missionaries caught the disease while working in Liberia and were flown to Atlanta, did the mushrooming crisis come into clear focus for many in the west.</p> <p>“Suddenly we could put a face and a name to these patients, something that I had not felt before. To top it all, an experimental drug was found and administered in record time,” explained the Lisbon-based artist. “I started thinking on how I could depict what I perceived to be a deep imbalance between the reporting on the deaths of hundreds of African patients and the personal tragedy of just two westerners.”</p> <p>The result was a striking illustration: a sea of beds filled with black African patients writhing in agony, while the media notice only the single white patient.</p> <p>“It’s natural that people care more about what’s happening closer to their lives and realities,” Carrilho said. “But I also think we all have a responsibility to not view what is not our immediate problem as a lesser problem. The fact that thousands of deaths in Africa are treated as a statistic, and that one or two patients inside our borders are reported in all their individual pain, should be cause for reflection.”</p> <p>With the early alarm bells ignored, the handful of international health agencies which did act were quickly overwhelmed, allowing Ebola to slip across the border of Guinea and gather pace in Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>The sentiment behind Carrilho’s illustration neatly encapsulates a renewed media frenzy now that as two cases have been imported into the US, and a Spanish nurse infected over the past month.</p> <p>“What I’d like to see is a little less hysteria in the US and the UK,” said Andrew Gleadle, programme director for the International Medical Corps (IMC), which recruits health personnel for global humanitarian disasters, as he snatched a breather between shifts in Sierra Leone. “We may get a few isolated cases [in the west] but we’re not going to get an epidemic. We need more focus on west Africa where the real problem is.”</p> <p>The WHO estimates Sierra Leone alone needs around 10,000 health workers. Médecins sans Frontières, the international medical aid charity which has led efforts from the beginning, has about 250 staff on the ground in the affected countries. The second-largest government brigade is from the African Union, which is dispatching about 100 health workers.</p> <p>It’s not the first time Cuba has played an outsized role in a major disaster. Its government may be beset by allegations of human rights abuse, but its contribution to relief brigades is unrivalled: currently, some 50,000 Cuban-trained health workers are spread over 66 countries. Cuba provided the largest medical contingent after the Haiti earthquake disaster in 2010, providing care to almost 40% of the victims. And while some 400 US doctors volunteered in the aftermath of that quake, fewer than 10 had registered for the IMC’s Ebola effort, the organisation said.</p> <p>Sierra Leone president Ernest Bai Koroma personally welcomed the Cuban delegation in the capital Freetown. “This is a friendship that we have experienced since the 1970s and today you have demonstrated that you are a great friend of the country,” he said as they gathered in a room draped with the Cuban flag.</p> <p>In August 1960, Che Guevara, a former doctor, dreamed of a world in which every medic would “[utilise] the technical knowledge of his profession in the service of the revolution and the people”. Thus began a history of service in some the world’s poorest and most forgotten states.</p> <p>The island nation began forging links with the continent during the 1960s, when Cuban soldiers fought alongside southern Africa’s liberation fighters. Guevara personally pitched into the brutal battlefields of the newly independent Democratic Republic of Congo, but after becoming suspicious about rebel leaders’ motives, suggested they replaced fighters with medical aid.</p> <p>Ties deepened in the 1970s as Africa’s newly independent nations flirted with socialism, and aligned themselves with the communist state who opposed their former colonial rulers. Teachers, doctors and soldiers from Cuba poured into 17 African countries.</p> <p>Today, fading signposts with Spanish street names, peeling posters with improbable slogans (“Viva la revolución siempre!” – long live the revolution, always – says one in Freetown) and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/05/salsa-music-boom-benin-african-roots" title="">a love of salsa music</a> remain across much of west Africa.</p> <p>But help will soon be coming from places other than Cuba. The US will pour in $400m, plans to build at least a dozen 100-bed field hospitals using some 4,000 troops, and has deployed 65 health officials to Liberia. Japan, the world’s fourth-richest nation, has pledged $40m and India $13m. China has chipped in around $5m, as well as a Chinese-built and staffed mobile clinic in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>But even if efforts to roughly double the current bed capacity of about 1,000 in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone succeed, these facilities will still lack the health personnel needed to staff them.</p> <p>In part, slow staff recruitment is down to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/-sp-ebola-west-africa-health-workers" title="">the high number of medics who have already been infected</a>, hovering around 300 so far.</p> <p>“Even if you know what you’re doing, people make mistakes. It’s very, very difficult to wear those suits in hot weather,” said Chikwe Ihekweazu, an epidemiologist who worked with the WHO during the 2004 outbreak in Sudan, where temperatures can soar up to 42C.</p> <p>“A lot of health workers died in the beginning and that obviously had an impact on recruitment. But the rates have fallen, and what that shows is that health workers can learn, with the correct training in infection control.”</p> <p>Others are also hopeful that staff numbers will increase. Gleadle, of the IMC, said the slow pace at which centres were being scaled up might actually draw in more volunteers in the long run.</p> <p>He said: “Even if we have a 100-bed centre, you wouldn’t fill them up in one day. You start slowly, then take a deep breath and escalate over time. I think as we build more treatment centres and hopefully none of our workers fall ill because we’re going slowly, that will encourage others.”</p> <p>And he pointed out that there would be a silver lining, of sorts, as the disease marched on. “One way to see a positive side is that it means there are more survivors with immunity. They can then be very, very valuable in going back to their communities to educate others and help, without that risk of falling sick again.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/12/ebola-drugs-medical-research-trial-placebo <p>As global anxiety over the Ebola epidemic mounts, scientists are close to being able to test new, experimental treatments on patients with this terrible disease. These potential treatments need to be assessed for efficacy as quickly and as robustly as possible. Thousands of lives depend upon it. Unfortunately, this process may be fatally delayed by a misguided insistence upon the use of randomised control trials (RCTs).</p> <p>RCTs are often considered the gold standard of biomedical research. The idea is simple: half the participants in the trial, randomly selected, get the experimental treatment, while the other half are given the standard of care. Neither patients nor the researchers know who is on which “arm” of the trial. This avoids bias and gives researchers a control against which to judge whether the new treatment works. RCTs are said to be ethical because the risk to which participants are exposed can be justified by the production of data robust enough to advance medical science and treatment.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Ebola presents us with a situation in which conducting RCTs as usual really isn’t ethical. In fact, it’s wrong. When we conduct RCTs, we have to be able to say that we genuinely don’t know if the treatment is any better than the standard of care. It’s simply not like that with Ebola.</p> <p>This Ebola epidemic has a mortality rate of about 70%. Standard of care, despite incredible heroics from public health workers, still mostly results in death. When there is no cure, it is unethical to ask people to be assigned a trial arm that not only holds out no chance of benefit, but that is more than likely a death sentence.</p> <p>We went through this with HIV/Aids in the 1980s. Then, activists taught medical researchers that a random assignment to possible treatment or certain death just wasn’t OK. Of course, the experimental treatments for Ebola might be useless, as some were for HIV, but we don’t know that for sure. What we do know is that there is the very real possibility of benefit. That possibility, in the face of this lethal outbreak, makes it wrong to ask people to take a placebo pill “for science”.</p> <p>However, as a group of leading scientists and public health officials wrote recently in the <em>Lancet</em> there are other ways to produce the robust scientific data we need to combat Ebola. They rightly called for using an adaptive trial design that compares different experimental treatments in different settings. These are assessed against historical and epidemiological data and can be rolled out without too much disruption to fragile public health systems. Adapting quickly to emerging findings, ineffective treatments can be abandoned and more effective ones expanded to new areas. After this, RCTs could ethically be introduced where participants are randomised to one of two experimental treatments shown to work to some extent. These RCTs would be to assess which works best, not whether a treatment works at all. This enables us to produce good data without asking Ebola patients, the majority of whom will die, to forgo the chance (even the small chance) of treatment.</p> <p>To fight Ebola, we need to act fast and we need to act ethically. RCTs would stop us doing either.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/12/ebola-sierra-leone-fighting-war-against-unseen-virus <p>As evening fell, localised lightning illuminated the palm trees and mango trees along the Atlantic coast beach near Aberdeen, a western neighbourhood in Freetown. These are the remnants of a long rainy season that will soon finish. The flashes in the sky and the booming thunder were not mortar shells or rocket launchers.</p> <p>The sound of an approaching helicopter shook the foundations of small homes and commercial storefronts as it hovered and landed at a small airstrip near downtown Freetown. The black and white “reverend” birds bid a hasty retreat. The beating blades slowed and the flags settled back into their drowsy droop. There were no soldiers on board the UN’s helicopter, but men in dark suits and gleaming white shirts emerged to stroll across the tarmac to a line of waiting SUVs. The helicopter and vehicles are not military issue.</p> <p>The traffic slows and the crowds thicken as vehicles approach the third checkpoint on a stretch of road just outside the eastern boundaries of Freetown. Street hawkers offer bananas, boiled eggs and cold drinks to passengers and drivers. Police and military personnel guide vehicles, cars, trucks and non-governmental SUVs to one side of the road and ask occupants to slip down and proceed to a tarp-covered shack beside the metal barricades. Travellers are asked to wash their hands and submit to an infrared thermometer temperature check. Security forces are not looking for weapons or rebels but for a possibly more deadly opponent – the Ebola virus.</p> <p>In an address to a World Bank round table, the president of Sierra Leone, Ernest Bai Koroma, stated “… the fight on the ground in Sierra Leone urgently needs the support of people gathered here today to combat this virus; without you we cannot succeed, without your quick response, a tragedy unforeseen in modern times would threaten the wellbeing and compromise the security of people everywhere.”</p> <p>Is Sierra Leone at war? Despite the war-like language – “fight”, “combat”, “tragedy” – Sierra Leone is not fighting itself or a visible, hostile enemy. Sierra Leone is racing against an unseen, proliferating virus. “This is a race to get ahead of this evil virus; this is a race for all of us,” said the president. Sierra Leone is not sprinting, but readying itself for a marathon.</p> <p>On Friday 10 October, Sierra Leone recorded its highest official number of deaths in one day – 140. Body retrieval teams, laboratories and gravediggers work at a furious pace. Treatment centres are being constructed across the nation. Nurses are busy with training sessions … and treating patients. Seaports and airports are overwhelmed by incoming supplies from China, Britain, Cuba, the US and Europe.</p> <p>At the moment Sierra Leone is behind in the race. At the moment the international community, local institutions and organisations are lagging. And, like a tiring racer, the country is struggling to keep up.</p> <p>Juliet Nyanah Manna, 32, runs a small “tarp and stick” cookery shop on the beach near Lumley in the west of Freetown. Manna’s business has slowed to a trickle … a slowly retreating tide that has her wondering when she’ll get her next meal or pay her rent. “Business is slow. People are not out. And even when people come for drinks the police drive them away insisting ‘No gathering. This is a state of emergency’,” she says. Manna is a single mother and she’s looking for other business opportunities. She says: “I have to change my business to find money.”</p> <p>Across the beach road from her cookery shop is a long line of mall shops and restaurants. All of the windows are boarded up. It feels and looks a bit like a ghost town or a cold, deserted resort locale. The parking area along the street is bereft of vehicles and street traffic is almost non-existent. Manna lists on her fingers, as she points up and down the street, all the shop owners who’ve left the country and abandoned their businesses. She stays because she has very few other options.</p> <p>Mary Kamara, 43, was an education programme assistant with a local NGO before the first cases of Ebola were reported in the country. She is now unemployed. Her NGO was funded by an international NGO which is now channeling all its funding to Ebola-related activities. “When this sickness happened,” says Kamara, “I knew I had to find another way to support my family.” She is now selling used clothes and has found a niche market in her small community. Kamara’s sister, Isha, buys a large bale of “junx” (clothes donated to organisations in the US, UK, or Canada and imported to Sierra Leone) from a Lebanese businessman in downtown Freetown. Together, Mary and Isha sort the clothes and pile bundles of T-shirts, sweaters and jeans on their heads. Every day the sisters head out into their community, stopping at porches, kitchens and laundry areas. “We can make enough to buy more used clothes and a bag of rice with other provisions,” says Kamara. “We have to because we need to survive.”</p> <p>Samuel Koroma, a father of three, is a local photographer. The bulk of his income, less than £4 a day, derives from providing passport pictures – necessary for almost everything, including opening bank accounts and submitting job applications. “These days,” says Koroma, “there’s no business on the street. So I’m trying to get contracts to photograph for the UN or NGOs.” Koroma recently untethered his battered, five-year-old Canon camera to take photographs of a training session for young people held by a local NGO. “I’m trying to get into a different market because that’s where the money is these days,” he says.</p> <p>Manna, Kamara and Koroma have adapted to life under the Ebola crisis. They are part of the race and are continuing to pursue the finish line where survival is everything. The next meal, the next month’s rent, some prescription medicine, a pair of sandals, replacing a worn-out shirt or paying for public transport are pressing priorities.</p> <p>Manna is not as optimistic. But she and others are resilient, persistent and not without hope. “Only God can help us,” she says, “and when this is all over, we will be OK.”</p> <p><em>Stephen Douglas is a Canadian media development consultant and journalist based in Freetown, Sierra Leone. </em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/12/disasters-difficult-stories-today-listeners <p>Jamie Angus, the editor of <em>Today</em>, saw 300,000 or so of his weekly listeners switch off in the latest bout of audience research; and he thinks he knows why. We’re all used to Compassion Fatigue, a drear deluge of natural and human disasters producing more apathy than generosity. Now try Carnage Overload, morning after morning of Gaza, Syria, Iraq, the Ukraine. “People think ‘I can’t take this any more’ … and they turn over to Radio 2.”</p> <p>It’s an obvious, long-standing human condition. Too much unrelenting bad news, too many horrors we seem impotent to address – prompting withdrawal, not engagement. Newspaper editors know the problem of old. Lead, day after day, on Northern Ireland through the worst of the Troubles and you could, absolutely predictably, watch 10,000 or so readers give that paper a miss. What was the most important story of the morning then? Terrorist murders or abortive peace talks. And now? Ebola, Kobani, profound gloom. Enter Huw Edwards in full misery mode.</p> <p>You’re supposed to need to know what’s going on, to understand how bloody awful things can happen. Editors aren’t there to drop blankets of bland reassurance. But what if you don’t want to know, if you shrug, frown and walk on by?</p> <p>“We’ve got to think about how we do our storytelling, how we do the interviews,” says Angus. It’s both a sensible and a revealing answer: something less than signing up for the <em>Washington Post’s </em>new custom-built blog service, The Optimist; something more than grumping on regardless. And something, too, that at least bows half a knee to the new imperatives of the digital world.</p> <p>Mathew Ingram, lead analyst at Gigaom, defined one essential difference the other day when he talked about the success of news sites such as Quartz and Gawker. “Journalists often seem to believe that their job is to tell the reader what they think is important or relevant, rather than thinking of journalism as a service they are providing – one in which the reader’s needs or desires are paramount, rather than the journalistic instincts of the author. Approaching news as a service or, even worse, as a product, is somehow beneath them.”Which is one terse way of explaining prevailing digital theory, full of individual empowerment and iteration. You are the master now. Journalists and readers were created equal. No one knows best. But come back to Carnage Central for a moment. Is Angus (or any serious editor for that matter) right to think that we need to register the grisly threat of Ebola or the grotesque savagery of the caliphate? That we need to know – or at least be given a rigorous opportunity to find out? That, therefore, someone has to try to steer and shape our concerns?</p> <p>He’s certainly correct to want to find better ways of telling a compelling story. Stock Q&amp;A won’t do the job. There has to be measured insistence on what matters as well. Of course journalists often get things wrong. Of course readers and listeners can blot them out if they wish – or devise an alternative version. But disasters, man-made or natural, are part of our world. They’re a challenge to us, a challenge to get involved.</p> <p>It’s facile to look at the latest radio ratings and take fright, just as it’s foolish to see <em>Panorama </em>audiences slip on BBC1 and decide that too many investigations, by their nature, concentrate on complex detail, which turns viewers away. Goodbye to too much digging; hello to more “analysis”, which explains rather than reveals. But the news isn’t some giant smorgasbord you can graze at your leisure.</p> <p>All part of the service? Yes: and something rather more than that. For this service includes the sometimes sentient shedding of viewers, listeners and readers because what’s been said, what needs highlighting, has to be out there, come what may. You may not want to too much carnage before breakfast. But that’s your decision: and editors, top down, give you the tools to make it.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/11/bintu-sannoh-ebola-sierra-leone-eyewitness <p>Ebola is not a pleasing name to me. In fact, I hate even to hear the word – it has destroyed my family and education. Life was hard but OK: I live with my aunt and many family members in a big compound; we have always been poor but there was happiness. But now we are terrified. Too many people, friends and families, have died and are still dying. And the number of orphans increases on a daily basis.</p> <p>When Ebola first arrived in my country, we weren’t too worried. Then came “sensitisation” – all the community groups and NGOs running around talking about Ebola. But many refused to believe in the danger and even tried to make politics out of it. We had a riot in Kenema, under the banner of “Ebola is not real”. Some said the government does not care about Ebola because the government is from the north and the virus is in the east (home of the opposition party). Others said it was because doctors wanted your blood. There were so many stories and no one took Ebola too seriously.</p> <p>Then, in early August, the situation changed. The government banned all movements in and out of Kenema and Kailahun districts. This hurt everyone, not just those with Ebola, as almost everything came to a standstill. We were trapped – and still are. My aunt, who used to go to the trade fair to buy local goods at low prices, could no longer travel. We had less money at home – like everyone apart from the rich people who Aunty said made money because of high prices.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="5d90677c8e058dd3be2d7812e350fce93d6cf239"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/12/1413068408800/70173da3-be15-4e6b-bd7f-11852f50e954-460x276.jpeg" alt="A woman suspected of suffering from the Ebola virus sits in an ambulance in Kenema in Sierra Leone." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">A woman suspected of suffering from the Ebola virus sits in an ambulance in Kenema in Sierra Leone.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Tanya Bindra/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Things got much worse still when Ebola came into our community. There was a pharmacist who got ill but said he was suffering from a septic ulcer, so he never went to the hospital. We believed him because he was a medical man and maybe because we didn’t know any better. Many people came in contact with him during his illness. When he died, his corpse was washed and prepared for burial by people in the community, as is our custom.</p> <p>But when his death was reported to the hospital, it was found that he<strong> </strong>had died of<strong> </strong>Ebola. After about two weeks, several people who had come in contact with him and those who washed his corpse fell ill. Out of fear, the chief called for the ambulance that came and took three people to the hospital. The sound of the ambulance frightened us, especially us children, and panic gripped the entire community: people believe that whoever is taken into the ambulance to the hospital will die – you so often don’t see them again.</p> <p>Then 16 more people, including dear Aunty, became ill and, when tested, were confirmed Ebola positive. Out of that number, only Marie, a 14-year-old girl who lives with us, and my aunt mercifully survived – or else I too would be an Ebola orphan. I guess I am the lucky one, but it is hard to see it like that.</p> <p>In less than two weeks, 17 people died from five households, with nine more admitted to hospital. Next we saw a group of fearfully dressed men from the hospital. They entered our home and brought out the mattresses and bedding and set them all on fire, spraying inside all the bedrooms and parlour. I watched with tears in my eyes as they did the same thing in every house where someone had died or contracted the virus. That sight was very terrifying and we all wept.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="71901cec1b9015e8417b53e83f3745c3db076ffe"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/12/1413068473523/6b71e4e5-f80a-4250-8317-3da0b4edfcde-460x276.jpeg" alt="Healthcare workers load a man suspected of suffering from the Ebola virus onto an ambulance in Kenema, Sierra Leone." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Healthcare workers load a man suspected of suffering from the Ebola virus onto an ambulance in Kenema, Sierra Leone.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Tanya Bindra/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our community was quarantined from the rest of town and we were told that no one could leave or enter for 21 days. We were surrounded by police and military: it was scary as no one could buy or sell from within the “isolation”, nor could any business people come in to sell. People who attempted to sneak out, in need of food, were forced by the guards to return.</p> <p>Even though my aunt had been discharged from the hospital, she was too weak to go in search for food or prepare any for the family so we really suffered from hunger. No one brought us food or water for the first two weeks of isolation. In the third week, a charity group brought bulgur, oil and beans.</p> <p>We refused to eat the bulgur though, because it gives you a runny tummy; and if you have a runny tummy and are in an isolation zone they will definitely say you have Ebola and may take you away. So we bought gari (granular flour) throughout the three weeks because that was all my poor aunt could afford – it costs just 500Le (15 pence) for a cup that can feed three people for a meal.</p> <p>Even now, with all this, there is a problem with educating people about Ebola. I just met two of my friends who told me about the illness of their uncle and how they were taking care of him at home, which they should not be doing as their uncle might have the Ebola virus.</p> <p>Over 100 children have been orphaned in my community alone. Who is going to take care of them? How will they survive or even go back to school? Fear always grips me when friends who I know don’t regularly wash their hands with chlorinated water want to play with me.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="754085f7e3689fac2618d88a4b121c7c8c51af26"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/12/1413068554831/747b74db-38fe-4ce1-ad8a-363301c2c87c-460x276.jpeg" alt="A healthcare worker sprays disinfectant in the area they found a man suspected of suffering from the Ebola virus in Kenema, Sierra Leone." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">A healthcare worker sprays disinfectant in the area they found a man suspected of suffering from the Ebola virus in Kenema, Sierra Leone.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Tanya Bindra/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thinking a little towards the future, how do I go back to school? Where will my aunt get money to support our education again? It is hard to depend on others. We want to depend on our own like we were learning to. Because of my aunt’s weakness and the difficulty of trading we have eaten the money there was in the business. We are suffering. If Ebola does not kill us, maybe hardship and hunger will get us down if no one helps us before Christmas.</p> <p>Three of my friends who were to sit the BECCE (GCSE equivalent) exams have been impregnated already and I am also under pressure to go after men in order to survive and to buy a dress for Christmas. This is what girls have to do in Sierra Leone when there is no money. It is not right, but it is normal. If this Ebola does not end soon, many more girls will get pregnant before schools reopen and that will be too bad for the future of children in this country.</p> <p>I should be in school now but all schools are closed indefinitely. I am worried because by the time schools reopen, there will be too many dropouts due to poverty and teenage pregnancy.</p> <p>Of course, those who get Ebola and their families suffer the worst. They are provoked and the stigma keeps them worried and isolated without help. They have no food to eat and even the properties that are burned down are not replaced. But <em>everybody</em> in Sierra Leone is suffering because of all the other things. There is no business, no money, no food, no schools. Who will help us out of this trouble?</p> <p><em>Ebola crisis appeal: <a href="http://www.street-child.co.uk">www.street-child.co.uk</a></em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/11/ebola-checks-uk-airports-waste-of-time <p>The first Ebola cases will soon emerge in the UK according to the government’s chief medical officer, who said the country should expect “a handful” of people to fall ill with the disease in coming months.</p> <p>Dame Sally Davies issued her warning on Saturday following a national exercise to test Britain’s readiness for an Ebola outbreak amid growing criticism that government priorities for dealing with the threat are seriously misplaced.</p> <p>Davies said: “It will not be surprising if we have spillover into this country so I would expect a handful of cases in the next few months. This vitally important exercise gave a very realistic test of how prepared the system is to deal with a case of Ebola. Today has included a variety of scenarios involving personnel from hospitals, ambulance services and local authorities around the country.”</p> <p>Despite the predicted spread, Dr David Nabarro, the UN’s senior system coordinator for Ebola, told the BBC’s <em>Up All Night</em> on Sunday morning that he believed the disease would be “under control” in three months.</p> <p>While the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, announced – after chairing a simulated meeting of the emergency Cobra committee as part of the UK’s test – that the exercise had been reassuring and “extremely useful”, other politicians and scientists described government plans as futile. The eight-hour exercise involved actors simulating symptoms of Ebola with one person “collapsing” in a Gateshead shopping centre and being placed in isolation at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne, and was held as a preamble to the introduction of screening for the virus at large airports and terminals. But many experts have voiced serious misgivings about the introduction of screening, ordered by David Cameron as part of the UK’s contingency plan against Ebola, which has killed more than 4,000 people in west Africa.</p> <p>Professor David Mabey, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said screening would be futile. “There won’t be anyone coming from these [west African] countries because all direct flights have been cancelled,” he said. “Are they going to screen everyone from Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam? That would lead to a lot of delays and disruption.”</p> <p>This point was supported by virologist Dr Ben Neuman of Reading University, who said there was no “strong scientific case that airport screening will help keep Ebola out of the UK”. Professor Tom Solomon, Liverpool University’s head of infection and global health, said evidence “suggests such measures won’t make a large difference”.</p> <p>An even more trenchant criticism of the government’s emphasis on spotting Ebola victims as they entered Britain was provided from Sierra Leone by Andrew Gleadle, programme director for the International Medical Corps. “I’d like to see is a little less hysteria in the US and the UK,” he said. “We may get a few isolated cases [in the west] but we’re not going to get an epidemic. We need more focus on west Africa, where the real problem is.”</p> <p>Children’s charity Plan UK, said the only “truly effective” way of preventing Ebola reaching Britain was to tackle the crisis in west Africa. “As the government introduces more measures to try to prevent the arrival of Ebola in this country, it would be fatal to forget that the best way to help the UK is to help west Africa,” said chief executive Tanya Barron. “This is an outbreak that needs tackling at source, and to change the course of the crisis, we mustn’t simply hunker down in developed nations. We must break the chain of infection.”</p> <p>Others raised doubts about the arrangements for screening at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar rail terminals. A spokesman for Gatwick said the airport had not received any instructions on how screening should be carried out. Labour MP Keith Vaz said a lack of precise information available about the screening was “shambolic”.</p> <p>The US has begun screening travellers from the three west African countries most affected by Ebola infections – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – at JFK airport in New York and was expecting to expand this to Newark Liberty, Washington Dulles, Chicago O’Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta later this week.</p> <p>It was also confirmed that more than 750 UK military personnel and the medical ship RFA Argus were being sent to west Africa to help in the efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak.</p> <p>“What we are focusing on as a country is taking action right across the board to deal with this problem at source,” the prime minister said on Saturday. “What we do is listen to the medical advice and we act on that advice, and that’s why we are introducing the screening processes at the appropriate ports and airports.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, doctors in Macedonia have ruled out the Ebola virus as the cause of death of a British man in the Balkan country on Thursday. “We have just received the results from the lab in Hamburg and they are negative for Ebola, which means that the patient did not have the Ebola virus,” said Dr Jovanka Kostovska of the Macedonian health ministry’s commission for infectious diseases.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/11/ebola-crisis-uk-readiness-virus-assessed-nationwide-exercise <p>Britain has carried out a national exercise to test the preparedness of the emergency services and the government for an Ebola outbreak.</p> <p>Actors were deployed to simulate symptoms of the deadly virus while ministers joined dozens of medical professionals from hospitals, the ambulance service and Public Health England as they played through scenarios.</p> <p>In one case, a person who “collapsed” in a Gateshead shopping centre was placed in isolation at the Royal Victoria infirmary in Newcastle after being assessed.</p> <p>Samples were sent for urgent testing at the Porton Down government science laboratories in Wiltshire and, after returning an Ebola diagnosis, the patient was transferred to the Royal Free hospital in north London.</p> <p>In a separate case, a patient who had recently returned from west Africa went to the Hillingdon walk-in centre in west London, complaining of flu-like symptoms.</p> <p>Blood tests were again sent to Porton Down and the patient was taken to the Royal Free after being diagnosed with the disease while officials began tracing the contacts of those involved.</p> <p>Health secretary Jeremy Hunt chaired a simulated meeting of the emergency Cobra committee as part of the exercise, which he said was just one part of the government’s contingency plans for Ebola.</p> <p>“This is an extremely useful exercise and I feel doubly reassured that we have robust plans in place in the event that we get an Ebola case in the UK. We will evaluate what went well and what we need to improve,” he said.</p> <p>Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, said: “This vitally important exercise gave a very realistic test of how prepared the system is to deal with a case of Ebola. Today has included a variety of scenarios involving personnel from hospitals, ambulance services and local authorities around the country.”</p> <p>Noreen Rice, Hillingdon hospital’s emergency care services manager, said that lessons had been learned from the experience.</p> <p>The exercise came after David Cameron was forced to defend the decision to introduce enhanced screening for the virus at major airports and terminals, saying it had been taken on medical advice.</p> <p>Questions have been raised about the checks, which are to take place at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and the Eurostar rail terminal. A spokesman for Gatwick said it had not been given any instructions about how the screening should be carried out.</p> <p>According to Downing Street, the screening will involve assessing passengers’ recent travel history, contacts and onward travel arrangements, as well as a possible medical assessment conducted by trained medical personnel.</p> <p>Most travellers at airports are not expected to encounter the measures as they are intended to target arrivals from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, the countries at the centre of the Ebola outbreak, which has killed more than 4,000 people since December.</p> <p>Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee, said a lack of precise information available about screening was shambolic following confusion over whether the government would introduce the measures at all.</p> <p>A No 10 spokeswoman said the decision to introduce enhanced screening for Ebola was based on advice from the chief medical officer.</p> <p>But David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has called screening a complete waste of time.</p> <p>Meanwhile, more than 750 military personnel and the medical ship RFA Argus are being sent to west Africa to help in the efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak.</p> <p>The ship, part of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, has a fully equipped hospital including critical care and high-dependency units. It arrived in Falmouth, Cornwall, on Saturday for loading before setting sail for Sierra Leone next week.</p> <p>The Argus will also carry three Merlin helicopters, aircrew and engineers to provide transport and support to medical teams and aid workers.</p> <p>Tests have ruled out Ebola as the cause of death of a British man who died in Macedonia on Thursday.</p> <p>The man had arrived in hospital a few hours earlier suffering from a fever, vomiting and internal bleeding – all symptoms of the virus.</p> <p>However, a senior health official said that man had consumed large amounts of alcohol.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/11/ebola-crisis-britain-us-measures-spread-virus <p>Britain and the United States have stepped up measures to counter the spread of Ebola as more people were isolated in Europe and Africa to monitor them for symptoms of the deadly virus.</p> <p>An eight-hour exercise was being held in various locations across Britain on Saturday to test how the country would deal with a potential outbreak of the virus, which has killed more than 4,000 people worldwide.</p> <p>Actors have been used to simulate patients with symptoms of Ebola to test the response of emergency services, government ministers and health chiefs. The Department of Health has not disclosed where the exercises are taking place.</p> <p>Meanwhile, US authorities are introducing new border checks at airports in the wake of the death of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient to be diagnosed with Ebola outside Africa. Duncan had travelled to the US from Liberia, and was only diagnosed with the disease once he arrived in Dallas.</p> <p>New York’s JFK airport is to start enhanced screening passengers from the west African countries worst affected by Ebola, and checks will begin in the next few days at another four: O’Hare in Chicago, Newark, Washington’s Dulles and Atlanta’s airport.</p> <p>The move comes amid criticism of the failure to admit Duncan when he first went to the hospital in Texas and told staff of his recent arrival from Liberia, delaying his treatment by at least two crucial days and potentially exposing others to the virus. It took almost a week to clean the apartment where he stayed and health officials briefly lost track of a homeless man whom they were monitoring for Ebola symptoms.</p> <p>But Dr Michael Osterholm, an expert on infectious disease at the University of Minnesota, warned there was yet no detailed national plan or protocol for Ebola. “Some states are much, much better prepared from a public health perspective to handle [an outbreak] than others,” he said.</p> <p>The UK government said on Friday that passengers arriving at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and the Eurostar rail terminal would also face screening, but the effectiveness of the move has been questioned by health experts.</p> <p>Meanwhile, three more people are being monitored in a Madrid hospital for signs of Ebola, bringing to total number of those under observation in Spain to 16.</p> <p>Teresa Romero, a nurse who contracted the virus after caring for two infected priests repatriated to Spain, remains seriously ill in hospital. She is so far the only person who has tested positive for Ebola through a transmission in Spain. But the case has raised concerns about contagion in Europe, and particularly Spain’s emergency planning to contain the spread of the often fatal virus.</p> <p>Romero’s condition remains serious but improved overnight, a hospital source said on Saturday: “She is conscious and talks from time to time when she is in a good mood.”</p> <p>Three more people who came into contact with Romero – a hairdresser, another nurse and a cleaner – were admitted to the isolation unit at the Carlos III hospital on Friday night. None of the 16 now being monitored, including Romero’s husband, have shown Ebola symptoms.</p> <p>The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Liberia said that 41 staff members, including 20 military personnel, were under “close medical observation” after an international member of its medical team contracted Ebola. The measures were described as precautionary as none of the staff members had shown signs of the virus.</p> <p>Liberia has recorded 2,316 confirmed, suspected and probable Ebola deaths - by far the highest of any country affected by the current outbreak, according to the latest World Health Organisation figures released on Friday.</p> <p>Brazil’s health ministry said on Saturday that a man under observation for signs of the virus tested negative for the disease.</p> <p>The 47-year-old man arrived in Brazil on 19 September from Guinea. The health ministry said he remained in quarantine in Rio de Janeiro and would only receive a clean bill of health following a second exam scheduled to take place on Sunday.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/11/australia-says-too-risky-to-send-health-workers-ebola <p>Australia will not send health workers to Ebola outbreak zones until their welfare can be guaranteed.<br /></p> <p>Despite talks with European nations, the UK and the US, Australia has been unable to shore up a treatment or evacuation plan for its personnel should they be sent to west Africa, the minister for foreign affairs, Julie Bishop, says.<br /></p> <p>“I do not have in place a guarantee that should an Australian health worker – sent there by the Australian government – contract Ebola, they would be able to be transported or treated in a hospital either in the region or in Europe,” she told reporters in Launceston on Saturday.<br /></p> <p>“And until I have that in place we will not be sending Australian health workers.”<br /></p> <p>The minister presumed Australian health workers travelling privately to the outbreak region would be covered by a credible plan provided by their affiliate organisation.<br /></p> <p>The Australian government has contributed $18m for equipment and supplies in west Africa since the Ebola outbreak.<br /></p> <p>Bishop’s comments follow an Ebola scare in Queensland where Cairns nurse Sue Ellen Kovack, 57, returned from working in Sierra Leone, with symptoms including a fever.<br /></p> <p>Initial tests cleared Kovack of Ebola but she remains in isolation in hospital and will have a second round of tests on Sunday.<br /></p> <p>She was tested for the virus on Thursday after developing a low-grade fever upon her return to Australia after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. She was held in isolation at Cairns hospital and her blood samples were flown to Brisbane for testing.<br /></p> <p>Queensland’s chief health officer, Jeannette Young, confirmed on Friday morning that the initial tests had returned a negative result. Kovack will continue to be held in hospital for at least 24 hours. She will be tested again at the weekend.</p> <p>“This is a necessary precaution given the patient has been to west Africa and has had a fever within the incubation period of 21 days,” Young said. “For the sake of her health and to follow due diligence, we want to be sure she is clear of Ebola virus disease as well as any other disease.”</p> <p>Young said even if Kovack had tested positive for Ebola the wider community had not been at risk. Kovack had been held in home isolation since her return from Sierra Leone on Tuesday and had not developed the symptoms of Ebola which make it contagious, such as vomiting and diarrhoea.</p> <p>Health minister Peter Dutton said 11 people across Australia had been tested for Ebola and all had returned negative results as he warned against community panic.</p> <p>“I want people to put things in perspective here, it’s not spread by people coughing … the chances of it being spread here are next to nil. We have the ability to deal with people and rapidly test,” he told reporters in Melbourne.<br /></p> <p>Dutton said he was “very satisfied” with the advice the government had received from Young, other health officials and immigration officials about how to best handle people coming back to Australia from Ebola-affected countries.<br /></p> <p>He dismissed independent MP Bob Katter’s comments that Australians should be held in official isolation for three weeks and humanitarian workers were putting all of Australia at risk.<br /></p> <p>“I’m happy for Mr Katter to be briefed and informed on these matters before he makes any further public comment so he’s properly informed about Ebola and [the] risk that it poses,” he said.<br /></p> <p>He said Kovack’s initial negative result was a “huge relief” for her, as well as the government.<br /></p> <p>Queensland will now hold health workers returning from west Africa in Brisbane, rather than their own homes in other parts of the state, so treatment can be swift if they are diagnosed with the virus, the state’s health minister Lawrence Springborg said.<br /></p> <p>“In the case of this nurse, she has been extremely responsible and followed all precautionary guidelines since she has returned from treating sick people in Africa,” he said.</p> <p>“We’re encouraged this … first test of this nurse has shown this is a negative result [but] there is an incubation period that goes for up to 21 days.”</p> <p>Young also dismissed Katter’s concerns, defending Australian health workers who have gone to west Africa to treat people with the virus.</p> <p>“I have every confidence that her and other people like her who have gone over to west Africa to give of their skills, which I admire tremendously, to do what they’ve done will not put any Australian at harm. They are genuine, true, fantastic health professionals who are practising their profession so I’m not concerned by it,” she said.</p> <p>The head of the Australian Red Cross international program, Peter Walton, said Kovack had an “anxious wait” on Friday morning but was in good spirits while in isolation at Cairns hospital. He said she was aware of the intense media speculation and the discussion her case had caused in the wider community, including questions about whether Australian aid workers should be travelling to west Africa.<br /></p> <p>“If we don’t make a contribution, the risk of this expanding and becoming much more than a regional concern is absolutely going to be the case,” he told ABC News 24. “So we should be doing more. And I think Australian aid workers like Sue Ellen are incredibly brave being at the frontline.”</p> <p>Walton said Kovack was a clinical nurse who had worked in a Red Cross Ebola treatment centre about 180km from Freetown.</p> <p>The Australian government has resisted calls to send health professionals to west Africa to help with the epidemic.</p> <p>“The worst-case scenarios are that it’s going to be keep doubling every three weeks [and] there will be over 1.4m people affected,” Walton said. “That is the worst-case scenario but more needs to be done. We certainly hope that won’t be the case.”</p> <p>Queensland’s premier, Campbell Newman, cautiously welcomed the news of Kovack’s initial negative result. “Let’s keep our fingers crossed for the patient involved,” he told reporters in Canberra, where he has travelled for a Council of Australian Governments meeting.</p> <p>Almost 4,000 people have died from Ebola in west Africa and Kovack was one of several Australians who have travelled to the region to help treat patients there.</p> <p>A doctor is in home isolation in south Brisbane after returning from treating Ebola patients overseas.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/10/madrid-hospital-staff-quit-ebola <p>Concerns about a lack of training and safety standards have left some staff refusing to attend to possible Ebola cases at Madrid’s Carlos III hospital, where the first known person to contract the disease outside west Africa is being treated.</p> <p>Fourteen people are in quarantine at the hospital, including four health workers who treated <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/ebola-outbreak-six-quarantined-in-spain-madrid-hospital-ramos" title="">Teresa Romero Ramos</a>, the Spanish nurse who contracted the virus after treating an Ebola patient repatriated from Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Seven people, including two hairdressers who had given Romero a beauty treatment before she was diagnosed, entered the isolation unit on Thursday. None has tested positive for the disease except Romero, whose condition was described by the hospital as serious but stable. Her treatment has included injections with antibodies extracted from the blood of Ebola survivors.</p> <p>Making a surprise visit to the hospital on Friday, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, did not comment on allegations of substandard practices, but said a special commission had been set up to discuss measures to stop the disease spreading.</p> <p>At the end of Rajoy’s visit health workers gathered around his convoy, jeered and threw surgical gloves in protest at the government’s handling of Romero’s case.</p> <p>While no official numbers were available, Elvira González of the SAE nurses’ union said fear of Ebola had caused some staff to refuse to treat certain patients, while others had resigned.</p> <p>One health worker told the newspaper El País that many staff members were making excuses to avoid work. “They are saying they’ve got their period, that they’re getting dizzy, that they’re claustrophobic … people get anxious and they can’t work like that, being so nervous.”</p> <p>Others worry about being stigmatised. “Their children aren’t being invited to birthday parties and their friends are cancelling joint holiday plans,” Juan José Cano, a member of the Satse nursing union, told El País. “They’ve become known as the Ebola nurses. And it’s not fair.”</p> <p>The hospital was not forcing staff to work, González said. “There are questions as to whether the protective suits are adequate, if the protocols are adequate. A health professional could accuse the administration of a public health offence if they are forced to work in conditions that are not adequate.”</p> <p>The staff shortage has forced the hospital to seek help from unemployed health workers. One recent nursing graduate told El País she had delivered a CV to La Paz hospital in Madrid on Wednesday morning.</p> <p>Hours later, she received a call offering her work at the Carlos III hospital the next day. Initially, “they didn’t say one word about Ebola”, the 25-year-old said. After discussing the job opportunity with her family, she turned down the work.</p> <p>Health authorities have done little to dispel claims by health workers that the response to Ebola in Madrid has been improvised. In August, when the first missionary with the virus was repatriated from Liberia, the Carlos III hospital was emptied to attend tofor him. When the second missionary arrived last month, it was decided that only the sixth floor would be cleared. Between appointments and surgeries, the hospital continued as normal.</p> <p>Initially, the same was done after Romero Ramos tested positive on Monday. But as the number of patients in quarantine grows, authorities have been forced to hastily find more space.</p> <p>In recent days, two more floors have been cleared, with patients either discharged or transferred to other hospitals in the city.</p> <p>The Ebola outbreak has claimed almost 4,000 lives in west Africa since the first cases were recorded in Guinea in December last year, and has been described as the biggest global health threat since Aids. The virus causes fever, diarrhoea and vomiting, and sometimes internal bleeding, and spreads through direct contact with body fluids.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/10/thomas-duncan-ebola-medical-records-high-fever <p>Thomas Duncan, the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan">first person to die of Ebola in the US</a>, was released from hospital with a 103F fever on his first visit, despite telling a nurse he had recently travelled from Africa and exhibiting key symptoms of the deadly virus, it was revealed on Friday.</p> <p> Duncan, a Liberian national, was sent home from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital even though his fever spiked on his first visit to the emergency room on 26 September, according to his medical records obtained by the Associated Press. A “physician’s note” from the visit says Duncan was “negative for fever and chills” despite having a 103F (39.4C) temperature.</p> <p>The family provided the AP with more than 1,400 pages of Duncan’s medical records, which apparently chronicle the events that ultimately culminated in his death at 7.51am on Wednesday. </p> <p>Duncan arrived in Dallas from Liberia on 20 September to be reunited with Louise Troh, the mother of his child, whom he intended to marry. A few days later, Duncan fell ill. He went to the hospital complaining of abdominal pain, dizziness, a headache and decreased urination, according to the AP. The records show that Duncan reported his level of pain was eight on a scale of 10. Doctors ran a series of tests, ruling out appendicitis and a stroke, among other ailments.</p> <p>When the examination was over, the doctors prescribed him antibiotics and told him to take Tylenol, an over-the-counter drug designed to relieve pain and fever. Duncan returned home to the apartment he was sharing with Troh and her relatives. </p> <p>Four days after he first began feeling sick, his condition worsened and he was rushed to the hospital by ambulance, where he was admitted and quickly placed in isolation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed last Tuesday that Duncan had tested positive for Ebola. </p> <p>Over the weekend, Duncan’s kidney function declined, he was placed on dialysis and was breathing through a respirator. The hospital began treating Duncan with the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/06/nbc-photojournalist-diagnosed-ebola-nebraska">experimental antiviral drug</a> brincidofovir. On Wednesday, Duncan died.<br /></p> <p>It is still not clear why the hospital did not test Duncan for Ebola on his first visit, based on his travel history and symptoms. The hospital initially said Duncan had not told them of his travel history, and then later said he had, but the nurse had not shared that information with the entire medical team. The following day, the hospital changed its story again, attributing the error to a “flaw” in its online health records system, but then corrected its statement and said their was “no flaw” and Duncan’s travel history had been available to the entire medical team.<br /></p> <p>Many in the community are raising questions about the standard of care Duncan received, and some <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/ebola-scare-race-frisco-dallas-texas-monnig-duncan">believe his race and lack of insurance</a> played a role in the hospital’s decision to send Duncan home, feverishly ill with a course of antibiotics. </p> <p>Duncan’s nephew, Josephus Weeks, issued a statement on Thursday in which he alleged that his uncle may have been given inadequate treatment because of his skin colour: “Eric Duncan was treated unfairly. Eric walked into the hospital, the other patients were carried in after an 18-hour flight. It is suspicious to us that all the white patients survived and this one black patient passed away. It took eight days to get him medicine. He didn’t begin treatment in Africa, he began treatment here, but he wasn’t given a chance.”</p> <p>The hospital responded to similar claims in a statement it released on Thursday, saying that it has “a long history of treating a multicultural community” and provided Duncan with “the same level of attention and care that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care.”</p> <p>Mark Wingfield, associate pastor at the church attended by Louise Troh, Duncan’s partner, said that Troh, her teenaged son and two nephews are still in quarantine and not showing any symptoms. They are expected to remain isolated until 19 October when the maximum 21-day incubation period is over.</p> <p>Wingfield said that the family has not yet decided whether to sue the hospital. “That’s still an underlying current. I don’t know that Louise has come to any resolution on that,” he said.</p> <p>As well as the obstacle to any potentially successful legal action posed by the virus’s high mortality rate, Texas governor Rick Perry in 2003 signed into law one of the nation’s toughest statutes to limit liability for medical malpractice. The law caps “non-economic” damages payable by individuals and hospitals – such as payouts for suffering and mental trauma – to $250,000 per claimant.</p> <p>None of the 48 people under observation in the Dallas area who may have had contact with Duncan are showing symptoms of the virus, David Lakey, the Texas health commissioner, told a congressional homeland security committee hearing on Ebola response coordination held at Dallas-Fort Worth international airport on Friday afternoon.</p> <p>It is the 12th day of monitoring via daily contact with an epidemiologist and twice-daily temperature checks; the most common period for Ebola symptoms to reveal themselves, according to the CDC, is eight to 10 days after exposure.</p> <p>“We remain confident that Ebola is not a significant public health threat to the United States,” Toby Merlin, director of the CDC’s division of preparedness and emerging infection, told the hearing. He reiterated the agency’s stance that restricting air travel between the US and the affected region in Africa would be a harmful step because it would hamper efforts to combat Ebola and worsen the economic situation there.</p> <p>Dallas County judge Clay Jenkins, who has been criticised for driving the quarantined family from their north Dallas apartment to a temporary home in an undisclosed location without wearing protective clothes, defended his decision at the hearing.</p> <p>Jenkins said it was “important that I not move that family wearing a Hazmat suit. It’s important for them to see me as a fellow human being, face to face, and for me to converse with them as equals. That is a basic tenet of leadership and it is in keeping with modern medicine. Louise Troh and those three young men have been handling an extraordinary scary, sad and difficult situation with grace.”</p> <p>Still, a professional hazardous materials cleaning company decontaminated and stripped out the apartment last Saturday, removing the contents in 140 55-gallon drums and disposing of them.</p> <p>Asked by the Guardian if he expected the family to take legal action, Jenkins said: “The family is grieving, they’re hurting like any family would be in any death and those sort of things will be determined at some time later but it’s only normal in the grieving process for people to ask, ‘what if?’ and ‘why?’ and that doesn’t make them any less deserving of our prayers and sympathies and they have every right to ask ‘what if?’ and ‘why?”</p> <p>Jenkins said he spoke to Duncan’s son, Kasiah, on Thursdayight. “He’s a 19-year-old young man who can’t go back to college right now, who can’t hug his mother and his father died, so he’s in a tough place but he’s doing as well as can be expected,” he said.</p> <p>The New York Times reported thaton Thursdaynearly 100 children were absent from the elementary school in Dallas’ affluent Highland Park district where Jenkins’ eight-year-old daughter is a pupil and his wife volunteers at lunchtimes, ompared with the usual number of about a dozen.</p> <p>“I tend to focus on the several hundred who follow science and stay calm and carry on as opposed to the people who understandably love their children and have this concern, but we’ve gone to extraordinary lengths to reassure people – the top Ebola response doctors, the CDC, Dr Lakey and the entire Dallas County medical society leadership have signed letters saying there is zero risk of me having contracted Ebola and therefore zero risk of that eight-year-old girl having Ebola,” said Jenkins.</p> <p>Dallas education officials said last week that five children who may have come into contact with Duncan are being kept out of their schools during the 21-day incubation period. Jenkins said that he and Dallas school district superintendent Mike Miles would be talking to principals and forming a plan to make sure the affected children are not bullied, teased or otherwise shunned when they return to classes. “We’ll see to it that those children are treated with the dignity that every child deserves,” he said.<br /><br />The game between the universities of Texas and Oklahoma, which will take place on the State Fair grounds, is a 92,500 sell-out. Karissa Schuler, spokeswoman for the fair, said that organisers have not noticed a decline in attendance since the Ebola scare started. “Since the news broke we have definitely made hand sanitiser even more available,” she said, adding that more signage promoting handwashing and cleanliness has been put up. </p> <p>Schuler said that several times an hour, Big Tex, a 55-foot-tall talking mechanical cowboy who is the centrepiece of the fairground, is broadcasting messages to attendees advising them to “wash your hands before you eat”.</p> <p>Merlin, of the CDC, said that dramatic images such as <a href="http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Frisco-Investigating-Possible-Ebola-Case-278555081.html">footage of</a> a Dallas-area sheriff’s deputy being taken to hospital by officials wearing full protecting clothing were helping inflame public fears that were unwarranted, he said, given the limited ways in which the virus can be transmitted.</p> <p>“I wince every time I see the TV images with people in space suits because it gives an impression about the infectivity of the virus that is not realistic, it is an overreaction,” he said.</p> <p>This weekend is set to see an unusually large influx of visitors to Dallas, as there is a high-profile college American football game at the Cotton Bowl on Saturday and the annual state fair is ongoing.</p> <p>Frank Librio, spokesman for the Dallas convention and visitors bureau, said that since the news broke they had only received two requests for information from organisations scheduled to visit Dallas. “The groups were not concerned or cancelling their meetings, an indication that people are paying attention to the medical facts. We have not received any calls from tourists to my knowledge,” he said.</p> <p>As questions linger over Duncan’s death in the US, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a grim milestone in the current Ebola outbreak – the disease has claimed more than 4,000 lives since the outbreak began in March 2014.</p> <p>The WHO report noted that the exposure of health care workers to the virus is an “alarming feature of this outbreak”. More than 400 health care workers have developed Ebola since the outbreak began, including three American medical missionaries who contracted the virus while working at a hospital in Liberia and an American doctor with the WHO who contracted it in Sierra Leone and is still being treated in an Atlanta hospital. <br /></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/10/ebola-awareness-posters-uk-airports-screening <p>Posters aimed at raising awareness of Ebola are to be put up at larger British airports, according to internal advice sent out to all UK Border Force staff following the government’s U-turn on screening for the disease on entry to the country .</p> <p>With just over a week to go before the first direct flight to the UK from West Africa for two months, the posters referred to in the Border Force memo – which the Guardian has seen – were among the few concrete details to emerge about the government’s strategy, amid claims from some experts that screening is a waste of time.</p> <p>A message marked “sensitive” sent out to staff by Marc Owen, the Border Force’s acting chief operating officer, said that the large outbreak of Ebola in west Africa was “understandably” causing staff some concern regarding the risk from infected passengers, but reassured them that the threat as currently assessed by health authorities was “very low”.</p> <p>He said the government planned to put up awareness posters at larger UK airports and ports to raise awareness of the disease among passengers arriving into the UK. The posters will advise them what symptoms they should look out for and what to do should they develop these symptoms.</p> <p>The message was accompanied by a Q&amp;A, with questions such as “What should I do if someone collapses in front of me at control?” and “Should I use latex gloves?” The answers were that it was highly unlikely someone ill enough to collapse would have been travelling in the first place, and that alcohol hand gel was more effective than latex gloves.</p> <p>The prime minister yesterday defended the decision to introduce enhanced screening for Ebola at Heathrow and Gatwick, and at Eurostar terminals. “What we do is listen to the medical advice and we act on that advice, and that’s why we are introducing the screening processes at the appropriate ports and airports,” David Cameron said. According to Downing Street, which was yet to issue further details last night, the screening will involve assessing passengers’ recent travel history, contacts and onward travel arrangements, as well as a possible medical assessment conducted by trained medical personnel.</p> <p>Most travellers at airports are not expected to encounter the measures as they are intended to target arrivals from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, the countries at the centre of the Ebola outbreak, which has killed more than 4,000 people since December.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Labour MP Keith Vaz said a lack of precise information available about screening was “shambolic” following confusion over whether the government would introduce the measures at all.</p> <p>David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, called the screening a “complete waste of time”. “Are they going to screen everyone from Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam? That would lead to a lot of delays and disruption. Secondly, why would anyone admit that they have been in contact with someone when they’re in a hurry to get through immigration control when they arrive at the airport?”</p> <p>There was also criticism from the World Health Organisation’s director of strategy, Chris Dye, who said it was unlikely the scheme would detect anyone with Ebola. “The chances of someone with Ebola turning up in the UK is relatively small,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.</p> <p>Professor George Griffin, chair of the government’s advisory committee on dangerous pathogens, described the planned tests as “a very, very blunt instrument” and added that he was surprised that screening was being introduced after being led to believe it would not be.</p> <p>Staff working at airports are meanwhile divided about the plans. While the Immigration Services Union, which representing 5,000 border staff, has been sharply critical of the announcement, others have been quietly supportive of the government’s plans.</p> <p>Sian Griffiths, former president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, said screening was “not the solution but it’s is part of the panoply of tools you need to work with”. She worked on the Sars outbreak in Asia more than 10 years ago and said effective screening would raise general awareness about infectious diseases. In 2002 and 2003 all airlines in the Sars-affected countries issued forms to airlines obliging passengers to say who they had been in touch with in the event of a positive test post arrival.</p> <p>Passengers were also required to walk through heat sensitive camera gates which checked temperatures. “It involved millions of passengers. Everybody was screened. Even if you crossed the bridge from Hong Kong to China you have to fill in a form. It is a big effort, but people’s reaction to infectious disease is all about judgment and risk, “ she said, recalling how Asians are now more naturally open to precautions such as constant washing of hands as a result of Sars.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/10/ebola-bushmeat-risk-europe-food-safety-expert-assessment <p>European food safety experts have been asked to assess the risk of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola" title="">Ebola</a> being spread in EU member states through eating contaminated bushmeat.</p> <p>The assessment is expected by the end of the month. In April, scientists said the risks were very low but also admitted high uncertainty about their estimate.</p> <p>There is extremely little data about just how much bushmeat, often from primates but also other wildlife hunted in Africa, is illegally imported into the EU or how it is treated, handled and cooked.</p> <p>UK Border Force figures show low amounts are seized entering the UK – about 450kg estimated in 2013-14, and 300kg the year before. In 2006-7, nearly 3,400kg was seized.</p> <p>There have been persistent claims, however, that some bushmeat evades controls while <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10341174" title="">researchers sugested in 2010 that 270 tonnes of illegal bushmeat reached Paris Charles de Gaulle airport each year.</a></p> <p>The European commission first asked for an opinion in April when the crisis had not spread beyond western Africa but now wants an update amid mounting international concern about the spread of the virus.</p> <p>In an email to the Guardian on Friday, the commission’s directorate reponsible for health said it had asked the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa) for assistance in providing an update on the risk of transmission of Ebola via the food chain.</p> <p>Efsa later said: “Ebola is thought to circulate in wild animals in sub-Saharan Africa. It has been found in fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas and duikers [a type of antelope]. Import into the EU of any fresh meat from western African countries is not authorised. Efsa’s scientists are working to complete their assessment by the end of the month.”</p> <p>An earlier assessment by Efsa and the <a href="http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/Pages/home.aspx" title="">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)</a> said the virus could be inactivated by ultraviolet radiation, irradiation, or heating for an hour at 60C (140F). There was no evidence regarding smoked meat but freezing or refrigeration would not inactivate the virus. Contact with raw meat from an animal with Ebola could lead to those handling contracting the virus.</p> <p>Their assessment said: “Given the estimated low probabilities for the steps required to expose European countries to contaminated bushmeat, it is expected the overall risk from consumers to acquire [the virus] from consumption of contaminated bushmeat is very low, with high uncertainty about this estimate.”</p> <p>The assessment continued: “Skinning and chopping monkey cadavers has been identified as a source of contamination, but human infection deriving from ingestion of contaminated meat has not been documented.”</p> <p>It added that “to our knowledge there has been no reported case of meat-borne transmission of (the virus) from consumption of illegally imported bushmeat in the EU”.</p> <p>However, it advised border guards and other authorities checking for bushmeat to take suitable precautions, including wearing protective clothing.</p> <p>But the authorities said: “Illegal importation of wildlife products such as bushmeat may be a potential source of contamination by pathogens such as (the virus). The risk is considered very low for cooked, dried or smoked bushmeat. The risk is however much higher for uncooked (fresh or frozen) bushmeat as the virus can survive for several weeks.”</p> <p>Earlier this week, the ECDC advised that asymptomatic travellers who had returned to the EU from Ebola-affected regions should not give blood, tissues or organs for two months after their return.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/10/ebola-is-frightening-so-are-prejudices-outbreaks-provoke <p>Recently, having just watched the news, my sister tweeted, “I don’t mean to be alarmist or anything, but it’s basically the end of the world.”</p> <p>It’s easy to see her point, especially now, when Ebola has had an especially busy week. On Monday it made what many saw as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-europe-unavoidable-who-spain" title="">its inevitable landfall on continental Europe</a>, then on Wednesday it claimed <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-dallas-deputy-sheriff-hospital-symptoms-death" title="">its first victim on American soil</a>. It does feel a bit like we’re living the script of an apocalyptic movie, as if somewhere in the background, that big, sonorous Hollywood voiceover is saying: in a world where an incurable disease rises to pandemic proportions, everyone is waiting like sitting ducks …</p> <p>The US and Spain now have to roll up their sleeves, or perhaps roll them down with protective bee-keeping gear or space suits. Nigeria, on the other hand, is breathing a small sigh of relief. The most populous West African country has actually managed to contain the outbreak, having learned important lessons from its recent dealings with polio and cholera. No new case of Ebola has been reported in Nigeria since 31 August, and the US Centre for Disease Control has officially declared the nation Ebola-free. This is good news for Nigeria, and it is good news for me. Yesterday I sent off my application for a visa and for quite some time I have been looking forward to my first trip to West Africa – a trip I thought I might have to cancel.</p> <p>The green light notwithstanding, I still have the jitters, and so does my family. Resigned though my sister may be to the idea that it’s the end of the world (she will go out, she says, reading Marvel comics) she still calls to beg that I wriggle my way out of the invitation. She gets my father to do the same – a family intervention of sorts. So my father calls from Jamaica warning that Caribbean islands are now putting in place strict policies limiting entry to anyone who has been to West Africa in the last 28 days. He is worried that I might disqualify myself from coming home for Christmas.</p> <p>There’s nothing like a new outbreak to have countries fall back on old prejudices, fortifying their borders against diseases that will slip in nonetheless like the most cunning refugees. Just a month ago in Trinidad, a suspected Ebola victim was hauled off a plane and put into immediate quarantine. The reason for Trinidad’s suspicion? He had a Nigerian last name. He was in fact flying to the Caribbean from London and hadn’t been to West Africa in over five years. That’s the problem – the way legitimate concerns can morph so quickly into something so much uglier, a scorn not of the disease but of the potentially diseased, the kinds of people we think might be infected. Just this Thursday in south London, a complete stranger shouted at me, “Mate, do you have Ebola?”</p> <p>The Caribbean response is ironic, as the region itself is right now in the throes of one of its worst viral outbreaks – the mosquito-spread <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Additional-funds-released-to-fight-Chikungunya-outbreak" title="">chikungunya virus</a>. Chikungunya – a word so hard to fit into the mouth that the old linguistic process of folk etymology has transformed it in Jamaica to either “chicken gunman” or “chicken gonorrhoea”, things that sound decidedly more scary to catch or be shot by. It is by a similar process that the prickly plant known as cowage in England is rendered as “cow itch” in Jamaica. We seem to have a thing for pairing animals with forms of discomfort. Unfortunately, you don’t need to be able to pronounce chikungunya in order to catch it. You only need to be bitten by a mosquito.</p> <p>Chikungunya is by no means fatal, and if you have it once, you don’t need to worry that you will have it again. But the thing is brutal in its own way – laying its victims low for three days at least, and in severe case, for months. Young and old alike display all the symptoms of arthritic grannies while running high fevers.</p> <p>The Caribbean’s response to chikungunya pales in comparison to Nigeria’s effective response to Ebola. The Jamaican health minister, Dr Fenton Ferguson, has come under particular fire for his less-than-honest insistence that there were only 35 confirmed cases on the island. He was, of course, leaning heavily on that word, “confirmed”, in the way that unethical journalists lean on the word “alleged” to spread all kinds of misinformation. The <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20140928/focus/focus3.html" title="">true number of cases of chikungunya in Jamaica</a> is far higher. But the health minister was concerned about old prejudices and borders, and the Caribbean’s fragile tourist industry.</p> <p>A former colleague of mine – a biologist – was paid one of those courtesy calls from a rather high-ranking British official. She stood in line waiting dutifully for her hand to be shaken and to make the small chit-chat that accompanies such occasions. “And what do you do?” the official asked when she got to my friend, who responded that she was a malaria specialist. “Oh my!” exclaimed the official in an impressed sort of a way, and then, in a conspiratorial tone, “isn’t it just dreadful the diseases that are coming in since we’ve opened up our borders!” That seems a little unfair to me, and ahistorical to boot, given the diseases that Europe once unleashed on the rest of the world; the unfortunate allergies, for instance, that aboriginal Caribbean people had to smallpox, and to bullets. But that’s another story.</p> <p>It may not be the end of the world, but these are indeed scary times with the rise and spread of Ebola, and the sharp-shooting chicken gunman or chicken gonorrhoea, and other diseases that surely wait around the corner. But from where I stand, what’s just as scary are the old prejudices that rise and spread, and can be just as dangerous – just as fatal – as the worst disease.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/10/ebola-crisis-online-courses-alison-knowledge-gap <p>Amos Gardy is lucky. Thanks to an online course he took last month, he has educated himself about Ebola and has been busy spreading that knowledge through his community in Monrovia, Liberia.</p> <p>Gardy, who has two sons, works for an NGO and runs a youth organisation in Monrovia. He undertook his study through <a href="http://alison.com/" title="">Advance Learning Interactive Systems Online (Alison)</a>, a Massive Open Online Course (Mooc) provider that launched an Ebola learning programme in August as the outbreak raced through towns and cities across west Africa.</p> <p>“It was a very great help because I had no knowledge of Ebola,” Gardy said in a phone interview from Monrovia. “Ebola has taken so many lives in our country. I learned how Ebola travels and how you can catch it.”</p> <p>He owns a laptop and has access to the internet, which gives him an acute sense of responsibility.</p> <p>“Not everybody has the opportunity to do the course,” said Gardy. “It’s just a few who have the internet. Those of us who can, we take our responsibility and go into the communities to educate people … The chain continues so gradually people will be aware of how to avoid the virus.”</p> <p>Alison was set up in 2007 by Mike Feerick, an Irish social entrepreneur. It allows all learning, assessment, testing and verification to be accessed by anyone, anywhere for free.</p> <p>As of December 2013, it had 2.5 million learners with 200,000 new users signing up every month. About 250,000 users are in west Africa; so far, roughly 10,000 people have completed the Ebola course. Feerick is hopeful that crowdsourcing can be used to translate it into regional languages, and eventually all global languages.</p> <p>“We have a huge engagement on our platform,” he said. “It’s a crowdsourcing way to respond to a crisis like this, which I think is new to governments and health organisations. We have people lining up to translate this course.”</p> <p>Alison has already translated the programme into French with the help of the <a href="http://www.famsanet.org" title="">Federation of African Medical Students’ Associations</a>. It is hoped that an Arabic version can be produced soon.</p> <p>“It’s amazing the lack of information people have. We have been appalled,” Feerick said. He added that no major NGO had yet approached them to harness their reach and knowledge, a fact he found both frustrating and somewhat predictable.</p> <p>“We have the largest free learning platform in Africa, by a mile. Work with us. It’s almost cost-less for the likes of Alison to respond … They are dealing with the outbreak in a classic old-fashioned way that believes money is the answer. It’s not the answer. We have infrastructure now that was not there before. Ebola is containable. The response has to be information- and education-led.”</p> <p>Feerick says most users access the course through internet cafes, laptops or workplaces. The programme can also be completed using mobile phones, and Alison has provided pdfs for people to print out and use.</p> <p>For Gardy and others living on the frontline of this global health emergency, knowledge is powerful but fear remains a constant presence. It is not just the immediate worry of catching Ebola, but also concern about what the virus is doing to Liberia’s already fragile future prospects.</p> <p>“It is very worrisome. The Ebola virus has become an economic virus. There are no jobs, no investors,” he said.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/10/un-emergency-mission-chief-battle-ebola <p>Anthony Banbury is a man with an unprecedented, unenviable mission – and he knows it. The head of the first UN emergency health mission, which was created in September to fight Ebola, compares the task to fighting a raging blaze.</p> <p>“It’s like a forest fire, it keeps spreading and spreading. And when the firefighters come in, they get embers on their backs, which fly around as they try to put [the fire] out,” Banbury said in an interview in the Ghanaian capital Accra, where the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (<a href="http://www.un.org/ebolaresponse/mission.shtml" title="">Unmeer)</a> is based.</p> <p>“The biggest challenge we have is to play the role of complex crisis manager. That’s one of the things that’s been lacking so far. There has been some really good work done by national governments, UN agencies, NGOs and – increasingly – foreign military, but they are all acting in their certain area,” he added.</p> <p>Announcing the creation of Unmeer in mid-September, the <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=7999" title="">UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said</a> the unprecedented situation required “unprecedented steps to save lives and safeguard peace and security”.</p> <p>Unmeer has five priorities: stopping the outbreak, treating the infected, ensuring essential services, preserving stability and preventing further outbreaks. To achieve these daunting goals, it needs to bring together the full range of UN actors and expertise to help the national efforts of countries struggling to control the disease. It will also work with the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States, (Ecowas).</p> <p>Ban has also warned that, as Ebola patients overwhelm poorly equipped health facilities, other people are dying from endemic diseases.</p> <p>“In the three most affected countries – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – the disease is destroying health systems. More people are now dying in Liberia from treatable ailments and common medical conditions than from Ebola,” he said.</p> <p>Banbury, an American who has worked for the White House National Security Council and the US defence department, as well as with the World Food Programme, is acutely aware of this ancillary demand. He also acknowledges that the crisis is affecting people’s ability to feed themselves: “We want to make sure that even as we are working to stop Ebola, people aren’t starving on the street.”</p> <p>According to the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2014/10/08/ebola-new-world-bank-group-study-forecasts-billions-in-economic-loss-if-epidemic-lasts-longer-spreads-in-west-africa" title="">World Bank, the Ebola outbreak could cost the economies of west Africa $32.6bn (£20.1bn) by the end of 2015</a>, devastating fragile nations still recovering from decades of intertwined, resource-led wars.</p> <p>Unmeer will coordinate the arrival of protective gear, medical supplies, vehicles and generators to the region. It will also help develop existing healthcare facilities in the affected countries, including testing centres, community care facilities, treatment centres and training centres for healthcare workers.</p> <p>“The UN is uniquely positioned to help governments with the role of complex crisis manager and to do that across the region; Accra is the perfect place for us,” Banbury said.</p> <p>The UN has established a <a href="http://mptf.undp.org/factsheet/fund/EBO00" title="">$988m Ebola response multi-partner trust fund</a> to provide a common, coherent financing mechanism.</p> <p>Banbury has already visited the affected countries. He told reporters in Liberia last week that, despite “good results”, much remained to be done. He praised the work of district health officials and frontline NGO workers.</p> <p>With the scale of the crisis ever more apparent – already Ebola has claimed more than 3,800 lives – Banbury vowed Unmeer was in it for the long haul.</p> <p>“We will stay in place for 42 days – twice as long as the incubation period – after the last case, to make sure,” he said. “There is a lot of work to do. But we will not stop until Ebola is stopped.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/10/ebola-liberia-catastrophe-generation-poverty <p>The world is waking up to the shocking effects of the Ebola outbreak in west Africa. The US and the UK <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-us-troops-direct-contact-potential-sufferers-liberia" title="">have committed military forces</a>, and international organisations are similarly increasing funding and resources across the three affected countries. As cases appear in the US and Spain, it is obvious that this outbreak is no longer a localised west African problem, but a global emergency.</p> <p>If any more of a warning were needed, the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan" title="">death of a Liberian in Texas</a> on Wednesday indicates the need for a unified global response, a call that was made by the Liberian government many months ago. Many have wished Ebola away, but the reality of our interconnected world has, despite our best efforts, meant the disease is now very real in countries far from the source of the outbreak.</p> <p>At the IMF and World Bank meetings this week, Ebola is being raised to the top of the agenda. This is because this crisis has ramifications far beyond public health. In short, the tragedy of Ebola does not lie just with the thousands of grieving families across the Mano River Union. It threatens an economic catastrophe that will affect a generation.</p> <p>All three affected west African nations already had fragile economies – in Liberia, we have emerged from a brutal civil war only 11 years previously. Similarly, Sierra Leone suffered a devastating civil conflict. Before this disease took hold, Liberia’s economic recovery was in full flow. Our economy was set to grow 5.9% this year. International investment was increasing. Major infrastructure projects were in the pipeline. Now with mining operations halted, harvests missed, regional trade suffocated and investors sheltering abroad, we are facing a possible recession within a year. This week, the World Bank estimated that west African economies will suffer a $36.2bn hit by the end of next year if Ebola is not brought under control. It is a dramatic, sudden and deeply frustrating turn of events.</p> <p>Our first priority to is to erect a robust economic safety net. The Liberian government has just signed a <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201409180760.html" title="">$52m grant with the World Bank</a>, $10m from the African Development Bank, and $5m from USAid to assist the government specifically with the Ebola fight. The IMF also approved our request for a special funding of $49m to support our budget.</p> <p>Yet this must be just the beginning. The Liberian economy has been all but paralysed. This will inevitably lead to a widening budget deficit and the curtailing of critical public investment projects. Budget-deficit estimates continue to pile up as the crisis drags on, with the latest figures as high as $130m. International financial institutions will have to continue to invest in vital health infrastructure, and support institutions that keep fundamental services intact. This must of course be in addition to the immediate need for medical supplies, health facilities and expertise.</p> <p>The government has already lost revenue equivalent to 25% of our annual receipts. While images of hospitals and dying patients saturate the international media, it is the hidden story of closed schools, unpaid teachers, underfunded security forces and absent local services that could threaten the very fabric of Liberian life.</p> <p>We will also need to unblock other critical arteries of our economy. The decimation of international air routes and the slow, grinding halt of cross-border trade must be resuscitated. This may not be possible at this stage of the outbreak, but the severing of Liberians from the outside world has destroyed livelihoods and driven many families into economic despair.</p> <p>The economic fallout from this crisis cannot be contained: our entire globalised economic system has a stake in this fight. Only this week, equity indexes have fallen in major cities and travel firms’ shares have dived with fears of further air-travel restrictions for holidaymakers and businesses. International financial institutions, resources companies and other large corporations have interests throughout the region. From cashews to cocoa to iron ore and oil, the ramifications of a west Africa cast adrift from the world economy are immense.</p> <p>For many young democracies in west Africa, the collective memory of political unrest, internal conflict and social upheaval is not far away. Over the past decade the region has, commendably, emerged from a history of conflict into a new era of vibrant and dynamic economic growth and cohesion. This is despite religious, ethnic and political division. Ebola risks marginalising and demotivating a whole generation of citizens through economic exclusion and poverty. The consequences for law and order and national unity are obvious. We simply cannot allow this to happen.</p> <p>Our financing must therefore be calculated and targeted. International financial institutions, private companies and donor countries must work together with the affected governments to ensure long-term economic damage is mitigated. In Liberia, this means filling an unexpected deficit quickly and keeping basic services online. Looking further ahead, planned infrastructure projects must not be allowed to dissolve away, and foreign investors must remain reassured and engaged. Support for community infrastructure and economic livelihood projects, particularly in Ebola-affected rural areas, should form a core of any post-Ebola strategy.</p> <p>The majority of Liberians have not contracted Ebola. But for every working family faced with ruined harvests, closed mines or empty markets, Ebola seems like a curse. It is a cruel fate for a people who in a single generation have already suffered immeasurably. This is why we are not just fighting a disease, but for the economic survival of a nation.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/cdc-health-ebola-inquiries-dallas-death <p>Since the first diagnosis of the disease in the US, the American public has become keenly aware of Ebola’s dangerous reach. <br /></p> <p>As concern rises, the nation’s public health agency said it receives hundreds of inquiries a day about possible Ebola cases, and all but one have been false alarms.<br /></p> <p>“Right now there is only one patient who’s ever been diagnosed with Ebola in the US and that individual tragically died,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Tom Frieden said on Wednesday, as news of a potential second patient – who ultimately tested negative for the virus – began to spread. </p> <p>He said the agency receives on average 800 inquiries a day about potential Ebola cases, up from about 50 before Thomas Eric Duncan, who died on Wednesday, was diagnosed with the disease at a hospital in Texas. Frieden said the added attention is positive because it means people are appropriately concerned about the virus that has killed nearly 4,000 people across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>“We expect that we will see more rumors or concerns or possibilities of cases,” Frieden cautioned last week. “Until there is a positive laboratory test that is what they are: rumors and concerns.”<br /></p> <p>Those words looked prescient on Thursday, when the negative test results came back for deputy, Sgt <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-dallas-deputy-sheriff-hospital-symptoms-death">Michael Monnig</a> of the Dallas County Sheriff’s department, the subject of Wednesday’s reports about a possible second patient. Monnig had, in his official capacity, entered the apartment where Duncan had stayed before he was admitted to hospital.</p> <p>Responding to the growing concern that the virus might spread further, the US government announced on Wednesday that travelers from the three most affected west African countries will face enhanced screenings at five key American airports. </p> <p>But for a handful of lawmakers, these changes were not enough. Twenty-six members of the US House of Representatives, including three Democrats, signed a letter to President Barack Obama on Thursday imploring the administration to implement a travel ban on the three most affected west African nations, and impose visa restrictions on citizens from those countries. The administration, backed by public health officials, has previously said it will not ban travel from these countries.</p> <p>Speaking in Washington on Thursday, US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said he’d like more countries to implement Ebola screenings. </p> <p>“My goal is that we create internationally as many different checkpoints as possible for travelers to go through the system,” Reuters reported Johnson saying at Washington think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p> <p>Meanwhile, about 200 airline cabin cleaners went on strike at New York’s LaGuardia airport on Thursday, to protest what they say are working conditions that do not protect against Ebola, among other diseases.</p> <p>“God forbid we get a disease like Ebola, Hepatitis, even AIDS, for $9 an hour it’s not worth it,” said Wendy Arellano, one of the strikers. “They’re not going to take care of us. They’re not going to take care of my kids if something happens to me,”</p> <p>Elsewhere in the US, there are two Americans undergoing treatment for Ebola: a freelance journalist and a World Health Organization (WHO) doctor.<br /></p> <p> Ashoka Mukpo, who <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/04/us-ebola-patient-ashoka-mukpo-liberia">contracted the disease while covering the outbreak</a> in Liberia with NBC News, is undergoing treatment at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. He received a blood transfusion from an American medical missionary who recovered from the disease. Doctors are hopeful that the blood of survivors could be used to help sick patients’ immune systems fight off the disease. <br /></p> <p>The other Ebola patient, who has not been identified for privacy reasons, contracted the disease in Sierra Leone and is still receiving treatment at Emory University hospital in Atlanta, the hospital confirmed on Thursday. </p> <p>Three other Americans, including the doctor who donated his blood, have survived the illness after treatment in the US, which included experimental drugs. One American has died in the current outbreak, a civil servant with dual American-Liberian citizenship and Nigeria’s Ebola patient zero.</p>

Most people live hand-to-mouth, earning just enough money each day to feed their families and pay the rent. Shopkeepers buy in from Bo or Freetown, where prices are cheaper. Taxi drivers make their living doing the Bo to Kenema run. </p> <p><strong>“The vehicles are going nowhere</strong>,” says Amara, a driver:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>They are just parked.

I wanted to take a picture of him for my children in the future but they would not allow me. So I went home and cried.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The number of children orphaned by Ebola is unknown. The NGO Street Child says that, in Kenema, the figure is at least 100. These children face very uncertain futures. Some have family in other cities who cannot help them because they simply cannot get through the road blocks. The <strong>numbers of children on the streets </strong>will swell if no-one comes to their aid.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2014-10-09T21:40:27.649+01:00">at 9.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-5436ed80e4b0cd82a095f15b" class="block is-key-event"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-09T21:20:59.648+01:00">9.20pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Australian nurse cleared of Ebola</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>A Red Cross nurse in far north <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland">Queensland</a>, Australia, who was undergoing tests in an isolation unit to see if she is <strong>suffering from Ebola, has been cleared,</strong> Queensland Health has reported. </p> <p>A <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/09/ebola-fears-woman-observation-cairns-hospital-sierra-leone">Guardian report</a> from earlier today has details of her case:<br /></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The nurse, named in the media as Sue-Ellen Kovack, 57, returned to Australia on Tuesday after a month working in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/sierraleone">Sierra Leone</a>, one of the countries hardest hit by the epidemic which has so far claimed almost 3,900 lives across five west African countries.</p> <p>She was under observation in Cairns hospital, Queensland’s chief health officer, Jeanette Young, confirmed.</p> <p>She had been kept in home isolation and was admitted to hospital with a low-grade fever on Thursday.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/09/ebola-fears-woman-observation-cairns-hospital-sierra-leone">Read more here.</a></p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2014-10-09T21:22:12.263+01:00">at 9.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-5436ea7ee4b0537810a48173" class="block"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-09T21:05:29.490+01:00">9.05pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Ebola aid: Who’s pledged what?</strong></p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/GdnDevelopment/statuses/520302927848943616">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Who&#39;s pledged what for the international effort to tackle Ebola <a href="http://t.co/sIOQGzaadq">http://t.co/sIOQGzaadq</a></p>&mdash; Global Development (@GdnDevelopment) <a href="https://twitter.com/GdnDevelopment/status/520302927848943616">October 9, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id="block-5436e855e4b0537810a48170" class="block is-key-event"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-09T21:00:04.420+01:00">9.00pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Dallas county deputy tests negative for Ebola</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The Texas Department of State Health Services announced Thursday a deputy sheriff in the Dallas suburb of Frisco who had entered the apartment where Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed <strong>has tested negative for Ebola.</strong></p> <p>It <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-dallas-deputy-sheriff-hospital-symptoms-death">had been feared</a> that the deputy, identified as <strong>Michael West Monnig,</strong> had contracted Ebola after he exhibited flu-like symptoms.</p> <p>The health services completed testing of a specimen submitted today by Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, it said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The result is negative for Ebola.</p> </blockquote> <p>Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, which is treating the deputy, said his health is improving. “<strong>Mr Monnig’s condition is good with no fever, </strong>no vomiting, no diarrhea reported.

So when I got it I was very down. For me to walk, it was hard when I got that. So, I tried by all means. I drank my oral rehydration salts and the nurses helped me when I was weak. They gave me my medicine. Where I was, so many people died in my presence. In the morning, I would get on my knees and crawl. I was very sick when I got to the International Medical Corps centre. And the day that I left from there was a joyful day. So, I’m very happy.</p> <p><strong>What more do you think could be done to help people survive Ebola by organisations on the ground?</strong></p> <p>Bring personal protective equipment (PPE), because PPE is something that can only be used one time. And nurses go in there three times a day, and the patients are becoming more. So the thing I’m telling them to help us with is PPE, so that people will be able to go and take care of the patients. Without the PPE, you can’t go in there. Even if the patient is dying, you can’t go in there, because you have to protect yourself. So I’m asking them to please come in with more help like these International Medical Corps people have, more PPE and equipment--medicines, gloves, IV drips to help the other people there.</p> <p><strong>As a survivor you probably won’t get sick again, how does this change how you feel about being around the virus?</strong></p> <p>I feel alright. Even if I enter a place with people with Ebola, I know I cannot get Ebola. So I’m free now. I’m happy I will not get it. And if I enter in there, I will be happy talking with them, counselling them, telling them what to do to be safe like me. </p> <p><strong><strong>Will you return to nursing those with the disease?</strong></strong></p> <p> Yes, if I’m strong enough to walk, I will return to nursing, because I’m an Ebola-free patient now. I can never get Ebola in my life again.</p> <p><strong>Having seen other Ebola victims first hand and after suffering the disease yourself, what is the reality of suffering Ebola, and what sort of thoughts went through your mind when you were diagnosed and ill?</strong></p> <p>When I was at Phebe Hospital, there were five nurses that left to Monrovia for treatment. It was a day of so much crying. But none of them came back to Phebe. So when I got Ebola, when I suspected that I had Ebola, for all I knew, I was not going to come back. That was the only thing I could think. My friends, never came back. They tried by all means, but not one of them came back. Now, about eight of them have died. I survived. </p> <p>I was afraid. I was walking up and down, and I would sit in here, because I didn’t want anyone to come around me. So I stayed in the back of the house. In the night I would leave the room and come out here and lie on the ground, so nobody would come close. I told them, I am getting the virus they are all talking about. So I was very afraid. I told them the next place they would take me, I would not come back. I told them, take care of each other, because I’m not going to come back, because Ebola kills and there is no medicine for it. Only the International Medical Corps centre was able to save me.</p> <p><strong>Have you returned to your regular state of health or are you still suffering from any lingering symptoms? And have any of your symptoms caused permanent physical damage?</strong></p> <p>I still have pains in my joints. But when I try by all means, I can move around. The symptoms I had when I had Ebola, I don’t have those symptoms anymore. They have all gone away. I can eat.</p> <p>I’m improving. Sometimes in the morning, I take the broom and I start sweeping. They try to take the broom from me, but I say no, it’s small exercise. I also try to make the fire, and they try to tell me no, but I say I want to try to do things as I did before. I’m relearning how to do them.</p> <p><strong>Assuming you have been observing media coverage of the Ebola outbreak, is there some bit of information that has so far not been communicated, or perhaps not communicated prominently enough, that you think the public should be aware of?</strong></p> <p>Stigma. The people who used to pass by here, now they pass on the road. The journalists need to tell people not to stigmatize us. They stigmatize the children, they tell them, don’t go in that yard or you’ll get Ebola. When you pass, pass with speed, run! Run and pass them before Ebola gets you. So that’s what I want to tell them.</p> <p>Keep on telling people, Ebola is a real sickness. It’s no joke. People are still here denying it. </p> <p>Read an <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/oct/09/ebola-disease-in-a-day-live#block-54368ea7e4b04997e4a351c8">interview with Ebola survivor Will Pooley</a>, and an<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/oct/09/ebola-disease-in-a-day-live#block-54368617e4b09ceaddbcada9"> interview with Ebola survivor Harrison Sakilla </a></p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2014-10-09T20:13:25.534+01:00">at 8.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-5436dc15e4b0cd82a095f148" class="block is-key-event"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-09T20:05:39.324+01:00">8.05pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">France says Ebola not suspected in quarantine</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Kim Willsher (<a href="https://twitter.com/kimwillsher1">@kimwillsher1</a>) in Paris reports for the Guardian that an alert was lifted around a social services building in the Paris suburb of Cergy-Pontoise after two hours on Thursday evening after the French authorities said fears of Ebola amounted to a false alarm.</p> <p>French authorities sealed off a building near Paris on concerns about Ebola on Thursday after four people inside fell ill with headaches and fever, Reuters reported:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“The suspicion (of Ebola) is lifted,” said the official in the town of Cergy Pontoise, northwest of Paris. </p> <p>Police and interior ministry sources had said earlier the social services building was sealed off with 60 people inside after the four people, who arrived in France from Guinea in early October, fell ill.

As part of Street Child’s campaign to support 1,000 Ebola orphans, it is our hope that we can provide immediate support for the majority of these orphans in the form of food, clothing and, where needed, medical support. Street Child will then undergo a reunification process to provide these orphans with the care of a relative or foster carer. </p> <p>In Kenema, everybody is greatly challenged, which makes the work of Street Child all the more important; we have identified 116 post-quarantined households who need support. This afternoon I will visit these families and assess how many children they have, and how best Street Child can support the primary breadwinner. Our aim is that these children are cared for and can return to school when schools are re-opened. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>From Makeni, John Momodu Kargbo, head of operations for the rural Bombali</strong> district, passes on an account of a runaway grandmother and child:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>As Street Child staff conducted their morning visits to quarantined homes in Makeni we were told of an old grandmother who had run away with a baby believed to be suffering from Ebola; she had refused to take the child for treatment. </p> <p>This was two weeks ago and they are currently feared dead. In this remote cluster of seven houses, known as Masuba, losses have been great, tens of people have died and more are feared infected. </p> <p>Street Child is also stepping up our engagement with Street Children living permanently on the streets.

Will let you know when I do!</p> <p><strong>When you got sick what helped you get through it? </strong></p> <p>World class care, a wonderful family and Zmapp!</p> <p><strong>Having seen other Ebola victims firsthand and after suffering the disease yourself, what is the reality?</strong></p> <p>For me it was all about the fear of the symptoms. I was afraid of the vomiting, bleeding and mental disturbance. I was lucky that I didn’t develop any of these.</p> <p><strong>Have you returned to your regular state of health?</strong><br /></p> <p>I really felt fully recovered to 100 percent health before I was discharged or about 10 days after my diagnosis. I know of other survivors that suffer fatigue and weakness long after clearing the virus. Patients that get very sick before recovering may suffer longer term internal organ damage. Again I was fortunate enough to escape all this. </p> <p><strong>What’s the period of time is between someone beginning to recover, and being declared non-contagious?</strong><br /></p> <p>When someone recovers and symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding etc) disappear people can be considered broadly non-contagious. At this point they will no longer be heavily shedding virus into the environment. Patients are officially declared virus free and can then be considered non-contagious when bodily fluids are tested and are negative. Semen is an exception and may be infectious long after all else is negative. Times scales vary for all of this from a few days from beginning to recover until virus negative (except semen) and a few weeks. <br /></p> <p><strong>Considering the presumable immunity of survivors, do you think it would be feasible to adopt a policy of recruiting and training volunteer survivors to carry out high-risk work on the ground as the epidemic grows?</strong></p> <p>I think training up immune survivors could be really helpful. The care required by an ebola patient in a resource-poor setting is generally very basic. Helping to keep them clean, assisting them with food and fluid and keeping them in the right place. Medication and IV fluids obviously need to be left to trained professionals but most care can be performed by minimally trained workers, providing they are kind and compassionate. </p> <p>However, it appears that many healthcare workers are being infected in the community as sick neighbours go to see the nurse, say, that lives next door. I encountered this scenario many times in Sierra Leone. So healthcare workers will continue to get infected whether they get onto the ward or not.</p> <p><strong>What more do you think could be done to help people survive Ebola by MSF and the the other organisations on the ground?</strong></p> <p>I think considerable improvements in care could be made by those acting on the ground currently. Aside from the obvious need for more beds, I would emphasise the need to give each Ebola patient the best chance possible. This means treating patients very proactively with IV fluids and appropriate medicines. Currently many think that the best we can do is isolate patients. I believe firmly in treating patients. More people survive if they receive more aggressive supportive therapy.</p> <p><em>Leave further questions for Pooley or Ebola survivors Harrison Sakilla or Comfort Kollie in the comments.</em></p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2014-10-09T15:27:42.152+01:00">at 3.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-5436910ae4b01716247a0443" class="block"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-09T14:54:05.205+01:00">2.54pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Airline bosses believe there is no significant change needed to protect passengers, and say wider travel has not been affected,<em> reports Guardian transport correspondent <strong>Gwyn Topham</strong></em> </p> <p><strong>Willie Walsh</strong>, the chief executive of IAG, which controls British Airways, spoke at length to the Guardian and others about Ebola last Friday. British Airways stopped flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone in August, but Walsh said: “The reason we stopped was that the demand was affected by the outbreak so it was very much a commercial decision first and foremost. <br /></p> <p>“All of the medical advice we received was that there was no risk to us.

It’s clearly a tragedy for the countries involved ... but the experience that we’ve had flying into the region is that the risk is very low. This is a disease that only gets transmitted by direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions. </p> <p>Airlines have become sensitive to any suggestion that they are helping spread the disease, and Walsh said of Thomas Duncan, the Ebola patient who has since died in Dallas: “He hasn’t spread it to another continent. He [had] it. </p> <p>He said the airline would continue to evalutate whether additional measures need to be taken. </p> <p>Despite the confidence of airline bosses, airline and travel stocks have fallen in recent days as investors feared a perceived Ebola risk would deter the public from travelling abroad. <br /></p> <p>Walsh said there had been no impact on wider demand for flying away from directly affected areas. Walsh insisted there was “absolutely no impact on bookings other than on services to cities directly involved. We haven’t seen any changes to booking patterns and Europe has been aware of this for several months.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2014-10-09T14:58:04.142+01:00">at 2.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-54368deee4b04997e4a351c7" class="block is-key-event"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-09T14:39:50.054+01:00">2.39pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Kenema dispatch: Quarantined and hungry</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><em><strong>Hazel Chandler</strong> is a documentary maker returned from the epicentre of the outbreak in Kenema</em></p> <p>The Aruna Street community in Kenema was placed under a 21 day quarantine after five of its members died. <br /></p> <p>So many got sick that at the end of the 21 days a further 21 days was imposed.

It’s a disease that when you are infected with the virus, even your family cannot come close to you. Even the nurses can only be close to you if they have all the material to protect themselves when they touch you or feed you.</p> <p>You have weakness in the body. You are not even able to move and you have diarrhoea. As for me I never had vomiting, but I had a really strong headache and joint pains. I felt very, very weak.</p> <p>The major thing is the worry. Before people said Ebola has no treatment, so you have to worry. Most get worried, because of the way the disease is explained. Ebola has no treatment, so you think, “How will I live?”</p> <p>After I started being treated for the symptoms, I started to recover and to feel better, but plenty around me were dying. When I saw the people dying I felt scared. But I was given courage by the nurses that said even though some are dying, you can recover.</p> <p><strong>As survivors you probably won’t get sick again, how does this change how you feel about being around the virus?</strong></p> <p>Well, to the understanding that when you are cured from Ebola you will not easily get the disease again, I say, it depends if you are taking precautions, because the major thing is precaution. Then you can keep by the side of somebody who is contaminated with the virus. Even though some people say you are safe if you have recovered, but you don’t play with this disease. You have to keep up the precautions. The reason is – even if you cannot get it, but you touch the person who has the virus, you might simply pass it to somebody else who then may not survive from Ebola. So that’s why it’s best not to play with the virus.</p> <p><strong>When you got sick what were the most important things that helped you get through it?</strong></p> <p>You have to call for the ambulance, call the health worker. Then the second thing, they take you to the Ebola management centre. Then they will start to treat you. They take your blood, to test your blood. If you are positive they will help treat the symptoms you are showing. Then they feed you, give you food, give you clean clothes, plates, a spoon and cups to drink, as well as a bucket, water and soap for taking a bath.</p> <p>The nurses can give you courage and medication for the symptoms. There is no medication for the virus, but by reducing the symptoms that you are showing, it can help.</p> <p><strong>What more do you think could be done to help people survive Ebola by MSF and the the other organisations on the ground?</strong></p> <p>To my understanding, the best thing is to carry awareness to the community and the people in the area about Ebola. Also to tell them the facts about the disease as it is rare and people they don’t know. As mentioned before, we should take people like me who are survivors to be part of the awareness, to tell the people the truth. As MSF is doing so much of this already, others should also help and MSF should continue.</p> <p><strong>Considering the presumable immunity of survivors, do you think it would be feasible to adopt a policy of recruiting and training volunteer survivors to carry out high-risk work on the ground as the epidemic grows?</strong></p> <p>There is a lot we still don’t know about this disease. But as there is at least a theoretical and potential risk to survivors working in high-risk areas they will need to follow exactly the same procedures as anyone else. It is too early in the epidemic to say that those who have survived will never be at risk of reinfection. It is better to be cautious and to take full protective measures.</p> <p>Survivors can carry awareness messages for Ebola. Survivors understand the disease. They know the symptoms, they have suffered so much while they are recovering – it’s hard to cope with the bleeding and diarrhoea. It’s a hard task for you. Also, they will be able to tell people facts about the sickness. They know all about it including what Ebola does to you. For this reason it’s very good if survivors can work in health promotion.</p> <p><em>Leave further questions for Sakilla or Ebola survivors Will Pooley or Comfort Kollie in the comments.</em></p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2014-10-09T15:21:50.893+01:00">at 3.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-54368559e4b01716247a0425" class="block"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-10-09T14:01:14.408+01:00">2.01pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The condition of the Spanish nurse infected with Ebola has worsened, <em>reports <strong>Ashifa Kassam</strong> in Madrid</em>.</p> <p>Her brother José Ramón Romero told reporters at the Carlos III hospital that her health had deteriorated and she was now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation">intubated</a>.

He was deliberately given a virus as it gets inside cells and produces a particular type of immunity. A chimp virus is being used as people are often immune to human common colds, meaning the vaccine wouldn’t have a chance to begin to work. Essentially, it’s a process of tricking the immune system into thinking it has an infection. <br /><br />He said: “The day after I had the vaccine I felt a bit fluey and had a sore arm but by the evening I was absolutely fine. I think it’s a really small price to pay for what we can potentially get out of this vaccine if it’s going to prevent outbreaks of the magnitude we have seen so far this year.”<br /><br />Owen, who works for MSF but has been taking part in the trials as a volunteer (the charity has no connection with the trials) has also <a href="http://blogs.msf.org/en/staff/blogs/msf-ebola-blog/subject-001016-the-vaccine-trial">written a blog about his experience</a>.<br /></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Friends and family have said I must be mad to want to take part, but I struggle to see the issue.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/ebola-scare-race-frisco-dallas-texas-monnig-duncan <p>Frisco, a prosperous and bland modern suburb 25 miles north of downtown Dallas, is normally chiefly known as the home of Major League Soccer’s FC Dallas and the RoughRiders minor league baseball team.</p> <p>But for a time on Wednesday it was the epicentre of the rolling-news universe, as events at an urgent care centre prompted scenes reminiscent of a contagion disaster movie. Media <a href="http://www.wfaa.com/story/news/health/2014/10/08/patient-frisco-ebola-suspect/16922477/">rushed to provide live coverage</a> of a sheriff’s deputy in a surgical mask being taken to a hospital isolation room by men covered from head to toe in protective clothing.</p> <p>The deputy, Michael Monnig, did visit the apartment where Thomas Eric Duncan, who died from the virus on Wednesday, had stayed after arriving in the US from Liberia. But on Thursday afternoon, Texas officials said Monnig had tested negative for the virus.</p> <p>Still, on Wednesday no one was taking any chances; better to risk alarming the general population by responding urgently and forcefully with officials in hazmat gear than prompt fresh doubts about the competence of authorities by downplaying the drama, acting slowly and not wearing any protective clothes at all.</p> <p>The contrast in the speed and scale of the response in Frisco compared with events at the low-rent Ivy Apartments complex was jarring: despite confirmation on Tuesday last week that Duncan had Ebola, it was not until last Thursday that the authorities made a concerted effort to control who could enter and exit the apartment where he had stayed, and not until Saturday before the unit was cleaned and decontaminated by a professional crew. As various local and federal agencies appeared to debate and dawdle, the action achieved the rare feat of seeming at once chaotic and slow-moving.</p> <p>The 5,000- to 10,000-strong Liberian community in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex has noted shortcomings in the way Duncan’s case was handled. Official accounts suggest he first developed symptoms on 24 September and went to nearby Texas Health Presbyterian hospital two days later, where staff failed to take his travel history into account and sent him away with antibiotics. By 28 September he was so ill that an ambulance was called to take him back.</p> <p>Without making any specific judgment on Duncan’s case, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Tom Frieden said at a media briefing on Wednesday that “the earlier someone is diagnosed, the more likely they will be able to survive.”</p> <p>Three other patients hospitalised in the US after contracting Ebola in west Africa, including one man from Fort Worth, received experimental treatments and survived. On Tuesday, Dallas County commissioner John Wiley Price, who is black, told a court meeting that “if a person who looks like me shows up without any insurance, they don’t get the same treatment … It’s historically what has happened in this community.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="888aaa17e1b1664aeeabaf29670753b0facc5307"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/9/1412886553885/1d171239-c62b-4bdf-9669-7646eb4218ad-460x276.jpeg" alt="Frisco emergency personnel cordon off Michael Monnig's vehicle" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Frisco emergency personnel cordoned off Michael Monnig’s vehicle.

Smith/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stanley Gaye, president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, said that many people were raising questions about the standard of care Duncan received, but he is urging the community to keep anger in check and wait until Duncan’s fiancee, Louise Troh, and the rest of her quarantined family are given the all-clear.</p> <p>“They have questions about the hospital and how the family was treated and how he was treated. Those are all the concerns, but I told them this is not a time to talk about it, this is a time to grieve with the family and pray for the family,” he said. “The proper thing to do is to investigate and see if they did anything intentional.”</p> <p>“This is a city that lived through JFK. We don’t want any more of that happening,” said Troh’s pastor, George Mason. “We don’t want that sort of thing to reoccur. Anybody that’s lived in Dallas for a long period of time would tell you that that story haunts the city of Dallas. We believe we have come a long way since then and we have much more transparency,” he said.</p> <p>Apparently responding to these kinds of concerns, the hospital released a statement Thursday in which it said, “We’d like to correct some misconceptions that have been reported about Mr. Duncan’s first visit. Our care team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and care that would be given [to] any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care. In this case that included a four-hour evaluation and numerous tests. We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area.”</p> <p>Allegations of official cover-ups and a lack of transparency cut deeper here than in many places. Texas is an independent-minded state with an innate distrust of the federal government and Dallas is still best known for some people as the site of the assassination of John F Kennedy, an event that inspired perhaps the most famous and enduring collection of conspiracy theories in Western culture.</p> <p>“We’re looking for moments to help correct the view of Dallas or to have some redemption about that, to be honest. This was a moment, and you realise we might have had another bobble as we began, but these public officials now are redoubling their efforts to see that we can do everything right in the wake of it.”</p> <p>The geography of Duncan’s sickness and death has also underlined that this is a city, like so many in America, with a stark racial and economic divide.</p> <p>On the north Dallas landscape, opulent shopping malls and the sprawling hospital campus act as a kind of bulwark separating the densely populated and deprived Vickery Meadow area – home to a diverse range of immigrants, including Troh – from some of the richest residents in America a short drive to the west across Highway 75. That area, Highland Park, almost entirely white and home to the George W Bush Presidential Library, was <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/12/highland-park-texas-gop-stronghold">described by Mother Jones</a> in 2011 as “the most enthusiastically Republican enclave in the country”.</p> <p>The Ebola scare has prompted a rare moment of crossover between the two communities. The Dallas Morning News <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20141007-highland-park-isd-parents-told-jenkins-hasnt-created-risk.ece ">reported</a> that the Highland Park school district sent a note aiming to reassure parents that their children could not contract Ebola through contact with the daughter of Clay Jenkins, a judge who is in charge of emergency management for Dallas County and who drove Troh and her family from her apartment to a temporary home in an undisclosed location.</p> <p>Vickery Meadow is no longer invisible. “One of my own hopes is that out of all of this, at least people in Dallas could raise their awareness of the conditions in Vickery Meadow. It is not good and it has not been good for a long time,” said Mark Wingfield, associate pastor at Troh’s church. “There is substandard housing, it is in many places an urban ghetto and I think most people in Dallas if they don’t ever drive through there don’t even know it exists.”</p> <p>But so far the publicity and alarm appear to have made locals even more unwilling to circulate in the area. Attendance at schools near Troh’s apartment was down 10% in the wake of news that five area pupils may have come into contact with Duncan, according to Dallas school district figures.</p> <p>The Dallas Foundation, which links donors with non-profit agencies, said in a statement that it is focusing efforts on helping Vickery Meadow because “the backlash from this attention has had negative consequences for a neighborhood already plagued by poverty, affecting residents’ ability to work as well as the delivery of volunteer services within the community.”</p> <p>Alben Tarty, a Liberian community spokesman, said a fear of stigmatisation after the first diagnosed case of Ebola in the US has led to “rumours” that some Liberians’ jobs might be in jeopardy.</p> <p>Tarty said he has heard stories of home care workers and food handlers being sent home from their jobs because their employers feared they might have been exposed to the disease. He said he doesn’t know if the stories are true; nonetheless, their mere circulation has made some in the community very anxious.</p> <p>With Duncan the only confirmed case, Ebola’s capacity to frighten is so far greatly outpacing its ability to infect Texans. “The concern is the stress of this and the fear of this could be more damaging to the community than the virus itself,” Lakey said at a news conference on Monday.</p> <p>Dallas is waiting to discover whether any of the 10 people in Texas officials say had close contact with Duncan, as well as 38 others who may have had contact, will present Ebola symptoms. According to the CDC, the maximum incubation period is 21 days but symptoms usually start to show 8 to 10 days after exposure. If nothing develops by the end of the week, confidence will grow that, despite the missteps which delayed his move into isolation, Duncan will remain the city’s lone case, and Dallas’s affected communities can start rebuilding trust and repairing social fractures.</p> <p>“We are very hopeful and keep praying that it continues that way,” said Gaye.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/10/ebola-australian-nurse-returns-negative-blood-test <p>An Australian nurse who has just returned from west Africa has returned a negative test result for Ebola.<br /></p> <p>Sue Ellen Kovack was tested for the virus on Thursday after developing a low-grade fever upon her return to Australia after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. She was held in isolation at Cairns hospital and her blood samples were flown to Brisbane for testing.</p> <p>Queensland’s chief health officer, Jeannette Young, confirmed on Friday morning that the initial tests had returned a negative result. Kovack will continue to be held in hospital for at least 24 hours. She will be tested again at the weekend.</p> <p>“This is a necessary precaution given the patient has been to west Africa and has had a fever within the incubation period of 21 days,” Young said. “For the sake of her health and to follow due diligence, we want to be sure she is clear of Ebola virus disease as well as any other disease.”</p> <p>Young said even if Kovack had tested positive for Ebola the wider community had not been at risk. Kovack had been held in home isolation since her return from Sierra Leone on Tuesday and had not developed the symptoms of Ebola which make it contagious, such as vomiting and diarrhoea.</p> <p>Health minister Peter Dutton said 11 people across Australia had been tested for Ebola and all had returned negative results as he warned against community panic.</p> <p>“I want people to put things in perspective here, it’s not spread by people coughing … the chances of it being spread here are next to nil. We have the ability to deal with people and rapidly test,” he told reporters in Melbourne.<br /></p> <p>Dutton said he was “very satisfied” with the advice the government had received from Young, other health officials and immigration officials about how to best handle people coming back to Australia from Ebola-affected countries.<br /></p> <p>He dismissed independent MP Bob Katter’s comments that Australians should be held in official isolation for three weeks and humanitarian workers were putting all of Australia at risk.<br /></p> <p>“I’m happy for Mr Katter to be briefed and informed on these matters before he makes any further public comment so he’s properly informed about Ebola and [the] risk that it poses,” he said.<br /></p> <p>He said Kovack’s initial negative result was a “huge relief” for her, as well as the government.<br /></p> <p>Queensland will now hold health workers returning from west Africa in Brisbane, rather than their own homes in other parts of the state, so treatment can be swift if they are diagnosed with the virus, the state’s health minister Lawrence Springborg said.<br /></p> <p>“In the case of this nurse, she has been extremely responsible and followed all precautionary guidelines since she has returned from treating sick people in Africa,” he said.</p> <p>“We’re encouraged this … first test of this nurse has shown this is a negative result [but] there is an incubation period that goes for up to 21 days.”</p> <p>Young also dismissed Katter’s concerns, defending Australian health workers who have gone to west Africa to treat people with the virus.</p> <p>“I have every confidence that her and other people like her who have gone over to west Africa to give of their skills, which I admire tremendously, to do what they’ve done will not put any Australian at harm. They are genuine, true, fantastic health professionals who are practising their profession so I’m not concerned by it,” she said.</p> <p>The head of the Australian Red Cross international program, Peter Walton, said Kovack had an “anxious wait” on Friday morning but was in good spirits while in isolation at Cairns hospital. He said she was aware of the intense media speculation and the discussion her case had caused in the wider community, including questions about whether Australian aid workers should be travelling to west Africa.<br /></p> <p>“If we don’t make a contribution, the risk of this expanding and becoming much more than a regional concern is absolutely going to be the case,” he told ABC News 24. “So we should be doing more. And I think Australian aid workers like Sue Ellen are incredibly brave being at the frontline.”</p> <p>Walton said Kovack was a clinical nurse who had worked in a Red Cross Ebola treatment centre about 180km from Freetown.</p> <p>The Australian government has resisted calls to send health professionals to west Africa to help with the epidemic.</p> <p>“The worst-case scenarios are that it’s going to be keep doubling every three weeks [and] there will be over 1.4m people affected,” Walton said. “That is the worst-case scenario but more needs to be done. We certainly hope that won’t be the case.”</p> <p>Queensland’s premier, Campbell Newman, cautiously welcomed the news of Kovack’s initial negative result. “Let’s keep our fingers crossed for the patient involved,” he told reporters in Canberra, where he has travelled for a Council of Australian Governments meeting.</p> <p>Almost 4,000 people have died from Ebola in west Africa and Kovack was one of several Australians who have travelled to the region to help treat patients there.</p> <p>A doctor is in home isolation in south Brisbane after returning from treating Ebola patients overseas.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/train-immune-ebola-survivors-help-medics-uk-nurse-will-pooley <p>The British nurse who survived Ebola has said he believes immune survivors should be trained to assist healthcare workers in the fight against the disease.</p> <p>Will Pooley hopes to return to Sierra Leone after doctors advised him he would have antibodies to make him immune to the virus for months to come.</p> <p>About 50% of those who contract the disease survive, and Pooley says the public can contribute. “The care required by an Ebola patient in a resource-poor setting is generally very basic. Helping to keep them clean, assisting them with food and fluid, and keeping them in the right place.”</p> <p>He added: “Medication and IV fluids obviously need to be left to trained professionals but most care can be performed by minimally trained workers, providing they are kind and compassionate.”</p> <p>Pooley made his remarks as he recalled how helpful a 17-year-old survivor, Douda Fullah, had been in the Kenema hospital where he worked in an Ebola ward.</p> <p>Douda’s tragic story has been captured on film, with his consent, by the British charity <a href="http://www.street-child.co.uk/ebolaresponse/" title="">Street Child</a>, which is working to support those orphaned by the disease.</p>  <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0oeHB0VQGs"                                                                                > <iframe width="460" height="259" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O0oeHB0VQGs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=26" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Douda Fullah, 17, recounts how the loss of his parents left him looking after two younger siblings. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the film, he recalls how he lost his father, his stepmother, his two-year-old brother, his 13-year-old sister and his grandmother in just 37 days. His stepmother was six months pregnant but miscarried in hospital because of the Ebola virus.</p> <p>“It’s a sad story really, so sad,” said Douda. “I’ve lost five members of my family including my father,” he says as he drops his head into his hands, overcome by emotion. “Presently I am just left without my family and no one to take care of us. I am left with the younger ones.</p> <p>“I have lost five members of my family. I have no one to take care of me ... I’m begging. Come to our aid. We are suffering. There is no hope for us.” </p> <p>Pooley recalled: “I remember his stepmother; she was pregnant, she came in with a little boy ... that’s how I got to know Douda.</p> <p>“He was showing a lot of concern for his little brother. His mum had a really bad prognosis and died a couple of days after miscarrying. Douda was helping her. As a lot of patients do, she had fallen off her bed and died on the floor,” says Pooley.</p> <p>He remembers the other members of Douda’s family vividly, and said Douda played an important role in taking care of them: “It was a strange thing so see him so upset on the video because he was really one of the most helpful patients. He would help his grandmother get to the toilet and he would put on an apron and help others.</p> <p>“If we ever needed anything in the ward, we’d say ‘Douda, Douda’ and he’d get it. He was like an assistant.”</p> <p>“When he was tested again and tested negative, it was like a triumph and everyone cheered. He was so helpful. The last thing I heard was that he had come back to the ward to help,” Pooley said.</p> <p>Orphaned, Douda is now left to care for himself, his 12-year-old brother and 15-year-old sister.</p> <p>“Where am I going to get money to pay another rent, so that we continue to stay in the house. No hope. Let them help us. Let them see us as their children. We are suffering. We really need help, we really need help. Without help I don’t think we move further throughout our lives.</p> <p>“It is really a difficult situation. I am begging, come to our aid, we are suffering, let them come to our aid ... There’s no hope for us,” he says.</p> <p>His tragedy started on 24 July when his father contracted the disease and died a short time later.</p> <p>“Then after his burial, my stepmother, she also got sick. They [took] her to the hospital and the following day I also started feeling symptoms, having fever, headache, so I too decided to go to the hospital. So they took me in for admission with my stepmother and younger brother who was just about two years old.</p> <p>“I stayed to wait for my result. After two days they told me I was also positive, so I was also admitted to the hospital,” recalls Douda. He survived but two days later his 13-year-old sister died, followed by his grandmother eight days later.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/airline-cabin-cleaners-strike-over-ebola-fears-at-laguardia-airport <p>About 200 airline cabin cleaners walked off their jobs at New York’s LaGuardia airport on Thursday, to protest what they say are working conditions that do not protect against potential Ebola contraction.</p> <p>“When I do bathroom, I come in contact with tampons which I have to grab with my hand, with a glove that’s so cheap that it breaks easily. I come in contact with feces, a lot of feces and vomit. And we have to clean those bathrooms spotless because they audit those planes,”<em> </em>Wendy Arellano, one of the workers, told the Guardian.</p> <p>“They expect us, that if a little bit of feces stays on the toilet, that we remove it with our hands because [if not] they will say that bathroom is dirty. And I refuse to do it because I think it’s disgusting and I don’t have the appropriate attire, and because I don’t know what that person has.</p> <p>“We come in contact with a lot of stuff that is dangerous for our health and obviously they don’t give us the appropriate tools to work with.”</p> <p>Workers set up picket lines overnight, by non-unionized Air Serv cleaners near Terminal D. The one-day strike forces airline crews to clean planes themselves.</p> <p>Air Serv, an employer of the people striking today, released a statement in response to the walkout: “Air Serv trains its cabin cleaners in its long-standing safety procedures and cleaning protocols including for blood borne pathogens. These protocols include, but are not limited to, providing cleaners with protective equipment.”</p> <p> “We continually review our policies and procedures for updates and enhancements, and communicate updates to employees, as necessary – for example, including an update on protocols for Ebola just last week. As to the union’s organizing campaign, we have no comment.”</p> <p>Workers on strike, fearing the deadly virus and trying to join the union, briefly left the picket lines to attend an infectious disease training session organized by the union. </p> <p>The Obama administration announced it would step up screening for Ebola symptoms at five major airports, after<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan"> one man died Wednesday in Dallas from the virus</a>, which he contracted in Liberia. LaGuardia, which does not service flights to west Africa – where more than 3,800 people have died due to outbreaks – is not among the airports with increased screenings.</p> <p>A Delta Air Lines spokesperson told Reuters that airline staffers who usually do other terminal jobs had to clean planes themselves, but that no flights were delayed or canceled as a consequence.</p> <p>The striking workers said in a statement that clean-up crews have recently been halved, and that the time to clean an entire plane reduced to as little as five minutes, rather than up to 45. They also protested that their employer does not provide them with face masks for dealing with strong cleaning chemicals.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/imf-ebola-outbreak-un-world-bank <p>The International Monetary Fund has changed its rules to allow the west African countries hit by the Ebola epidemic to borrow more and run up bigger deficits, as the head of the UN said 20 times more money was needed to fight the outbreak described as the biggest global health threat since Aids.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, said it was dropping its normal opposition to extra borrowing for the three worst-hit countries, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Lagarde said it was good to increase budget deficits at the current time, adding: “We don’t say that very often.”</p> <p>Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, said the response to the outbreak that has left almost 4,000 dead had so far been inadequate. “For those who have yet to pledge, I say please do so soon,” he said. “This is an unforgiving disease.”</p> <p>The appeal came as the presidents of the three countries said they could not cope with the crisis and pleaded with the international community to send more help.</p> <p>The world’s response had not kept pace with the spread of Ebola, said Sierra Leone’s president, Ernst Bai Koroma, speaking by video to a summit held at the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, and describing the disease as “a tragedy unforeseen in modern times”.</p> <p>Tom Frieden, director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, told the meeting that Ebola was comparable to Aids. “I have been in public health service for 30 years and the only thing I have seen like this is Aids. We will have to work hard to stop it being the next Aids.”</p> <p>Frieden’s comments came as new suspected cases of Ebola emerged in Australia and Spain and as the chancellor, George Osborne, said Britain would test people coming into the country if advised to do so by medical experts.</p> <p>Alpha Condé, president of Guinea, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, president of Liberia, – also spoke at the World Bank-organised summit, which pledged money, health professionals and hospital beds to help deal with the crisis.</p> <p>The US sent two military planes to Liberia, which has cancelled elections in the latest attempt to stop the spread of the virus.</p> <p>Critics say Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s handling of the crisis has been heavy-handed and ineffective. Police used batons and rattan whips to disperse 100 protesters outside the national assembly, where legislators were debating granting her even more powers beyond those contained in a state of emergency declared in August.</p> <p>Condé said: “This is an international threat and it deserves an international response. All of the West African region is threatened.”</p> <p>After Britain announced on Wednesday that it was scaling up its efforts to curb Ebola, the international development secretary, Justine Greening, called for other countries to do likewise.</p> <p>“If we wait a month the task will be twice as large. It will kill twice as many people and have twice the impact on economies,” she said.</p> <p>Jim Kim, the World Bank president, said: “We are still way, way behind the curve and we have to scale up the global response; there is a critical need for more trained health workers.”</p> <p>Kim also said that more hospitals and local health centres must be built quickly to ensure that west Africans had faith that they could get the care they needed in their own community, and no longer fear Ebola centres as places that people went only to die.</p> <p>Kim, a doctor who formerly led the World Health Organisation’s global Aids treatment programme, said studies of past disease outbreaks, such as the Sars virus, showed that 80-90% of the economic impact came from “the fear factor that surrounds the outbreak”.</p> <p>A World Bank study published on Wednesday said the cost of Ebola could be as high as $33bn (£20bn) for west Africa if it could not be contained. The bank has yet to do a broader assessment of its impact on the rest of the world.</p> <p>Kim said the most urgent humanitarian need was getting medical care to treat people in their own communities. That was also the best way to stop the spread of Ebola to other nations and counter the fear that magnified its economic damage.</p> <p>“Trying to block your borders or isolate those countries in some way is not going to work,” he said.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/09/guardian-view-on-ebola-fighting-fear-as-well-as-infection <p>The lay person is forever wary of being “blinded by science”. But to students of disease, the laws governing the natural world look far simpler than the chaotically unpredictable reaction that their work can often provoke. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Manias-Panics-Crashes-Financial-Investment/dp/0471389455" title="">Panics, manias and crashes attract the attention of economists</a>. There is less systematic study of the way in which crowds react, and over-react, to information in the non-financial realm.</p> <p>As the rich world belatedly grapples with the singularly nasty, but reasonably well-understood, outbreak of Ebola in Africa, fear itself is becoming the primary problem in Europe and America. The pressing need of the victims, who are almost exclusively in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, is plain. They don’t require Live Aid-style charity donations but many more medical workers. So, too, do the far greater number of potential victims in the region, whose contact with the stricken will leave them prone to the frequently fatal virus until sufficient quarantined facilities are up and running. The <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/ebola-what-europe-and-us-can-learn-from-nigeria-in-containing-the-virus-9780273.html" title="">contrast with Nigeria</a>, which is also poor but has – through more organised care – contained Ebola thus far, illustrates the importance of both the volume and the coordination of personnel. But as anxiety in Britain rises to the point where a nine-year-old <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2784698/British-school-bans-nine-year-old-Sierra-Leone-parents-feared-classmates-Ebola.html" title="">Sierra Leonean boy is banned from a Stockport school</a>, despite the headteacher being satisfied that he is not infected, volunteers may be put off from venturing overseas.</p> <p>Thursday saw a hasty refinement of the British approach. Initially, the UK had refused to follow America’s lead and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/us-to-begin-ebola-screenings-at-5-airports.html?_r=0" title="">screen for raised temperatures at airports</a>. The UK’s immediate reservations were well-founded. Ebola’s <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/" title="">virology – non-airborne transmission</a>, incubation of up to 21 days, early symptoms indistinct from many infections – puts a premium on rooting out the problem at source. Quickfire border checks cannot be relied on to keep the virus at bay in Europe if it becomes more entrenched in Africa. Then there are more specific objections to temperature scanners: the countless “false positives” with other fevers that would be picked up, and the even more damaging false reassurance that would be produced if the all-clear were given to genuine Ebola cases where symptoms were still dormant. Subsequently, however, Downing Street signalled that – at selected entry points only – the UK would be running questionnaires about where travellers had been, and what contact they’d had. Checks of this form could be more useful, but they are certainly not failsafe. Thomas Duncan, who died of the virus in Dallas this week, had <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-crisis-world-bank-president-jim-kim-failure" title="">falsely responded</a> to such inquiries, denying he’d been in contact with anyone affected.</p> <p>If there is one cardinal “don’t” in navigating between the science of risk and public anxiety, it is running ahead of the available evidence about what it is, in fact, possible to guarantee. Recall <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/16/newsid_2913000/2913807.stm" title="">John Selwyn Gummer</a> feeding his daughter a beefburger to demonstrate that BSE posed no risk to humans to see why. What of the “dos”? Providing west Africa with the support it needs, including not only the troops already announced but medical practitioners too, is one. The overwhelming importance of on-the-ground resources vindicates David Cameron for, like Gordon Brown and Tony Blair before him, championing international aid. Like all the most important threats facing humanity, viruses are no respecter of borders, and so safety at home requires engagement and generosity overseas. At the same time as readying the NHS to deal with the worst possibility of Ebola’s arrival and transmission within the UK, it is also important to calm popular fears, and more particularly the anxieties of those who might be considering joining the relief effort. David Miliband, now <a href="http://www.rescue.org/david-miliband-biography" title="">president of the International Rescue Committee</a>, has shown the way. Simply by <a href="http://www.rescue.org/press-releases/irc-community-partnership-approach-helps-reduce-ebola-spread-targeted-west-african-co" title="">turning up in Freetown</a>, he makes the point that this is not an infection that lays waste every passing visitor, but rather a disease spread through direct contact, whose progress can be controlled by careful hygiene drills.</p> <p>The virulence of Ebola is not in doubt. No prescription to deal with it will do much good, unless honesty and calm are part of the mix.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/briton-dies-macedonia-suspected-ebola-reports <p>Foreign Office officials are investigating reports that a British national has died in Macedonia of suspected Ebola.</p> <p>If confirmed it would be the first death of a UK national from Ebola, although British nurse Will Pooley was cured of the virus last month.</p> <p>The Macedonian government says it is investigating the death of a British national on its territory after an undiagnosed illness but stressed that the cause of death had not been confirmed.</p> <p>“It is a British citizen who has died. The health ministry is trying to find out what he died from and it needs some time to find out the reason,” a spokesman for Macedonia’s foreign ministry said. “We are following the protocols of what to do in such cases set out by the World Health Organisation.”</p> <p>The director of the commission for infectious disease at the ministry of health, Jovanka Kostovska, said the man, a 56-year-old, had travelled from London to Macedonia on 2 October with a colleague for business. He had been staying at a hotel in the centre of Skopje when he was taken ill with severe stomach ache and increased temperature. The man remained in his hotel room for three days, before an ambulance was called on Thursday afternoon around 3pm local time. He was taken to hospital where he died around 90 minutes later.</p> <p>At this stage Ebola is only suspected, and further tests are to be carried out by a laboratory in Germany to find out if it is the virus or not. Results are expected within 48 hours.</p> <p>Officials said the man’s colleague said that he had not travelled to any country where Ebola was a risk, although the Macedonian health ministry suspected he had visited Nigeria.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/liberia-suspends-elections-ebola-outbreak <p>Liberia has suspended senatorial elections due next week as the country grapples with an accelerating Ebola outbreak that health officials have said poses the biggest public health challenge since the Aids epidemic of the 1980s.</p> <p>At least two million voters, roughly half of the west African nation’s population, were due to elect half of the 30-member upper chamber next Tuesday, but organisers said a “mass movement, deployment and gathering of people” would endanger lives.</p> <p>Restricted numbers of polling staff and low voter turnout would make it impossible to conduct a credible election, the election commission said.</p> <p>The commission’s chairman, Jerome George Korkoya, said transporting and distributing equipment including ballot papers and polling kits had been hampered as international airlines had suspended flights in the wake of the outbreak.</p> <p>“The timely delivery of these materials, most of which are sensitive, cannot be guaranteed in the wake of the current wave of the suspension of flights to Liberia,” he said, adding that a new date would be set, before the end of the year if possible.</p> <p>President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s popularity has taken a battering at home over her handling of the Ebola outbreak. Liberia has recorded 2,200 deaths, more than half of the 3,865 total so far.</p> <p>A presidential request for sweeping emergency powers led to one newspaper running the headline “Flirting with dictatorship” on Thursday. Police used batons and whips to disperse around 100 protesters who had gathered outside the national assembly as politicians debated the request to extend the president’s powers beyond the state of emergency declared in August.</p> <p>On Thursday, Johnson Sirleaf addressed an International Monetary Fund meeting alongside her counterparts from Guinea and Sierra Leone. All three called for a greater international response to help stem the epidemic. “Our people are dying,” Sierra Leone’s president, Ernest Bai Koroma, said by video link.</p> <p>Tom Frieden, director the US Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention, told the meeting: “I have been in public health service for 30 years and the only thing I have seen like this is Aids. We will have to work hard to stop it being the next Aids.”</p> <p>A recent surge of international aid is intended to provide the 2,000-odd beds that are urgently needed. But efforts to recruit medics have been complicated as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/-sp-ebola-west-africa-health-workers" title="">many local health workers have succumbed to the disease</a>.</p> <p>On Thursday a Uganda-born doctor died at a treatment centre on the outskirts of the Liberian capital, Monrovia. He was the fourth doctor to die in the country since the start of the outbreak. A handful of international doctors have also been infected.</p> <p>Experts say many cases are going unreported. The largest number of infections in the past 21 days – a useful measure as it is the longest incubation period of the virus – have come from Sierra Leone. At least 924 cases have been confirmed.</p> <p>The rise has been concentrated in the west of the country, including the capital, Freetown, which previously was largely spared. “We can’t explain exactly why the numbers have gone up in the western area, but we’re going to discuss how to tackle it,” said Brima Kargbo, the chief medical officer.</p> <p>Sierra Leone has 304 beds, which is well short of the 1,100-odd the WHO estimates it needs. Two burial teams in the western area went on strike this week over delayed payment. One worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “We’re risking our lives and we’re not being paid for it. And since we started this work, people have been talking a lot – we’re not welcome in our community any more.”</p> <p>There is one bright spot: new cases have all but stopped in the eastern region bordering Guinea and Liberia, where the transmissions started and were initially highest. Health campaigns and treatment centres are clustered there, and some districts are now going days without reporting any new cases.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2014/oct/09/ebola-crisis-worlds-celebrities-kim-kardashian-akon <p>Lost in Showbiz doesn’t know about you, but it’s barely slept a wink since the beginning of the Ebola crisis. There are so many different and terrible aspects of it that plague the mind: the thousands dead; the inadequacy of the response; the awful, helpless feeling that there really is no adequate response to an impossibly contagious virus with no effective cure.</p> <p>But one thought, more than any other, troubles Lost in Showbiz. Where are the celebrities in all this? It has long held that in any time of dire crisis, the people we should look to for guidance are the famous ones, selflessly willing to share with us their indispensable thoughts: on what should be done, on how people’s spirits should be lifted. Where, it asks, is Paul Daniels, who <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2011/aug/11/judge-paul-daniels-condemns-looters" title="">gallantly came to Britain’s aid during the 2011 riots with his own inimitable brand of blue-sky thinking</a>, spitballing one idea after another that the nation may be saved further turmoil. Perhaps the rioters should be deported to Afghanistan, he mused. Perhaps we should douse them in petrol and threaten to set them on fire. Perhaps we should chop their hands off. Is there such a thing as a “wide-angle tazer” that could be deployed?</p> <p>Where is Chris Brown, who felt the best way to quell the situation would be for him to play his hit song Beautiful People to the rioters? LiS mourns the loss of the late Michael Winner, who rushed to social media in the wake of the Japanese tsunami to focus the world’s collective mind on the truly important issue: would it affect attendance figures for the American Cinematheque’s Tribute to Michael Winner event at the Aero Theatre Santa Monica? And it asks, where is Nicole Scherzinger, who noted that the 2010 Haiti earthquake may have been bad news for the 316,000 people who died, but that at least there had been one “miracle from Haiti’s disaster”: she’d met a producer at the recording of a charity single and together they’d made a “raw, soulful and funky” Nicole Scherzinger album.</p> <p>These were sage words; comforting words. But where are their equivalents in the face of the most severe public health emergency seen in modern times? The celebrity response started so well, with the appearance of Donald Trump – a man Lost in Showbiz has long come to think of as a lone voice of common sense in a world gone mad – fearlessly pinpointing the real culprits in all of this: the aid workers. “<a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/whoopi-goldberg-to-donald-trump-on-ebola-virus-do-your-homework-201458" title="">The US cannot allow EBOLA infected people back</a>,” he tweeted. “People that go to far-away places to help are great – but must suffer the consequences!” At those words, Lost in Showbiz’s heart skipped a beat: thank Christ, the cavalry are here! It can only be a matter of time before Daniels rocks up with his wide-angle taser and his jerrycan of BP unleaded.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-79fa1a2b-9b34-4cb8-b409-4f48deee1a55"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/9/1412865603794/1b5b874c-1c07-46bc-8e75-60609f28ef71-460x276.jpeg" alt="Kim Kardashian and Kanye West … in danger?" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Kim Kardashian and Kanye West … in danger?</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Sipa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>LiS waited and it waited, but nothing. Its interest was momentarily pricked by a story that Kim Kardashian was “<a href="https://www.dishnation.com/kim-k-terrified-of-ebola-trading-in-her-designer-duds-for-hazmat-chic/" title="">trying to get her hands on a number of impermeable full body suits to protect herself and her family against Ebola</a>”. “These are the sorts of suits companies such as Doctors Without Borders or airport paramedics would be requesting. Not celebrities who don’t want to cut down their air travel,” claimed Lost in Showbiz’s old buddy An Unnamed Source. But the more it read of it – “Kardashian, hubby Kanye West, and their daughter North were most recently in Paris, France, but there’s no telling where the jet-setting family will end up next!”, it concluded, with the implicit suggestion they might all be “jet-setting” to Liberia – the more Lost in Showbiz began to suspect that the whole thing was made up, perhaps on the famous journalistic principle that if you think up the most idiotic thing you possibly can about Kim and Kanye, there’s a 75% chance it might actually happen.</p> <p>Next, Lost in Showbiz became hugely excited about the story that R’n’B star <a href="http://africasacountry.com/the-wisdom-of-akon/" title="">Akon</a> had played a charity concert in the Democratic Republic of the Congo encased in a giant plastic bubble to avoid coming into contact with the virus. It certainly seemed like the kind of thing Akon might do: he has variously told black Americans that they’re “blessed” not to be living in Africa, then changed his mind and told them they should all move to Africa and “live like kings” there and informed one journalist that women should always be monogamous, but men shouldn’t; and told another that there was <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/akon-so-what-if-i-own-a-diamond-mine-436472.html" title="">no such thing as a blood diamond</a> – the whole concept was apparently made up by Hollywood and people believed it. But, alas, no. He did indeed perform in a giant plastic bubble. Apparently he attempted to crowd surf in it but fell to the ground and had to be rescued by the UN – good to see them doing something useful for a change rather than just passing resolutions involving the trade in non-existent blood diamonds – but he also performed outside it.</p> <p>No giant plastic anti-Ebola bubble for Akon, no impermeable full-body suit for Kim: the only thing that celebrities appeared to have done in response to the Ebola outbreak was to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/world/celebrities-team-up-to-fight-ebola/2014/10/08/c68d3c64-4f26-11e4-877c-335b53ffe736_video.html" title="">film a sober video asking for a calm and non-hysterical response</a> to the outbreak and soliciting donations for local relief efforts. Lost in Showbiz could barely contain its fury: a sober back-and-white video soliciting donations for local relief efforts? What’s wrong with doing something genuinely useful, more befitting your status as celebrities? Get a hashtag campaign going! Or something involving posting selfies to Facebook! Will none of you get yourselves on Twitter and start pontificating about the situation like a great berk? Seriously, this amounts to an absolute dereliction of duty. These are desperate times! People are being forced to make up stories about Akon having a giant plastic anti-Ebola bubble, simply because so-called “celebrities” are refusing to behave like celebrities. It’s absolutely terrible.</p> <p>So thank God for Katie Hopkins, who this week tweeted a load of idiotic old cack about how much <a href="https://twitter.com/KTHopkins/status/519759796241592320" title="">she “admired” the Ebola virus</a>. Teary with gratitude that at least someone is behaving in the manner they are supposed to, Lost in Showbiz is now counting down the days until Hopkins has herself deliberately infected with Ebola to prove that only thick, lazy poor people die of it.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/uk-screening-airports-ebola-symptoms <p>Travellers arriving at Heathrow and Gatwick from west Africa are to be screened for symptoms of Ebola, Downing Street announced on Thursday night after a day of confusion over the government’s response to the virus that has claimed more than 3,800 lives.</p> <p>People travelling from the worst-affected countries – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – will face a questionnaire about their recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and their onward travel arrangements.</p> <p>Medical staff will be deployed to check some travellers’ body temperature to ascertain if they have fever, one of the early symptoms of the illness. Rail passengers arriving in Kent and London on the Eurostar from Paris and Brussels will also be screened.</p> <p>Cases have already been reported in Spain and the US, where <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-dallas-deputy-sheriff-hospital-symptoms-death" title="">Thomas Eric Duncan died on Thursday</a> after flying in from Liberia with the disease.</p> <p>Washington has announced that travellers from the worst-hit countries will have their temperatures taken on arrival at five major airports in New York, Washington, Chicago and Atlanta.</p> <p>The UK border measures will be introduced “in the coming days”, Downing Street said, and the announcement came despite the British defence secretary, Michael Fallon, saying earlier on Thursday that airport screening was not in line with World Health Organisation advice that screening for fevers or temperature is better conducted in the exit country.</p> <p>The chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, cited “concern about the growing number of cases” of the illness and recommended border checks to ensure “potential cases arriving in the UK are identified as quickly as possible”.</p> <p>Public Health England staff will work alongside border officers. No 10 was unable to say whether the system would catch travellers from west Africa who had transferred planes in other cities.</p> <p>The apparent U-turn comes before a war game-style test of Britain’s ability to cope with an outbreak being planned by the Department of Health this weekend. Doctors, the ambulance service, local authorities and the police will take part in the real-time simulation of Ebola cases at two or more hospitals to be selected in the north and south of England.</p> <p>No 10 said: “Advice from the chief medical officer today is that enhanced screening arrangements at the UK’s main ports of entry for people travelling from the affected regions – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – will offer an additional level of protection to the UK.</p> <p>“These measures will help to improve our ability to detect and isolate Ebola cases. However, it is important to stress that given the nature of this disease, no system could offer 100% protection from non-symptomatic cases.”</p> <p>The Foreign Office was last night investigating reports that a Briton had died of suspected Ebola in Macedonia. Tests were being carried out but the man’s colleague said he had not been in any country known to have Ebola outbreaks. A social services centre in Paris which was sealed off after four children recently arrived from Guinea showed symptoms of the illness, was later reopened after the French authorities said it was a false alarm.</p> <p>Pressure for airport screening grew yesterday when Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, which scrutinises border controls, called for tests “to ensure that this deadly disease cannot take more lives”. Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, also urged the government to consider passenger screening “without delay”.</p> <p>Davies said: “Rapid access to healthcare services by someone infected with Ebola is not only important for their health but also key to reducing the risk of transmission to others. These measures could include a further UK-based package of measures to identify and assess the health status of passengers arriving from the affected countries and to ensure that those individuals know what to do should they be taken ill whilst in the UK.”</p> <p>Experts say airport screening may have limited effect. David Heymann, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who is also chairman of Public Health England, said there was a danger of creating a false sense of security .</p> <p>“It is not a failsafe method mainly because people cross [borders] while they are still in the incubation period and you don’t know they are infected,” he said.</p> <p>“The most important response is better detection and rapid response. Borders cannot stop infectious diseases spreading. In Hong Kong and Singapore they set up thermal scanners during the Sars epidemic but I don’t think they identified more than one case that way.”</p> <p>Professor David Mabey, another physician specialising in infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, warned passengers will lie about their travel history to avoid the inconvenience and so would be “a waste of time”.</p> <p>“If last week your aunt died of Ebola but you feel fine, are you going to be honest when you get to the airport and risk being detained?” he said.</p> <p>Professor George Griffin, chairman of the advisory committee on dangerous pathogens, said screening just for body temperature was ineffectual and would have missed the case of the US death.</p> <p>Experts also moved to play down fears of a major UK outbreak. Peter Piot, a Belgian microbiologist who is part of the World Health Organisation’s Ebola science group, said: “I’m not concerned about an outbreak in western Europe, in the UK, like we are seeing in west Africa.”</p> <p>Heymann said British preparedness to cope with Ebola cases was “superb”.</p> <p>“The government and the NHS has access to all clinicians so messages can get out to all of them at once and that means it is much easier to achieve uniformity than in private systems,” he said.</p> <p>He added that the public health authorities in the UK has successfully stopped two outbreaks of the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome, a virus which, unlike Ebola, can be transmitted through the air.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/ebola-outbreak-six-quarantined-in-spain-madrid-hospital-ramos <p>The condition of Teresa Romero Ramos – the Spanish nurse who is the first known person to contract Ebola outside west Africa – has worsened, according to relatives.</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon, her brother José Ramón Romero told reporters at the Carlos III hospital that her state had deteriorated and she was now intubated. In a television interview with La Sexta he said she was having lung problems.</p> <p>Four more people have been put in quarantine in the Carlos III hospital in the past day, bringing the total to seven. Another 80 or so are under observation, including health workers who treated Romero Ramos, and two employees at the hair salon where the nurse went for an appointment a week and a half ago.</p> <p>Her husband, who has not shown any symptoms, remains in isolation as a precautionary measure.</p> <p>On Wednesday the nurse gave several phone interviews to Spanish media outlets, sounding exhausted as she offered answers that ranged from monosyllabic to a 12-minute conversation. The doctor attending to her told reporters that he had spoken to her in an effort to retrace her steps as part of the investigation into how she contracted the disease.</p> <p>The doctor, Germán Ramírez, said the nurse believed she might have touched her face with her gloves as she was taking off her protective equipment after attending to the second Ebola patient repatriated to Spain. Later in an interview with the Spanish television network Cuatro, the nurse said her training in how to get into and out of the suit had lasted “a short time”.</p> <p>On Thursday more details emerged regarding the handling of Romero Ramos’s case, reinforcing health workers’ claims that this was an improvised response, lacking in top-down guidance.</p> <p>One of the doctors who treated the nurse when she arrived at the hospital in Alcorcón on Monday described the 16 hours he spent treating the nurse in a report to his superiors. Published by several media outlets in Spain, the report said the team treating Romero Ramos initially wore impermeable gowns, double gloves, hats and masks to protect themselves.</p> <p>As the nurse’s state worsened, the health workers changed into more protective clothing. The patient was suffering from diarrhoea, vomiting and coughing, the doctor said. His protective equipment was ill-fitting. “At all times the sleeves were too short,” he wrote, leaving his skin exposed.</p> <p>Despite being on the frontline of treating the nurse, he was not updated when her test results proved positive, he said. “I learned of the results from journalists rather than the relevant authority.” The doctor is now one of the seven people in quarantine.</p> <p>Other lapses emerged, including the fact that the ambulance that initially brought Romero Ramos from her home to the Alcorcón hospital carried seven other patients after her before it was sterilised.</p> <p>Speaking to journalists at a conference on youth employment in Milan on Wednesday, the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, said European colleagues thought Spain was managing the Ebola case “very well”.</p> <p>At a conference that included the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, François Hollande, Rajoy said many leaders had expressed interest in what was happening in Spain. “My colleagues are telling me that we’re doing things very well,” he assured the journalists.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2014/oct/09/ftse-lowest-for-year-economy-ebola <p>On 10 October 2013, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> was sitting at 6430, before subsequently rising - albeit in a rather volatile way - to its recent peak of 6878 in May.</p><p>Now a year later the leading index has fallen all the way back, closing down 50.39 points at 6431.85.</p><p>It did not look like that at the start of the day, with markets enthused by the US Federal Reserve minutes which suggested fears of an early interest rate rise were misplaced.</p><p>But this optimism soon faded, as the current worries about global growth and geopolitical concerns reasserted themselves.</p><p>This week has seen a raft of poor data, from Germany in particular, and a 5.8% fall in exports reinforced fears about a possible recession in what is supposed to be the eurozone's powerhouse. Coming in the wake of the IMF cutting its global growth forecasts, that brought the sellers out once more. Comments from Chancellor George Osborne that the eurozone weakness was already hitting the UK economy also dented sentiment.</p><p>Added to that, was the continuing concern about air strikes on Isis, the situation in Ukraine and of course the spread of the Ebola virus.</p><p>The market falls accelerated as Wall Street opened, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 180 points by the time London closed.</p><p>A number of UK companies went ex-dividend including Kingfisher, which fell 15.9p to 296.8p, and Aviva, down 499.3p.</p><p>Among the other fallers, <strong>Vodafone</strong> fell 6.95p to 197.35 as Nomura, highlighting competition worries, cut its target price to 180p from 190p and moved to reduce from neutral. Meanwhile Espirito Santo's Andrew Hogley issued a sell note at the prospect Vodafone might overpay for Italian broadband firm Fastweb, said to have been put up for sale by owner Swisscom.</p><p>Worries about the impact of Ebola on travel and tourism saw <strong>easyJet</strong> lose another 37p to £13.41 while <strong>Tui Travel</strong> fell 10.1p to 356.9p.</p><p>Oil fell back once more, with Brent crude currently down 1.4% at $90.1 a barrel, on oversupply and the prospect of falling demand, given global economic weakness.</p><p>However metal prices moved higher as the dollar weakened following the suggestion the Fed would not raise rates prematurely. So Mexican precious metals miner <strong>Fresnillo</strong> was up 46.5p to 770p and <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> rose 248p to £42.98. Numis said:</p><p><blockquote>We stick with our defensive criteria; our [mining] picks remain Randgold, Fresnillo and Petra which have superior growth profiles to counter-act flat to falling commodity prices, high quality assets to weather any downturn and strong management to deliver on business plans.<br /></blockquote></p><p></p><p><strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rose 64p to £30.53 as Credit Suisse suggested <strong>Glencore</strong>, down 4.9p at 321.75p, could come back for another tilt at the iron ore specialist when it was allowed in six months time. Analyst Liam Fitzpatrick said:</p><p><blockquote>[After] Glencore's announcement that it was not actively considering a merger or offer [it] is now for the next six months subject to Rule 2.8 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (no offer without the consent of the Takeover Panel). However, this far from rules out a bid further down the line, in our view.<br /><br />There have been a number of unsuccessful deals in recent years (BHP/Rio, Vale/Xstrata, Xstrata/Anglo American) and...there are major obstacles to a deal not least of which is the polar opposite company cultures and buy in from major Rio shareholders (Chinalco, Ltd shareholders). However, big deals typically occur at the peak or trough of the cycle and the synergies on offer together with the potential to re-rate Rio through diversification could become all the more compelling if iron ore continues to move lower in 2015/16. Glencore may therefore be happy to play the waiting game but we expect the prospect of a second approach to remain an overhang.<br /></blockquote></p><p>Back among the losers <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> - owner of British Sugar as well as the more high profile Primark - fell 12p to £25.53 after Germany's Suedzucker said the European sugar and ethanol markets had continued to deteriorate.</p><p>Among the mid-caps, <strong>Hays</strong> was 2.7p higher at 122.7p after the recruitment group reported an underlying 9% rise in first quarter fees, following strong demand in the UK, Australia and Germany.</p><p>Lower down the market <strong>New British Palm Oil</strong> was in demand after it received a £1.073bn or 715p a share offer from Malaysian plantation owner Sime Darby. Sime Darby director Anthony Dass said:</p><p><blockquote>As a brown field asset, New British Palm Oil will immediately contribute to earnings without the incumbent risks associated with green field expansion.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>The move comes just days after Sime Darby said it would not by the 49% stake in New British Palm Oil owned by Malaysian investment firm Kulim.</p><p>The company, which has land holdings in Papua New Guinea, said it would recommend the bid, and Kulim said it would accept it, unless a higher offer came in.</p><p>New British Palm Oil jumped 286p or 74% to 670p while fellow producer <strong>M P Evans</strong> also benefited, up 7% to 457.625p. Analyst Charles Hall at Peel Hunt said:</p><p><blockquote>Only 10 days after stating that it had decided not to proceed with an offer for Kulim's shares, Sime Darby has now announced a cash offer at 715p (an 85% premium) for the entire company. Assuming Kulim agrees and given approval from the Papua New Guinea government, this deal should go through. The size of premium reflects the long term prospects for palm oil rather than the current weakness in the palm oil price. It also continues the theme of consolidation in the industry and demonstrates the value in MP Evans.<br /><br />It appears that the termination of the talks with Kulim (who own 49%) was more due to time constraints rather than desire to proceed. Post the termination, New Britain's management was able to be involved and to help secure the necessary agreements.<br /><br />This deal values New Britain at $28,000 per mature hectare and $25,000 including immature hectares, though this does include the downstream and sugar assets. This looks an attractive price given the current palm price, at which level New Britain is moderately profitable. The price demonstrates the long term value in plantation assets rather than the short term issues. It also demonstrates the value in MP Evans, which is trading on c$10,000 per hectare. We expect consolidation in the industry to continue given the increasing difficulty of finding new land.</blockquote></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/family-ebola-victim-dallas-eric-duncan <p>It had been planned as a vigil, but the service quickly turned into a memorial once the news broke that Ebola had killed Eric Duncan, the virus’s first victim in the US.</p> <p>Before his condition worsened and he died in a Dallas hospital at 7.51am local time on Wednesday, eight days after his diagnosis was confirmed, Duncan’s last words were spoken to a nurse from the bed in his isolation room: a request to see Karsiah, the son he last saw 16 years ago when the boy was three.</p> <p>That final hope went unfulfilled. A student in San Angelo, 250 miles away, Karsiah was staying in Dallas and preparing to head to Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in the hope of seeing Duncan at about 9am when his mother called him to tell him his father had died.</p> <p>The sense of disconnection and distance, even from relatives in the same city, was replicated at Wilshere Baptist church on Wednesday evening at a service that was mainly for Duncan’s close friends and family, but necessarily took place without them.</p> <p>If the virus no longer seems abstract and exotic but real and local for worried Dallasites,, for those nearest to Duncan their brush with Ebola has had a distancing effect, segregating them from each other and the wider community. Some barriers are temporary, but others will linger as the consequences of the 42-year-old’s decision to leave Liberia for Texas to start afresh with the woman he loved and a son he hardly knew.</p> <p>After Duncan became seriously ill at her apartment last week, Louise Troh, her 13-year-old son and two nephews were quarantined at a house somewhere in the Dallas area. They will remain there until around 19 October, when the 21-day incubation period for Ebola will be over. It meant they could not be among the 150 or so in the pews who sang hymns, listened to Bible readings, prayed and held candles that flickered, throwing dancing shadows on to the church walls.</p> <p>It was here that Troh was baptised last June, about eight months after she was introduced to the congregation by three nieces, and where she went to Bible study classes on Sunday mornings. The pastor, George Mason, and Clay Jenkins, a local judge, travelled to her temporary accommodation to tell the family about Duncan’s death, staying for several hours.</p> <p>The house has a common kitchen, living room and eating area but the occupants sleep in separate bedrooms. Mason and Jenkins gathered them together but they were forced to grieve apart, unwilling to risk hugging each other in case one of them is carrying the virus.</p> <p>“One of the most painful things in this process has been because of their isolation. They’ve not only been moved from everyone else, they are even supposed to keep away from each other in the house,” Mason said after the service.</p> <p>“The human instinct is to want to rush towards each other in moments like these and to touch each other and hold each other, to comfort each other … it was the most unnatural-feeling thing, as you might imagine.”</p> <p>During the ceremony, which was streamed live online, Mason described Duncan as a kind, respectful man who, Troh told him, “knew how to talk to ladies, he didn’t let anyone use bad language around women”. He said they planned to build a family together in the US and that he wanted to work hard and save up enough money for them to return to Liberia one day.</p> <p>Mason said Duncan’s spoke his last words around Friday, shortly before he became unresponsive and his condition was deteriorated.</p> <p>Troh and Duncan reportedly met at a refugee camp in Ivory Coast after fleeing war in Liberia, and she left for the US with Karsiah once they had secured visas. When Karsiah found out that his father had passed away, Mason said, it was “an eruption of grief”. He had hoped Duncan would be able to attend his high school graduation.</p> <p>Troh, a 54-year-old nursing assistant, issued a statement on Wednesday that said: “I trust a thorough examination will take place regarding all aspects of his care … I am now dealing with the sorrow and anger that his son was not able to see him before he died.”</p> <p>That appeared to be a reference to frustration at the hospital’s initial failure to diagnose him correctly, and a delay of several days before they treated him with experimental drugs. Mason said that Duncan’s deterioration and death took relatives by surprise, because they had put their faith in the new course of treatment.</p> <p>“This was part of the shock to the family, because the announcement that he was at long last receiving some sort of treatment protocol was an explosion of joy for them. When I was able to tell them that, [Troh] just sort of did a high-pitched scream, ‘glory to God, glory to God’. She left the phone for a second, I think she might have been dancing around,” Mason said.</p> <p>“She was very excited thinking her prayers were being answered and maybe this was just what they’d been praying for and hoping for. Honestly from the point of view of the family and the boys who were in quarantine there was now a great sense of hopefulness for the first time because up till now they were very frustrated by the lack of treatment available to him.”</p> <p>He downplayed <a href="http://www.wfaa.com/story/news/health/2014/10/08/ebola-jesse-jackson-dallas-tx-patient/16889201/" title="">suggestions that the family were angry at the hospital and believe Duncan’s care was inadequate compared with the treatment of other Ebola patients in the US</a>.</p> <p>“When people are in a situation like this they hear about others, they compare and they wonder. They don’t have all the information necessary to evaluate whether this is the same kind of situation or different. It only feels like the same to them. They can’t evaluate what differences might be and so it immediately makes your imagination go to, who was at fault here that he didn’t get that sort of thing? Those are natural human reactions and they’re not meant to be accusations, only frustrations of misunderstanding,” he said.</p> <p>With Troh confined to the house there is no funeral currently planned, but there may eventually be a service to bury Duncan’s ashes, Mason said. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/guidance-safe-handling-human-remains-ebola-patients-us-hospitals-mortuaries.html" title="">Federal guidelines call for the remains of Ebola victims to be cremated</a>.</p> <p>Even after they are deemed not to be contagious, there is a risk the family will be treated as pariahs in the city. Mason said it would be impossible for them to return to their former apartment complex and that private donors have already stepped up to help find them a place to live and pay for their rent, furnishings and other expenses. The family had craved a new start – but not like this, not without the man who was supposed to be at the heart of it.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/09/ebola-sierra-leone <p><strong>Reports and presenters:</strong> <strong>LO’C</strong> Lisa O’Carroll; <strong>MM</strong> Monica Mark; <strong>HM</strong> Hugh Muir</p> <p><strong>Interviewees:</strong> <strong>EBK</strong> Ernest Bai Koroma; <strong>PP</strong> Professor Peter Piot; <strong>RP</strong> Robtel Pailey; <strong>MY</strong> Dr Mohammed Yilla; <strong>RM</strong> Roeland Monasch; <strong>MC</strong> Matthew Clark; <strong>TD</strong> Tom Dannatt</p> <p><strong>LO’C</strong> The first time I went to Sierra Leone a little over a year ago I was really hit by the extreme poverty of the country, lack of running water, lack of electricity, I know that’s a common feature in sub-Saharan Africa, but what was also extremely interesting was the overwhelming sense of optimism in the country, that this was a country 10 or 11 years after a civil war that was finally getting back on its feet. Things were moving and progressing in the right direction, foreign investment was returning, mines were opening and there were even green shoots of tourism with those wonderful, wonderful beaches on the western coast.</p> <p>So anyway, that was my first and only time in Sierra Leone and little did I know that a year or so later I was going to be inundated with emails from people I’d interviewed begging me to bring attention to the Ebola outbreak. So when I spoke to the director of operations at Médecins sans Frontières at the beginning of August and he told me that the world’s response was completely inadequate, I understood where he was coming from. Sierra Leone is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world, dependent on foreign aid, despite having natural resources such as diamonds and rare minerals.</p> <p>There’s been lots in the media about the crisis, there’s been hysterical reporting in the US about the threat to their own citizens, there’s been plenty of debate in the media, at the UN, about how to achieve the beginning of the end and how to contain the crisis, including the efficacy of a lockdown in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Here’s the president of Sierra Leone, Ernest Bai Koroma, just before the lockdown began in September.</p> <p><strong>EBK</strong> Médecins Sans Frontières, they may be right in what they’re saying, but they’re only talking about it from the curative point of view, looking after the sick, they are caregivers. What we are more concerned about is the social mobilisation, 0.02% of the population, that is about just 1,000 people who have been affected by this, we still have five million, 999,000 people who have not been affected. These are the emergency, these are the ones that we must keep safe.</p> <p><strong>LO’C</strong> The number of dead had surpassed 3,000 at the start of October, more than the combined death toll of all previous outbreaks since 1976. Many are calling for more and more resources to be thrown at the crisis, like professor Peter Piot.</p> <p><strong>PP</strong> From my perspective what can we do, this is an enormously complicated logistics job and frankly the military are, together with DHL and so, are very good to do this. And then in addition …</p> <p><strong>LO’C</strong> With DHL did you say?</p> <p><strong>PP</strong> Yes, I mean all these companies that are into logistics and transport and delivery, I think they would be extremely useful but we also need doctors and so on and I think that the NHS and universities just coming back to the UK, we should make it possible for nurses and doctors who want to do this to volunteer and to work in an organised way through, for example, MSF and so on, I mean you need a structure there to work in.</p> <p><strong>LO’C</strong> But behind the headlines what is happening in Sierra Leone and neighbouring Liberia?</p> <p><strong>RP</strong> My name is Robtel Pailey, I’m Liberian, I’m a PhD candidate at the University of London School of Oriental and African Studies. I think there’s a lot of anxiety, a bit of hysteria because they don’t know what the next day holds. I remember having a conversation with my aunt when I was in Liberia in July and the question she asked me when we were sort of sitting at home trying to figure out what was going on was she was there during the course of the war and they dodged bullets from one county to another, from one city to another, now at this stage something like Ebola is going to kill them and she couldn’t understand how it could get to this level.</p> <p>But at least during the war you could see the moving targets, you could see the bullets, you could see where the destruction and where the possible danger was coming from. At this stage no one knows, and I think that level of uncertainty is what makes the situation so intense.</p> <p>I’m in touch with my family almost every single day and they’re trying to stay calm, they’re trying to stay prayerful and I think that’s pretty much what they’re holding on to, is this impeccable faith in God that at some point their prayers will be answered and this thing will go away.</p> <p><strong>LO’C </strong>For all the progress that has been made in West Africa what weaknesses has Ebola exposed in the development of countries like Sierra Leone and Liberia? How far will the disease hit the fragile and underfunded healthcare system?</p> <p>With civil war a recent memory how much trust do citizens have for national government and the West, and can anything come from the media’s renewed focus on the region?</p> <p>I’m Lisa O’Carroll, this is the Global Development podcast, stay with us.</p> <p>Let’s start with health and this report by Monica Mark who has recently been meeting doctors in Sierra Leone.</p> <p><strong>MM</strong> On the coast of west Africa Sierra Leone has suffered the second highest number of fatalities in the Ebola outbreak. By the end of September some 600 people had died out of the total of just over 3,000 recorded deaths across Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, but a recent quarantine here revealed dozens of undetected cases and health officials say the numbers may well have been underestimated all along.</p> <p>Although Ebola is deadly and contagious it’s also actually easily containable and so to understand how it’s been able to spread so far in Sierra Leone I spoke to Mohammed Yilla, a doctor in Freetown who runs a maternal health programme.</p> <p>Maternal and neonatal health statistics are a good beacon to gauge a country’s overall health system. Sierra Leone languishes at the bottom of every index for both maternal and neonatal health.</p> <p><strong>MY</strong> Before the Ebola crisis there have been challenges around making sure health facilities had the right stuff, for instance like a midwife. We’re not talking hi-tech, we’re not talking even doctors, we’re talking about nurses, we’re talking about midwives. The health facilities that did not have midwives, that did not have nurses, the health facilities that did not have drugs and in a country where water is so available many health facilities had very, very poor infrastructure relating to water availability and sanitation. And worse still, even electricity.</p> <p>So I think when we talk about that we’re talking about a country that probably haven’t turned around the issue of the civil war, a country that is faced with a very fragile health system.</p> <p><strong>MM</strong> Almost have of Sierra Leone’s population of six million is under the age of 18. I asked Roeland Monasch, country director of Unicef, what impact the outbreak is having on the country’s children.</p> <p><strong>RM</strong> It’s going up again. The impact on children is dramatic because the symptoms for Ebola, the first symptoms are very similar to preventable diseases like malaria, diarrhoea, and as a result of that because of the fear and anxiety parents are not taking their children anymore to a clinic. Well, we as Unicef have worked so hard to get anti malarias, anti diarrhoeas, pneumonia medicines to all clinics; we distribute to all 1,200 clinics, we supply them with medicines.</p> <p><strong>MM</strong> And unfortunately that impact goes far beyond the health sector.</p> <p><strong>RM</strong> Kids are not going to school so they’re missing their education at a very important phase in their lives, but secondly these schools are also a safe and protective environment for them, they’re overrun but it’s in the school compound and people are looking at them, now all these kids are out in communities which are all on high alert and anxiety so protection issues are there as well, child labour issues, so it’s not good, it’s very bad actually.</p> <p><strong>MM</strong> But even if schools do reopen and the outbreak slows down it’s likely to take a long time before Sierra Leone recovers completely.</p> <p><strong>RM</strong> The health system will take some more time I think, also people need to, and that’s also part of the work on social mobilisation we’re doing, people need to trust the system again, sort of confidence in the fact that they can go to a clinic. That might take a bit longer.</p> <p><strong>LO’C</strong> That was Roeland Monasch, country director for Unicef. So what are the long-term solutions for healthcare? Matthew Clark is the director of the Wellbodi Partnership in Sierra Leone. He spoke to the Guardian’s Hugh Muir.</p> <p><strong>MC</strong> Well I think that the solutions are complex and part of a very kind of chronic problem with the healthcare system, and I think that it takes a long time to train doctors, to train nurses, and build up a functioning healthcare system. And I think in Sierra Leone you have a good medical school that produces young doctors and you have several good nursing schools that produce good nurses, the challenge is that these healthcare professionals leave and qualify into a fairly dysfunctional system where there isn’t any senior doctors, senior nurses to support them, or there are very few because those people tend to have left, either during the war or to seek better professional opportunities overseas.</p> <p>So you have these very junior, very enthusiastic, very committed people start to work in a system that doesn’t function, they’ve got no one to refer to for advice, they’ve got no support. For themselves if they want to progress in their career they up until now have had to leave the country to seek specialist training.</p> <p>So I think until you build up a system where young doctors and nurses can qualify in Sierra Leone, can see an opportunity and a future for themselves and that the system supports them and nurtures them to become the kind of health leaders that they need to be, whether that’s in oncology, paediatrics, special psychiatry, it doesn’t really matter what speciality they’re doing, what you need is a system where people can leave medical school, leave nursing school and establish themselves as the senior doctors.</p> <p><strong>HM</strong> Presumably when people get to that stage they then start looking abroad because they can take themselves abroad and they can do well?</p> <p><strong>MC</strong> Exactly, and I think even before they get to that stage to actually get that training and that sort of experience, it’s almost impossible to get that in Sierra Leone, so very early on in their career they start to look, either within the west African sub-region or further afield and then, of course, like everyone else the incentives to come back to Sierra Leone at the time when they’d be most effective, which is probably in their mid-30s to mid-40s, then they have families and children and it’s very difficult then to suddenly relocate your life back to Sierra Leone.</p> <p>So I think until we address that central problem of not just thinking about we’ve got 20 doctors, 100 doctors in the country, but actually what are we doing with those doctors and how we can turn them into the leaders of the future it’s going to be very difficult to tackle any of these problems whatever the disease.</p> <p><strong>HM</strong> So that’s a problem that’s bigger than the health service in a way because to create the conditions so they would want to stay, that’s about the conditions in the country, that’s about the stability of the country isn’t it?</p> <p><strong>MC</strong> I think in part, but I don’t necessarily accept that it’s just about that, there will be some people who want to leave because of the system at large and there are some people who want to leave purely for professional reasons. And so I think you’re right, to create a utopia where every young doctor just wants to stay in Sierra Leone because it’s perfect I agree is a big challenge, but actually I don’t think it’s beyond the kind of commitment of the international community and other partners to actually say we’re going to look at this as a 10-year problem and we’re going to think about how do we strengthen the healthcare system over ten years, what expertise and what resources do we need to put in place to make sure that these young healthcare workers can train and be supported and then be remunerated appropriately.</p> <p><strong>LO’C </strong>That was Matthew Clark. We’ll be back straight after this.</p> <p>[advertisement break]</p> <p>You’re listening to the Global Development podcast, I’m Lisa O’Carroll. When you ask professionals working in Sierra Leone and Liberia what is causing the most problems they often cite lack of resources, ranging from lack of protective clothing or supplies of basics like paracetamol, ambulances, even open hospitals, but an underlying issue also identified early on is the lack of trust in authorities, a hangover from the civil war.</p> <p>We heard earlier from Robtel Pailey about the resonance the Ebola crisis has for those who lived through recent wars. Before we hear from her again this is Tom Dannatt, founder and director of the British charity, StreetChild, who work exclusively in Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p> <p><strong>TD</strong> Sierra Leone is a very suspicious society, the story is that the father tells the son to sit on a wall and turn his back to him. “I’ll stand behind you and just when you’re ready just rock back and I’ll catch you.” And the son does as his father tells him to and the father lets the son fall to the ground and hurt himself. And the son gets up and says, “Why did you do that, Dad?” And the dad says, “I’m teaching you the most important thing you’ll ever learn about life in Sierra Leone: trust nobody.”</p> <p>This is something I carry around with me and I see it in my regular life in Sierra Leone, trust is the commodity which is really at its lowest, the lack of trust which creates a vacuum through which rumour swirls and it makes it so hard for positive information to gain traction and it makes it very hard for businesses to operate, or even simple petty commerce on a local level.</p> <p><strong>RP</strong> I think a lot of investors are pulling out, or at least coming to a standstill. There have been issues with possible GDP growth slowing, I mean I remember AFD, the African Development Bank was saying that GDP growth this year was estimated at maybe 6% would probably go down to 3% for Liberia. I don’t remember what the estimates are for Sierra Leone.</p> <p><strong>TD</strong> For myself the problem that’s been really exposed is the chronic lack of education, under education of the population, particularly in the rural areas. We know that at least a quarter of a million children of primary school going age in Sierra Leone don’t go to school and that number, it’s nearer half a million in Liberia. As this disease has emerged it has spread predominantly in rural areas. These are the areas which are the hardest for the public health messages to penetrate.</p> <p><strong>RP</strong> I think in terms of the education system, I mean a few months ago the President said that the education system was in a mess which is a very damning evidence of her administration in terms of what it’s invested in in the education sector. Almost more than half of the entrants, the students who took the University of Liberia entrance exam, failed both the math and the English section.</p> <p>In terms of people’s morale, I think I’m more concerned about that than the infrastructure or the economic aspects, but people had a sense of hope I think immediately after the war ended, I think there’s a lot of despair and disillusionment at this stage. Even before Ebola I would say became a national health emergency, or international health emergency as the WHO says it is, I think people were suffering even before this Ebola outbreak came in and I think now that the prices of commodities have gone up people’s livelihoods are being threatened, they’re staying at home but again they don’t know what tomorrow holds, so it’s just a really trying time for the country.</p> <p><strong>TD</strong> Those that have received the least by way of services are those who are going to be the most sceptical and untrusting of messages that come from those that purport to serve them.</p> <p><strong>RP</strong> I think at the back of most people’s minds is yes, we’re still disillusioned, yes we’re still angry, but the fact of the matter is, we’re in the moment now, we have to deal with this now. But those questions of is the government really interested in my best interest are not going to go away, but right now I think it’s trust under duress if that makes any sense.</p> <p><strong>TD</strong> I think if we look specifically at what happened in West Point when overnight West Point was quarantined in an unexpected and aggressive fashion led by Liberian military and armed security forces, certain civilians, including one of our own beneficiaries were shot. Titus was shot by security forces. He turned up in our office in Monrovia heavily bleeding having tried to admit himself to two hospitals and being turned away. Our staff then helped him to be admitted to a third one.</p> <p><strong>RP</strong> I think that was a misstep from the very beginning, getting the armed forces of Liberia involved, you know, the government responded by saying that they’re going to have an internal probe and they will investigate the matter and if there’s anyone culpable they will find the culprit and he or she will be penalised.</p> <p><strong>TD</strong> It’s an indication of how potentially explosive this incident was viewed by the political authorities. We’ve had I believe two personal visits from the president of Liberia and they handed over some cash, I think $1,000 (£617). He’s saying he wants to be taken outside Liberia for proper medical care.</p> <p><strong>RP</strong> But I think using lethal force and using the armed forces, without any warning whatsoever I think was a really big misstep on the government’s part. And you know, the President, she’s sort of come back and said she apologised for the use of the AFL and realised that that was not the best course of action and I have to respect her for that, I think a leader who makes a mistake and is able to apologise and to acknowledge that that was a misstep is good I think in this particular instance, and sort of doubling back and saying okay what can we do to make the situation better.</p> <p>They lifted the quarantine on Dolo Town, they lifted the quarantine on West Point because they realised that that wasn’t helping the situation in any way because people didn’t have food to eat, they were scared that they couldn’t leave. The military was knocking on their doors and that just created more hysteria.</p> <p><strong>TD</strong> I think the sheer sort of desperation of the situation has forced the political authorities and everyone to think what can be done. Personally I think only really in recent weeks can I put my hand on my heart and say that I feel that the international response has started to be driven by a concern for West Africans.</p> <p><strong>RP</strong> People on the ground in Liberia are demanding that the $5m or $12m that’s been allotted to the Ebola Taskforce to contain the disease is not being managed properly. Now the National Taskforce leader, Dobo Jalla, came to I think a press conference at the end of August and he had an expenditures report and he was sort of telling us how the money had been expended and there were all these questions about where’s the money gone, they’ve eaten the money. No, that’s now what it’s been used for. And even the finance minister had to come and have another press conference to assure people that the money has not disappeared. And I thought that that was a great step, that they actually were being accountable to the citizenry and coming forward and saying this is how the money’s being spent, even though questions are still being raised.</p> <p>But I think for me a more telling accountability mechanism would also be for the international community to do the same thing. I mean we’re hearing pledges every day of these huge amounts of money but the question that I have as a Liberian citizen is how do we track this amount, I mean where is it going? How is it being used? Is it going on really expensive consultants, or is it going for much needed lifesaving medicine for the Liberian, Sierra Leonean, Guinean and Nigerian people. So I think there also need to be accountability mechanisms for donors as well so that they answer to their stakeholders as well as the people that they say they’re fighting this war on Ebola for.</p> <p><strong>TD</strong> I think a general concern for public hygiene might be a silver lining from this whole episode, people are washing their hands like never before across Liberia and Sierra Leone which is one of the ways or protecting oneself against Ebola but is also a good way of protecting yourself against a variety of other things. Long term the need to transform health provision is there, it’s clear, I hope that the need to transform education provision, people realise that these aren’t just bad things for those people but actually it presents a threat to everyone.</p> <p><strong>RP</strong> There’s a report that said more than 50% of the people who are contracting Ebola are women because they’re the natural care givers in homes. Where people are still, even though they know there’s eminent threat, that they’re still coming to the rescue of their fellow citizens, for me post-Ebola we need to sing these people’s praises and we need to tell their stories. I think that’s so important.</p> <p><strong>LO’C</strong> Matthew Clark again.</p> <p><strong>MC</strong> I think there is as I said a tremendous opportunity while we’re focused on what has caused Ebola to actually try and tackle some of the underlying problems and I think at the minute we’re sort of in a humanitarian phase of the response to Ebola, so that’s a lot about just going in and doing things, trying to treat patients, trying to isolate patients, trying to get the Ebola epidemic under control.</p> <p>I think that there’s a tension always between the humanitarian emergency response and the kind of more sustainable development response where you’re trying to strengthen the healthcare system for the future. And I think historically the international community hasn’t been very good at that, they’ve been good at the kind of big bang response which is effective at dealing with the humanitarian crisis but to a certain extent distorts the underlying health economy and then making sure that we transition from that back to a sustainable path for development. If we can get that transition right I think it’s an incredible opportunity to actually really strengthen the healthcare systems across West Africa and actually move forward the progress that we need.</p> <p><strong>LO’C</strong> And that brings us to the end of this edition of the Global Development podcast.

http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/09/ebola-rayo-vallecano-lass-bangoura-guinea <p>The Rayo Vallecano forward Lass Bangoura has returned to Spain over fears he could catch the Ebola virus while on international duty with Guinea.</p> <p>Guinea are playing their Africa Cup of Nations home qualifier against Ghana in Morocco due to the outbreak, but Bangoura reportedly withdrew from the squad over concerns about being in contact with Guinea-based staff and officials.</p> <p>He has now returned to Madrid – where a nurse this week became the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/ebola-outbreak-six-quarantined-in-spain-madrid-hospital-ramos" title="">first person in Europe to be diagnosed with the disease</a>. Spanish authorities now have seven people in quarantine and another 84 under observation.</p> <p><a href="http://www.espnfc.com/rayo-vallecano/story/2078981/lass-bangoura-returns-to-rayo-vallecano-from-guinea-duty-due-to-ebola-fears" title="">ESPN quoted the player as telling local media</a>: “In Morocco I was there with my teammates. We were not talking about Ebola, just about football and the game against Ghana. I was not concerned about the people coming from Guinea, I was just there with the group. If you have a fever, or something else, you do not come with the national team … [But] I came back as I did not want problems with Rayo, and so that my teammates would trust in me.”</p> <p>Bangoura added: “I do not know if people in Guinea will understand why I left my national team to go back with my club. I am a bit worried for my family [in Guinea], because I might be attacked for this. I must talk with them to see what is happening.”</p> <p>Gabon, meanwhile, have <a href="http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2014/10/09/primera/1412857820_512101.html" title="">reportedly rejected a request from Celta Vigo</a> to release their midfielder Levy Madinda from international duty for the same reason.</p> <p>Celta Vigo’s president, Carlos Mouriño, said: “The club made contact with the FA to discuss the possibility of Levy returning to Vigo, but they have told us that it will not be possible.”</p> <p>Gabon are playing qualifiers against Burkina Faso at home in Libreville on Saturday and away in Ouagadougou on Wednesday.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/09/ebola-infectious-disease-sustainability-concern-sxsw-eco-austin <p>When Ebola broke out in Liberia, 10,000 employees of Aecom Technology Corporation moved out of the country. Their work on new rail infrastructure and public housing in the nation of four million ground to a standstill. Many others <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/15/mining-ebola-africa-nigeria-liberia-guinea-riotinto-vale">have done likewise</a>. As horrific as Ebola has proven to be, the risk of disease across the world’s tropical zone is often <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/08/world-bank-warns-ebola-economic-impact-west-africa">considered alongside questions of resource availability, infrastructure conditions to move goods and services</a>, and political stability as businesses scout new overseas locations.</p> <p>It’s something that companies operating in the global north – including the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida – need to start planning around, according to Gary Lawrence, Aecom’s vice president and chief sustainability officer. In fact, the public-health challenges of so many converging global threats are so daunting that addressing them will take much more dialogue and collaboration across sectors than is currently happening.</p> <p>Addressing an audience gathered Tuesday at the <a href="http://sxsweco.com/">SXSW Eco</a> conference in Austin, Texas, Lawrence said: “Communicable disease is one of the major risks all of us face when we’re thinking about these questions of water, food, energy.” </p> <h2>Deadly diseases are Disney’s problem, too</h2>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="97dcc7c58972fabbf85d074ccce2874d13c3b7a1"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412781163264/360eb79a-3223-4bcf-91f7-c1e5e1d8d056-460x276.jpeg" alt="panelist at sxsw eco 2014" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">‘We don’t normally talk about that as an engineering firm, but it is going to be a problem in terms of how you actually create an outdoor environment that protects people from this disease,’ Gary Lawrence, Aecom’s chief sustainability officer, said to a panel at SXSW Eco. </span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Greg Harman/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lawrence told the SXSW audience that he recently had to warn the leadership of Disney that they must prepare against the possible threat of dengue fever, which has seen <a href="http://miami.cbslocal.com/2014/08/29/new-dengue-fever-cases-reported-in-miami-dade/">a recent outbreak in Florida</a>.</p> <p>“Disney World requires customers to be outside in order to make a profit,” Lawrence said. “How is Disney going to manage the risks of dengue if dengue moves that far up the panhandle and makes it almost impossible for anybody to go outside at dawn or dusk when the mosquitos are active? … There is no greater financial risk to Disney in Orlando than not having people able to come because of an infectious disease problem.</p> <p>“We don’t normally talk about that as an engineering firm, but it is going to be a problem in terms of how you actually create an outdoor environment that protects people from this disease.”</p> <p>Thanks to the increase in temperatures, in part due to global warming, mosquito-borne malaria, dengue fever, and West Nile virus are <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/health/climate/disease.asp">already marching north</a>. The same is true of <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/04/climate-change-disease/2623863/">Valley fever in the western US</a>. Dengue fever is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/02/australia-risk-disease-climate-change">advancing on Australia</a> and public health officials in the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/may/05/uk-tropical-disease-malaria-threat">United Kingdom have been sounding the alarm about malaria</a>.</p> <h2>Collaboration is the only way forward</h2> <p>Lawrence’s sustainability credentials are impressive. In Seattle, he led the creation of the first municipal sustainability plan in the US (one of the first globally) and has served as an advisor to President Clinton’s Administration Council on Sustainable Development as well as similar bodies in South America and Europe, including the European Academy for the Urban Environment in Berlin and the Organization for Economic and Community Development in Paris.</p> <p>In the private sector, he worked as a sustainability leader at international consulting and engineering firm, Arup, before joining <a href="http://www.aecom.com/">Aecom Technology Corporation</a> more recently.</p> <p>In a session titled “Climate Change and the Bottom Line: Risk and Reward” at SXSW Eco, a three-day conference on matters of environmental sustainability from tech to policy to design and grassroots advocacy, Lawrence said the greatest challenge to responding to growing risk – from infectious disease to sea-level rise – involves communication and collaboration.</p> <p>The habit of thinking “in sectors” needs to change, he said.</p> <p>“The coasts are sinking faster than sea level is rising, but we don’t have conversations about that at all because it requires we get geologists involved in this discussion and what do geologists have to do with sustainability? Well, in that context they have everything to do with sustainability.”</p> <p>In another example of compartmentalized thinking, he credited the United Nations for its tremendous vision of poverty relief but claimed the intergovernmental organization simply doesn’t understand how money works. Worse: its bureaucrats have a generalized distrust of the private sector. For its part, the private sector has a jaded view of governments, which are often corrupt and in many ways function on bribes, Lawrence said.</p> <p>“The question for us and the UN is, can we both recognize we have aspects of evil within us that need to be curbed if we’re actually going to help optimize conditions for poor people in the world.”</p> <p>Attempting to put the climate challenge in perspective, he commented on the world’s obsession over the Malaysian jetliner that went missing in March with hundreds of passengers on board. If the planet reaches a six-degree Celsius rise in average temperatures in 100 years, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/world-on-track-for-nearly-11-degree-temperature-rise-energy-expert-says/2011/11/28/gIQAi0lM6N_story.html">as is projected</a>, “the effect on human population will be as if 1000 airliners a day were crashing.”</p> <p>Those impacts are expected to come from a variety of sources, including heatwaves, extreme weather events, drought, and the spread of disease – potentially exacerbated by governmental inaction and resource disparities.</p> <p>How will such dire predictions impact Western development when it comes to infectious disease planning in the near-term?</p> <p>Despite his personal encouragements, Lawrence told the Guardian he is not optimistic.</p> <p>“Sadly, that’s because most of the people who are dying are poor. When a Western industrial society starts to collapse related to disease … someone is going to decide, ‘Ah, this is a problem that has to be solved.’ It’s not a problem that has to be solved yet.”</p> <p> <em>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/values-led-business">values-led business</a> hub is funded by SC Johnson.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/09/excalibur-ebola-dog-conspiracy-theories <p>Finally, the west has the first ebola victim it feels bad about. It was a dog.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Twitter was all aflutter with calls to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/08/health/save-excalibur-ebola-dog/index.html">spare the life of Excalibur, a dog owned by a Spanish nurse’s assistant</a> from Madrid named Teresa Ramos. Ramos contracted Ebola, probably from caring for Spanish missionaries to Africa, and has been quarantined. Her husband was put in isolation to see if he had caught the disease via contact with her. So far, it looks like he has not. Still, despite <a href="https://www.change.org/p/no-al-sacrificio-de-excalibur-el-perro-de-la-auxiliar-de-enfermer%C3%ADa-contagiada-por-el-virus-del-%C3%A9bola">some 400,000 signatures on Change.org</a> and public protests, the Spanish government <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/excalibur-spanish-ebola-patient-dog-euthanised">opted to euthanize and cremate the dog</a>, based <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/madrid-will-kill-dog-woman-infected-ebola-n220361">on only one medical study of questionable accuracy</a> that says dogs can contract the virus and remain asymptomatic.</p> <p>That sucks. Spain doesn’t suck, but Dog Torquemada, whoever he is, definitely sucks.</p> <p>That the internet was upset makes a basic kind of internet sense. During horrible human and natural events, people post pictures of dogs to cheer themselves up. There are whole sites and Facebook feeds and Instagram accounts dedicated to the mediating images of dogs being happy in spite of everything.</p> <p>Dogs are even better in real life. They’re like people with all the stuff that sucks removed. It takes much less time to housebreak them. They don’t talk back. You are always the highlight of their day, and they’re always sad to see you leave. And almost any awful thing you can say or do will be forgiven and then forgotten within half an hour. You will spend the rest of your life remembering every time you ignored them or shooed them away because of some ephemeral distraction – some mean selfishness you will always wish you could retract – and your memory will repay you with the knowledge that your attitude was rewarded with unstinting loyalty. There’s even <a href="http://jezebel.com/commercial-uses-adorable-puppy-to-stop-you-from-drinkin-1637474377">a Budweiser ad about drinking and driving</a> that relies on making you think of some poor dog dying of a broken heart waiting for someone to come home who never will.</p> <p>The story of Ramos’s dog resonates with us so much for two reasons. One, many of us know what it’s like to lose a pet. Two, it’s hard to politicize dogs. As much as you might weep to think of those Soviet dogs strapped with explosives and trained to run under Wehrmacht tanks and blow them up from the underside, they weren’t really <em>Soviet</em> dogs. Hitler had dogs, but there was no way his dogs knew he was <em>Hitler</em>. There are no Maoist Third World dogs. And there’s no constitutional conservatism particular to an animal that can lick enthusiastically at its own anus, even if that metaphor is the first thing that leaps to mind watching <a href="https://twitter.com/Mobute/status/517071855149395968">Bill Kristol</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Mobute/status/491420613350031360">John Podhoretz</a>. Invariably someone <a href="https://twitter.com/femscreenwriter/status/498143176058609665">tweets a picture of a dog with pro-Israel swag</a>, and it’s always absurd. Often the dog looks irritated to have something on it, or curious what the hell its owner is doing. When it looks happy, it looks about as happy as it would be if some random Palestinian asked <em>who’s a good boy, </em>presumably in whatever language is used to determine good boys in that dog’s household.</p> <p>But people? You can politicize the hell out of them, to the point where you wipe all meaning they had off the face of the earth, long after Ebola does the same to them physically. Four thousand dead in Africa? They must have died because they’re <a href="http://mediamatters.org/video/2014/10/06/foxs-bernie-goldberg-many-africans-are-backward/201039">an intrinsically backward people who believe in magicks</a>. They probably don’t even believe in the constitution. Or they’re just an excuse for President Obama to <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/26/laura_ingraham_obama_wants_to_expose_troops_to_ebola_to_make_up_for_colonialism/">poison our troops as a really confusing and abstract apology for colonialism</a>. Those 4,000 people must not even have had the honesty to die in some regular way; they died as <em>props</em>.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/Independent/statuses/519441477450354688">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>CNN is asking the stupid Ebola questions <a href="http://t.co/5awCkpl0Uy">http://t.co/5awCkpl0Uy</a> <a href="http://t.co/3flxvcQAnU">pic.twitter.com/3flxvcQAnU</a></p>&mdash; The Independent (@Independent) <a href="https://twitter.com/Independent/status/519441477450354688">October 7, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>About the only thing you can hang on a dog is a collar, but you can change the subject by engineering paranoia about people to such an extent that any people or fear will do.

That’s important, because <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-is-ebola">Ebola is the Isis of biological agents</a>.

(Maybe he contracted Ebola from Isis agents hiding among all those Honduran kids. Who knows? Who cares!) <br /></p> <p>The fact is, it’s a lot harder to dehumanize a dog than it is to dehumanize a person. You can’t impute sinister motives to a dog. You can’t prove that the dog brought it on himself, via a rejection of modernity or liberty or due to elaborate subterfuge. You can’t make the dog an actor in an arcane and hateful agenda to rip the country apart from its innards on out. All you can do is think of the pity of the poor creature, isolated from his loved ones, dying alone.</p> <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan">Thomas Duncan did that on Wednesday, too</a>.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/ebola-outbreak-simulations-tested-uk-hospitals <p>War game-style simulations to test Britain’s ability to cope with an outbreak of Ebola will be staged this weekend in hospitals in the north and south of England.</p> <p>Officials at the Department of Health are drawing up details of at least two simulations which will involve people posing as victims of the deadly virus to assess the real-time response of hospitals, the ambulance service and local authorities. The exercise will take place on either Saturday or Sunday and details of which hospitals will be chosen to handle the mock cases are being kept confidential to minimise disruption to the exercise, an official said.</p> <p>They may include the Royal Free hospital in north London which has an isolation unit and a dedicated team of nurses, doctors and laboratory staff specialising in dealing with infectious diseases. The Royal Liverpool, Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield and the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne also have infectious disease units that are expected to receive cases. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has acknowledged that it was “entirely possible” Ebola could reach Britain.</p> <p>“We are planning as we speak,” said a Department of Health spokesperson. “It is going to test the emergency preparedness of the NHS and a number of hospitals are going to be involved. We will pretend there is an Ebola case in this country to test the response of the NHS, ambulance service, local authorities and police to make sure everything works in real time. There may be more exercises, but there will be at least one in the north and one in the south.”</p> <p>Details of the exercises came amid calls for new screening of passengers arriving at UK airports from west Africa where the virus has claimed at least 3,879 lives according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, which scrutinises border controls, has called for tests at airports, railway stations and ports as well as greater support for immigration officers to make sure they have the training to deal with the outbreak.</p> <p>“Our immediate response should be to tighten regulation and introduce measures such as screenings at airports, train stations and ferry ports to ensure that this deadly disease cannot take more lives,” he said.</p> <p>On Thursday the government resisted such a move, pointing to WHO advice that suggests screening for people with fevers or temperature is better conducted in the exit country.</p> <p>“The World Health Organisation advice is that it is better to screen on exit from a country to make sure that people who are leaving are not infected, rather than trying to screen people who arrive,” said Michael Fallon, the defence secretary. “At the moment there are no direct flights from Sierra Leone to the United Kingdom. It is very hard to be able to track people who are changing planes and arriving by different means in the United Kingdom. It is particularly difficult because the symptoms may not be obvious for a number of weeks after you actually catch the disease. It is not straightforward.”</p> <p>A spokesman for Public Health England said it was important to recognise that the chances of infection increase as symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting worsen. Corpses are the most dangerous cause of transmission.</p> <p>“If you are symptomatic [of Ebola] and infectious you are not going to be in a position to be hopping on a plane,” he said.</p> <p>Earlier, one of the world’s leading experts on the virus played down the risks of a serious outbreak in the UK. Prof Peter Piot, a Belgian microbiologist who is part of the World Health Organisation’s Ebola science group and was part of the team that identified Ebola in 1976, told the BBC: “I’m not concerned about an outbreak in western Europe, in the UK, like we are seeing in west Africa.”</p> <p>But he added: “We will see other cases in Europe, this is unavoidable. People travel, people come back, people get infected in west Africa – volunteers. So we need to be prepared for more cases like this.”</p> <p>Public Health England has moved to quell concern among parents about the threat the virus poses to school children after it emerged on Wednesday that a school in Stockport had cancelled a planned school placement of a nine-year-old from Sierra Leone after complaints from parents. Public Health England stressed that the risk of Ebola arriving in the UK is “very low”. And it has told all education and childcare organisations not to restrict the teaching or activities of anyone who has travelled to affected countries if they show no symptoms of the deadly disease.</p> <p>It has urged school staff to look out for Ebola symptoms including fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, and weakness. Next, if such symptoms are apparent, teachers must establish whether students or children have spent time in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone or Nigeria in the last 21 days. If they have the student or child should be immediately separated from others and an ambulance called. Education staff are also urged to inform emergency staff that a case of Ebola is suspected to ensure that protective equipment is used.</p> <p>Universities UK, the body that campaigns for higher education organisations, said its members were “closely monitoring” students for signs of Ebola. It said latest advice has been circulated to heads of department, student services, accommodation staff, estate managers and student health centres. It said it was not aware that any restrictions being placed on students who had travelled to affected countries.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/09/ebola-myths-sierra-leone-dj-tackles-rumours <p>The Ebola outbreak was sparked by a bewitched aircraft that crashed in a remote part of Sierra Leone, casting a spell over three west African countries, but a heavily alcoholic drink called bitter Kola can cure the virus.</p> <p>These are just two of the rumours dispelled on <a href="https://twitter.com/Amarabangs">Amara Bangura</a>’s weekly radio show, which is networked through <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/">BBC Media Action</a> and broadcast on 35 stations across the country.</p> <p>“You have to deal with the issues of myth, you have to deal with the issues of religion, you have to answer questions about prevention and how to stay safe,” said Bangura.</p> <p>The presenter selects questions from thousands of text messages sent in from around the country and puts them to health experts and government officials. “Our radio programme has been very useful in helping people change their attitudes,” he said, noting that not all Sierra Leoneans are following guidelines aimed at preventing the spread of Ebola.</p> <p>Bangura, who is from one of Sierra Leone’s worst-hit districts, believes officials must engage with communities to alter deeply entrenched beliefs that lead people to seek religious counsel instead of medical treatment.</p> <p>“We’ve been telling them if you experience any signs or symptoms of Ebola, please go to the medical hospital,” he said. “Don’t go to the church or the mosque, you’re not going to get treatment there. You can pray as much as you can but go to the hospital for treatment.”</p> <p>Bangura added that his radio show is an integral part of the Ebola response: “Everybody listens to the radio and it’s the best way to communicate with people. You want to reach out to people in rural areas – they don’t have access to newspapers, they don’t have access to television – and you want to talk to people in a language they understand in a simple way.”</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/09/ebola-response-diaspora-sierra-leone <p>When the government of Sierra Leone announced a three-day lockdown for the capital, Freetown, in September, boredom and cabin fever were not the only concerns for those forbidden to leave their homes. </p> <p>A vast majority of Sierra Leoneans live hand-to-mouth, and many do not have the means to store food and keep it fresh. How then would they cope without being able to go out and buy food each day? This question occurred to Memuna Janneh, a British-Sierra Leonean living in London. In response, she funded and coordinated an effort, implemented by family and friends in the country, to distribute meals to those caught up in the lockdown. </p> <p>“I live in Sierra Leone for part of the year so I know people who would struggle,” said Janneh. “I wanted to organise something for them but then I thought: ‘No, I have to help as many people as I can manage at the time.’”</p> <p>It took just over a week to organise the logistics: obtaining government passes to travel around, finding NGOs in country with the infrastructure they could work with, as well as shopping for food and organising the cooking. In the three days of the lockdown, <a href="http://www.lunchboxgift.com/">Lunchbox</a> fed approximately 2,600 people in seven different communities. </p> <p>But this has not been the only diaspora-led response to the Ebola crisis. Around the time of the outbreak, employees of the <a href="http://www.slwt.org/">Sierra Leone War Trust for Children</a> were on holiday in London. For various reasons, the group was unable to return home. Wanting to find a practical way to provide support, they bought and sent back 750 raincoats for okada (commercial motorbike) riders to wear, so they could continue to carry passengers without fear of transmission.</p> <p>“People aren’t sitting around waiting for governments to sort things out,” said Ade Daramy, chair and spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.engayde.org/">UK Sierra Leone Diaspora Ebola Task Force</a>. “Nobody had thought of that idea, even the okada riders hadn’t. They were just going to lose passengers as far as they were aware, but the initiative actually rescued their livelihoods in a major way.” </p> <p>It is not uncommon for the diaspora to lend their support when their home countries experience crisis, but Ebola has “concentrated minds” in a way that nothing has since the civil war. “Everybody seems to be directly related to somebody who has died, recovered, or been affected in another way, or knows somebody who knows somebody ... We’ve all been touched by it,” explained Daramy. </p> <p>But the diaspora’s involvement in Ebola relief efforts have not been without their challenges, and the absence of a coordinated response is one of the main concerns. </p> <p>“At the moment, there are too many pockets of people dotted around – there is no system in place,” said Nick Asgill, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTbEtZLJbuY&amp;feature=youtu.be">took to YouTube</a> to express his opinions and experience of what is happening in Sierra Leone. “There needs to be a clear line of communication that reaches out to all of the diaspora.” </p> <p>This is the idea behind the UK Sierra Leone Diaspora Ebola Task Force, which attempts to galvanise the community towards a coordinated response. As well as organising fundraising events for <a href="http://www.advocaidsl.com/">AdvocAid</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sierraleoneemergencyebolafund">Sierra Leone Ebola Emergency Response Fund</a>, and King’s College London’s <a href="http://kslp.org.uk/">Sierra Leone Partnership</a>, the task force have been involved in negotiations with Public Health England, the NHS and DfID to recruit people to staff the clinics being built in the country. </p> <p>“The initial call went out to Sierra Leoneans and people of Sierra Leonean descent, but it’s now gone wider,” explained Daramy. “We don’t just want doctors and nurses. The clinics being built in Sierra Leone will hopefully be run along NHS guidelines, so we want anyone who’s worked in the NHS – from surgeons to cleaners.” A website named <a href="http://www.engayde.org">EngAyde</a> (meaning “to put heads together”) has also been established in an effort to structure diaspora-led response.</p> <p>Despite complications with coordination, the diaspora’s contribution to the Ebola relief effort should not be disregarded.<br /></p> <p>In Sierra Leone, there are no formal arrangements for people to be fed in hospitals, so families cook food and take it to their relatives. But with Ebola, there’s no way this can happen. With authorisation from the <a href="http://health.gov.sl/">Ministry of Health and Sanitation</a>, Lunchbox now has plans to extend the initiative to medical centres, providing 50,000 meals over the next three months to people in three hospitals in Freetown. </p> <p>“While we have the big state players doing all the grand stuff there are little things that ordinary citizens like myself can actually do,” said Janneh. “I certainly don’t want to sit on the sidelines just watching. I want to be right at the forefront, trying to do my bit.”</p> <p><em>We want to hear from the diaspora – from Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and other affected countries – about how you’re responding to the Ebola crisis.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/09/why-britain-sending-troops-ebola-sierra-leone <p>After yesterday’s meeting of the government’s crisis group, Cobra, it was announced that the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/british-troops-sent-fight-ebola-sierra-leone" title="">UK would be sending 750 troops</a> and a hospital ship to Sierra Leone to help combat the spread of Ebola there. It subsequently transpired that the deployments were already in progress, and that many of the troops were there or on their way there.</p> <p>Along with making known that hospitals throughout the UK had contingency measures in place to deal with any incidence of Ebola here, this was the first official government response to the epidemic now threatening west Africa. It came on the day that the western world seemed suddenly caught up in the epidemic as it had not been before.</p> <p>Thomas Duncan, a Liberian national, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan" title="">became the first person</a> to die of the disease in the United States. The Spanish stepped up efforts to trace contacts of a nurse who contracted the disease while helping to care for an Ebola patient in a Madrid hospital – a precautionary measure <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/08/excalibur-ebola-patient-dog-animal-rights-video" title="">included putting down her family dog</a> – and the US announced that it would screen airport arrivals from affected countries.</p> <p>The US measures immediately prompted questions here about why the UK was not introducing airport screening too. The answer sounded a bit defeatist but was not unreasonable. Huge numbers of people arrive at UK airports every day, and many have a raised temperature after a long journey. The incubation period for Ebola can be up to 21 days, so that even the most effective screening would probably not identify someone with the disease. Airport screening would be an enormous and largely counterproductive effort. To which might be added the general inefficiency of UK border controls in apprehending suspected terrorists and others wanted by the authorities.</p> <p>A more pertinent question might concern the government’s decision to send in the army. In a way, dispatching troops to Sierra Leone is a perfect example of the thinking we have so often seen in relation to terrorism: we are fighting over there so as not to have to fight over here. The UK has a special relationship of a kind with Sierra Leone, which offers a rare example of successful British military intervention – in the 1999-2000 civil war – so UK military personnel might be more familiar and welcome there than in other affected countries.</p> <p>But is building an emergency hospital – which is one of the army’s tasks – and treating patients offshore really something the military ought to be doing? Where is the Department for International Development in all this, and the UK’s vast charity sector? In war zones, such as Afghanistan, there can be friction between development types and the military whose protection is at once a necessity and a liability. Here, the tensions might work the other way around, with civilian organisations effectively sidelined.</p> <p>It can no doubt be argued that the military are experts in providing emergency and temporary facilities and no one can get a job done like the army. But the top brass have been complaining about cuts in numbers of deployable troops, and disease containment is not obviously something the military should be doing, when there is still a (small) presence in Afghanistan and reinforcements may be needed for the international effort against Islamic State (Isis).</p> <p>So could there be another dimension to this deployment – as a contingency, say, against the inability of the Sierra Leone authorities to enforce a quarantine regime, or even against a possible breakdown of law and order. And if such a contingency is – even distantly – envisaged, is Sierra Leone being regarded as something of a test-bed or training exercise for what – in the extreme – must be prepared for here?</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-crisis-world-bank-president-jim-kim-failure <p>The president of the World Bank, Jim Kim, admitted on Wednesday that the international community had “failed miserably” in its response to the Ebola virus that has killed more than 3,800 people in west Africa and warned that the crisis now affecting Spain and the US was going to get much worse.</p> <p>Amid signs yesterday that western governments were being forced to take the risks of a global pandemic more seriously, Kim said he wanted them to back a new $20bn (£12bn) global health fund that would be able to react instantly to emergencies.</p> <p>“It’s late. It’s really late,” he said in an interview with the Guardian before the annual meeting of the Washington-based organisation this weekend.</p> <p>“We should have done so many things. Healthcare systems should have been built. There should have been monitoring when the first cases were reported. There should have been an organised response.”</p> <p>Kim’s warning that the global community was still not “moving fast enough” came as the Ebola virus claimed its first victim in the US and news of a case in Spain sent shares in travel and airline companies tumbling on stock exchanges.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) said the number of deaths from Ebola in west Africa now stood at 3,879 with no evidence that the epidemic was being brought under control.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/oct/09/ebola-disease-in-a-day-live">Ebola: the disease in a day – live blog</a><br /></strong></li> <li> <strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/-sp-ebola-west-africa-health-workers"> Frontline health workers paying with their lives</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/british-troops-sent-fight-ebola-sierra-leone">British troops to be sent to help fight Ebola</a></strong> </li> <li> <strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-gearing-up-uk-unlikely"> Hospitals readying for unlikely case of UK outbreak</a></strong> </li> <li><strong> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/family-ebola-victim-dallas-eric-duncan"> Family of US Ebola victim mourn in isolation</a></strong> </li> </ul> <p>The US has announced that it is scaling up its efforts and will tighten screening procedures at airports from this weekend.</p> <p>Thomas Duncan, who died in a Dallas hospital on Wednesday after arriving from Liberia, lied in a questionnaire about whether he had been in contact with anyone affected by Ebola.</p> <p>Britain also announced on Wednesday that it was scaling up its efforts to deal with the Ebola virus which has gripped three west African countries –Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.</p> <p>All of England’s major hospitals are making preparations to isolate and treat patients suspected of having Ebola if a serious outbreak occurs, while more than 750 military personnel and the medical ship RFA Argus are being sent to west Africa to help contain the outbreak.</p> <p>RFA Argus has a fully-equipped hospital including critical care and high-dependency units, and will be sent to Sierra Leone along with three Merlin helicopters.</p> <p>The announcement followed a meeting of the government’s Cobra emergency committee, chaired by the UK prime minister.</p> <p>However the government has come under pressure to do more to prevent the disease spreading in the UK, including calls for the introduction of screening at airports and other transport hubs.</p> <p>Keith Vaz, chairman of Britain’s Commons home affairs select committee, said: “We must do all we can, both at the source and in the UK, to combat the spread of this virus.</p> <p>“Our immediate response should be to tighten regulation and introduce measures such as screenings at airports, train stations and ferry ports to ensure that this deadly disease cannot take more lives.</p> <p>“Immigration officers are not trained health professionals. Greater support must be offered to ensure that they are equipped to deal with this outbreak to prevent it reaching the UK.”</p> <p>Kim said he welcomed the UK and the US scaling up their efforts, but said that a high price was being paid for 11 months of delay and inter-agency argument.</p> <p>“Now that there are cases in Spain and the US, the chance of the virus going to other European countries is fairly high,” he said.</p> <p>In a blunt assessment of how the international community had coped with the crisis, Kim said: “We were tested by Ebola and we failed. We failed miserably in our response.”</p> <p>He urged finance ministers attending meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund this weekend to provide the resources needed to treat Ebola patients in their home countries.</p> <p>Under the Bank’s plan, resources would be provided to build big specialised treatment centres and to extend care to local communities. Every developed country should be prepared to send trained medical staff to west Africa, Kim said.</p> <p>“We don’t need to stop all travel from these countries. It’s going to be impossible to stop people. The way to stop the flow of patients from these countries getting to the rest of the world is to have programmes that will treat people and increase survival dramatically. It’s possible.</p> <p>“We need to have quality services in place so that the motivation to leave these countries goes away. It is a rational thing to do to get away because we don’t have the treatment in place.”</p> <p>Rudimentary healthcare systems in the three west African countries have encouraged people to travel abroad for treatment, thereby spreading the virus. Before the crisis, Liberia had 61 doctors and 1,000 nurses, while Sierra Leone had 327 hospital beds.</p> <p>“I say to finance ministers: look at what’s happening in Spain right now. It is going to get much worse.”</p> <p>The authorities in Spain said they were dealing with the first case of Ebola that had been transmitted outside of the three west African countries – a nurse who treated a priest who had flown to Madrid for care.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation said further “sporadic” cases of Ebola in Europe were now inevitable.</p> <p>A World Bank study released on Wednesday showed that the economic cost of Ebola could be as high as $33bn over the next two years if the virus spreads to neighbouring countries in west Africa.</p> <p>Kim admitted that the Bank had been having arguments with the WHO over Ebola but that they had now stopped.</p> <p>“The most important thing is to stop arguing about what is or is not possible and to get on with doing what’s needed.”</p> <p>Kim said his plan involved big treatment centres being set up by the US and the UK together with attempts to provide as full a range of services as possible into local communities.</p> <p>He said: “It would be good if you could manage the treatment of people close to home. But you can’t do that without the personnel.</p> <p>“We need to put the capacity into place so that cases are identified more quickly.”</p> <p>Oxfam criticised the World Bank for its failure to invest enough in healthcare and in its promotion of user-fees and privatisation.</p> <p>Nicolas Mombrial, head of Oxfam in Washington, said: “This has changed rhetorically under Jim Kim. We hope to see it play out in the Bank’s lending and advice from now. Ebola should serve to accelerate this change.”</p> <p>Kim said that countries such as Sierra Leone had used financial support from the Bank to improve energy supplies, but added: “This has taught us that we have to be much more serious about putting health systems into place.”</p> <p>He contrasted health systems in the three west African countries with Rwanda, which has 55,000 health workers. “If this had happened in Rwanda we would have had it under control.”</p> <p>Kim said it was fortunate Ebola was not a quick-moving virus but the chances of a quick moving virus in the next 10 years is high.</p> <p>“This was sloppy work on even a slow-moving virus like Ebola. If we have seen this with a slow moving virus we are not even close to being ready to deal with a fast moving virus.”</p> <p>He said Ebola highlighted the need to have a speedier way of responding to health crises.</p> <p>“Why don’t we have a multibillion dollar fund of $10bn, $15bn or $20bn set up so that once there is a global health emergency it can be drawn down on very quickly?”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/09/ebola-fears-woman-observation-cairns-hospital-sierra-leone <p>A Red Cross nurse in far north Queensland is undergoing tests in an isolation unit to see if she is suffering from Australia’s first case of Ebola.</p> <p>The nurse, named in the media as Sue-Ellen Kovack, 57, returned to Australia on Tuesday after a month working in Sierra Leone, one of the countries hardest hit by the epidemic which has so far claimed almost 3,900 lives across five west African countries.</p> <p>She was under observation in Cairns hospital, Queensland’s chief health officer, Jeanette Young, confirmed.</p> <p>She had been kept in home isolation and was admitted to hospital with a low-grade fever on Thursday.</p> <p>Young emphasised there was zero risk to the Cairns community of infection as the nurse had followed protocols when returning to Australia.</p> <p>“She has not been out in the community in Cairns. She has been at home, isolated in her own home, testing herself,” she said.</p> <p>The head of the Australian Red Cross international program, Peter Walton, said the nurse remained upbeat despite her situation.<br /> </p> <p>“She’s doing well, but obviously she just has to play a bit of a waiting game at the moment,” he said.</p> <p>Walton said it was vital Red Cross aid workers were available to help combat the Ebola crisis, but everything possible was done to reduce the risk to them.<br /> </p> <p>“It’s a tribute to the bravery and courage of many health workers and aid workers that they do go to very difficult environments,” he said.<br /> </p> <p>“We do all we can to mitigate all the risks attached to that.<br /> </p> <p>“But certainly given a situation and an epidemic such as Ebola, it’s absolutely imperative that we do our part to try to contain it.”<br /> </p> <p>He said the nurse was well-regarded and had followed stringent isolation procedures on returning from west Africa a week ago.<br /> </p> <p>“She went over to west Africa as a clinical nurse, and very well-regarded professional in that regard,” Walton told reporters.<br /> </p> <p>“I think it’s a tribute to her professionalism that she has followed that to the ledger of the guidelines, and hence why she presented to Queensland Health authorities.”</p> <p>Young saluted the nurse’s courage in travelling to Sierra Leone to treat Ebola patients. “I think she’s an amazing lady to go to Africa and provide that service,” Young said.</p> <p>She said Ebola was contracted through contact with excretions such as blood, vomiting and diarrhea, and, since the nurse had exhibited none of those symptoms, there was no risk she had infected anyone else, if she did have Ebola.</p> <p>Blood was taken from Kovack at Cairns hospital on Thursday afternoon and flown to Brisbane to be tested. The results would be known either late on Thursday night or in the early hours of Friday morning.</p> <p>When asked how likely it was the woman did have the virus, Young responded: “I am treating it as if it was, because I don’t know how likely it is. Because she has been in Sierra Leone looking after people sick with Ebola, there is potential there that’s why we are treating it seriously.”</p> <p>Queensland Health is also monitoring a doctor in home isolation in south Brisbane who has returned from treating Ebola patients overseas.</p> <p>Young said there were “absolutely no concerns” for any passengers who were on the same plane as the woman as she returned to Australia because she was had no symptoms when she flew.</p> <p>“Ebola is very difficult to transmit, it’s not like flu,” she said.</p> <p>Several Red Cross workers have travelled from Australia to West Africa in the past few months to work with Ebola patients.</p> <p>Walton, told the ABC last month the Red Cross was reaching more than 10m people in West Africa with information and education about Ebola.</p> <p>“Since people first became sick with Ebola, over 1,500 trained Red Cross volunteers have been working around the clock to help people understand how they can protect themselves and prevent further spread of the disease,” he said.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, on Wednesday called on countries to pull their weight in the battle to halt Ebola.</p> <p>“Smaller countries have stepped up to the plate – some quite remarkably,” he said. </p> <p>“Some smaller countries are contributing way above their per capita population. But the fact is more countries can and must step up to make their contributions felt.”</p> <p>Kerry referred to US <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/10/08/john-kerry-other-countries-need-to-do-more-to-stop-ebola/">State Department figures</a> showing Australia had contributed US$7.5m ($8.5m) to the effort, more than Germany (US$3.2m) or Japan (US$3m), but much less than the Netherlands (US$21m) or Canada (US$31.9m). Australia has subsequently announced a further contribution of $10m.</p> <p>The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has cited the difficulty of repatriating health workers safely as a reason for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/ebola-sierra-leone-president-appeal-australian-help">not sending them to west Africa</a>.</p> <p>On Thursday, Abbott maintained there was no need to send Australian health officials to the region to help contain the epidemic.</p> <p>“As I understand things the public health systems in some of the west African countries are all but overwhelmed and there’s really not much point deploying Australian personnel, over and above those that are already there with NGOs, into a situation without a clear plan and that’s what we need.”</p> <p>Bob Katter, whose electorate of Kennedy takes in part of Cairns, used the scare to criticise the protocols of the Australian government, saying any person who went to an Ebola-affected country should be quarantined in government facilities for three weeks.</p> <p>“The incomprehensive [sic] irresponsibility of the authorities in this, if you want a visa to go to an Ebola-infected country then when you come back to Australia you must go into quarantined isolation,” he said.</p> <p>“We love these people, and we honour these Australians for being self-sacrificing, but compared to the risk they create for our country – it is not remotely comparable. One person’s moral and humanitarian ambitions are being carried out at a very grave cost to Australia.”</p> <p>Kerry said the State Department figures showed “the very real need for more countries to move resources of specific kinds”.</p> <p>“It is not just a question of sending people,” he said, “though it is vital to send people. But we need Ebola treatment units. We need healthcare workers. We need medevac capacity. We need mobile laboratories and staff.”</p> <p>The shadow foreign minister, Tanya Plibersek, and the opposition health spokeswoman, Catherine King, were calling last week for Australia to send people to West Africa to help treat patients and provide expertise.</p> <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/ebola-airport-screening-australia">Australian quarantine officers have held six people </a>suspected of having <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola">Ebola</a> at airports after interviewing 651 travellers between August and 1 October as part of Australia’s efforts to keep the disease out of the country.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/09/ebola-guinea-family-west-africa-crisis <p>In December last year, near the village of Meliandou in southern Guinea, two-year-old Emile may have come into contact with one of the fruit bats that fly through west Africa’s skies, often gathering at dusk to roost in trees.</p> <p>In that moment, Emile was destined for a place in history as Patient Zero, the unfortunate first victim of an Ebola outbreak that has already killed more than <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/136020/1/roadmapsitrep_8Oct2014_eng.pdf?ua=1">3800 people</a> and wreaked havoc across some of the most fragile countries in west Africa. The crisis has been described as “unparalleled in modern times”.</p> <p>On 26 December, Emile fell ill with fever. He died two days later. Eight days after that, his three-year-old sister Philomena died. His mother Sia succumbed to the disease on 11 January, and his grandmother Koumba three days later, in a hospital in the nearby town of Guéckédou. Researchers believe that their funerals marked the next steps on the virus’s devastating sweep through Guinea and across the nearby borders into Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>“Following the young boy’s death, the mysterious disease continued to smoulder undetected, causing several chains of deadly transmission,” <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/ebola-6-months/guinea/en/">according to the World Health Organisation</a> (WHO). Villagers were frightened, and doctors were baffled. Some thought it was an outbreak of cholera. But no one was sure, and in this information vacuum the virus reached nearby towns and crossed borders.</p> <p>The WHO identified Meliandou as lying in the outbreak’s “hot zone”: a triangle-shaped forested area where the porous borders of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone converge. These countries have endured years of intertwined conflict over diamonds and other resources, leaving them with limited health services and a population used to crossing borders to seek work or refuge.</p> <p>In a <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/ebola-6-months/guinea-chart-big.png?ua=1">chart mapping the current outbreak’s spread</a>, the WHO says a friend of Emile’s family from Sierra Leone contracted the disease and died in Kangama, which lies south-west of Guéckédou and across the border. The graphic’s Ebola tree of death also shows Koumba’s nephew travelling to the Guinean capital, Conakry, where he died on 5 February.</p> <p>So began a chain of viral devastation, whose links represent individual lives cut short and ineluctable steps on Ebola’s path through west Africa.</p> <p>In an <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1404505#t=article">article published in the New England Journal in April</a>, researchers also tracked the spread of the outbreak, saying an infected health worker extended the disease’s reach beyond Guéckédou to surrounding areas.</p> <p>“On 10 March 2014, hospitals and public health services in Guéckédou and Macenta alerted the ministry of health of Guinea and – two days later – Médecins sans Frontières about clusters of a mysterious disease characterised by fever, severe diarrhoea, vomiting and an apparent high fatality rate,” the researchers wrote.</p> <p>On 23 March, the WHO published a formal notification of an Ebola outbreak in Guinea on its website. By 8 August, it declared the epidemic to be a “public health emergency of international concern”.</p> <p>That month, a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/23/ebola-outbreak-blamed-on-fruit-bats-africa">team of European and African researchers confirmed the hypothesis</a> that the outbreak was caused by a toddler’s contact with a single infected bat.</p> <p>The 17 experts spent three weeks around Meliandou, interviewing residents and capturing bats and other animals. They concluded that the disease was spread by colonies of migratory fruit bats.</p> <p>Today, more than nine months after Emile’s death, exhausted and often ill-equipped health workers are still battling the virus in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Smaller outbreaks were identified in Senegal and Nigeria but were swiftly brought under control. The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/united-states-imported-case.html">first diagnosed case of Ebola in the US</a> was announced on 30 September.</p> <p>On 6 October, Spanish authorities said that a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-crisis-substandard-equipment-nurse-positive-spain">nurse who treated a Spanish priest – who had contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone and subsequently died in Madrid – had tested positive for the disease</a>. She became the first person to contract the disease outside west Africa.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 13 October 2014 to remove a statement that a two-year-old child in Meliandou, later identified as west Africa’s first case of Ebola, was bitten by a bat.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/ebola-airport-screening-australia <p>Australian quarantine officers have held six people suspected of having Ebola at airports after interviewing 651 travellers in the past few months as part of the efforts to keep the disease out of the country.<br /></p> <p>As the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-dallas-deputy-sheriff-hospital-symptoms-death">first man to be diagnosed with Ebola in the US died</a> on Wednesday the prime minister has said while it is “not impossible” it could spread to Australia there are many safety measures in place.</p> <p>“It’s not impossible that it will come here but what we’re doing is carefully monitoring everyone who’s coming into this country who’s been to West Africa,” Tony Abbott told 3AW on Thursday.</p> <p>“In every state, public hospitals have been prepared to deal with Ebola cases should we get any. We’ve spent $80m on top of the $40m we give every year to the World Health Organisation specifically on Ebola precautions. We’re constantly monitoring and reviewing the situation to see what more can be done.”</p> <p>More than 600 people have been interviewed at airports by quarantine officers between August and 1 October, a spokesman for the Australian health department said. Six were referred for further consideration but all were cleared of the virus. </p> <p>Of the six, three had been to funerals in Nigeria, but none of those were for people who had died of Ebola. Two more were doctors returning from West Africa.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, on Wednesday called on other countries to pull their weight in the battle to halt Ebola.<br /></p> <p>“Smaller countries have stepped up to the plate – some quite remarkably,” he said. “Some smaller countries are contributing way above their per capita population.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-dallas-deputy-sheriff-hospital-symptoms-death <p>The heightened sense of anxiety over the spread of Ebola to the US was amplified on Wednesday when Thomas Eric Duncan, the first man diagnosed with the disease outside Africa, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan">died</a> and a law enforcement official was admitted to hospital after having been in the apartment where Duncan stayed.<br /></p> <p>“The risk is minimal,” Maher Maso, the mayor of Frisco, a northern Dallas suburb, said at a hastily-called press conference about the law enforcement official, a Dallas county sheriff’s deputy, on Wednesday afternoon. He added that authorities are moving forward “with an abundance of caution”. </p> <p>Frisco fire chief Mark Piland said the man had visited the apartment where Duncan stayed <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/thomas-eric-duncan-liberia-ebola-war-texas-family-obituary">after he arrived in the US last week</a> and interacted with some of the people who live there, all of whom are under quarantine and not exhibiting symptoms. He was transported by ambulance to the hospital after going to an urgent care facility with “some” Ebola-like symptoms, which can also be symptoms of other illnesses. The ambulance crew who helped the sheriff into the vehicle wore protective suits and carried out decontamination procedures. </p> <p>The man was admitted to the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas, where hours earlier Duncan<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan"> succumbed to the Ebola virus</a>, the hospital confirmed.<br /></p> <p>“Right now, there are more questions than answers about this case,” the hospial said in a statement. The Ebola test takes about 48 hours to return results.</p> <p>Based upon the “low risk” posed by the man, everyone in the urgent care waiting room was asked to monitor their health but allowed to leave. <br /></p> <p>Health officials are monitoring 48 people who may have come into contact with Duncan, only 10 of whom are considered “high risk” and under quarantine. The man admitted to the hospital on Wednesday was not one of the individuals being monitored, Piland said.</p> <p>Authorities were criticised last week for the time it took to decontaminate the apartment in which Duncan was staying, and their failure to lock it down to prevent unauthorised entries and exits.</p> <p>Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also said that this does not appear to be a case of Ebola. The deputy isn’t showing typical symptoms of the virus and never came in direct contact with Duncan.</p> <p>The head of the CDC, Thomas Frieden, urged hospitals to “think Ebola”, and respond quickly to patients who display symptoms of the disease and have the relevant travel history. </p> <p>Frieden said several ill people have been tested for Ebola due to the heightened awareness of the disease.</p> <p>“Right now there is only one patient who’s ever been diagnosed with Ebola in the US and that individual tragically died today,” he said on Wednesday. <br /></p> <p>Frieden said he is deeply saddened over Duncan’s death, and said it was a tragic reminder of the deadliness of this disease.</p> <p>“His is a fate that we associate now with Ebola,” Frieden said. “Since the start of the epidemic 3,742 patients in west Africa have been documented to have died from the disease. We don’t have their faces as prominently in front of us, and we know that even more people have been affected. But we think about this and we remember what a deadly enemy Ebola is.”<br /></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/us-airports-ebola-screenings-west-africa <p>Passengers travelling from west Africa will face additional Ebola screenings at five US airports, the White House said on Wednesday, amid mounting concern that not enough controls were in place to prevent the deadly disease from entering the US.<br /><br />The additional screenings will be carried out by personnel from US Customs and Border Protection, US Coast Guard and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Enhanced screenings will begin at John F Kennedy airport in New York on Saturday. They will begin next week at Liberty airport in Newark, New Jersey; Dulles, outside Washington DC; Chicago O’Hare, and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta.</p> <p>“These measures are really just belt-and-suspenders,” President Barack Obama told state and local officials on Wednesday. “It’s an added layer of protection on top of the procedures already in place at several airports.”</p> <p>Passengers flying from the disease-ravaged west African countries already face screenings at their departure airport which include temperature checks and questionnaires about their exposure history.</p> <p>White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said the five airports cover the destinations of 94% of passengers travelling to the US from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – the three west African countries worst affected by Ebola. He said about 150 people a day will face extra screenings.</p> <p>The news came as a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan">Dallas hospital announced the death</a> of the first man diagnosed with Ebola in the US. Thomas Eric Duncan travelled from Liberia to the US on 19 September. He did not disclose on a pre-flight questionnaire that he had come into contact with Ebola in Liberia.</p> <p>It is believed Duncan contracted the disease while helping take his landlord’s 19-year-old daughter to an Ebola treatment ward in Monrovia. She was turned away because the ward was full, and the young woman later died at home.<br /></p> <p>The US Department of Homeland Security deputy secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, said the administration is taking a “layered approach” to the Ebola screenings.</p> <p>Mayorkas said CBP agents have been directed to observe passengers for “overt signs of illnesses at all US ports of entry”. Agents will hand out factsheets to passengers travelling from the affected countries in west Africa that outline the signs and symptoms of the virus as well as what they should do if symptoms develop within the 21-day incubation period.<br /></p> <p>“We are also continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of potential additional measures to prevent the spread of Ebola across our borders, and will provide more details on those potential steps very shortly,” he said.</p> <p>Passengers arriving from the three most affected countries will be escorted by agents to an area of the airport set aside for screening, according to a fact sheet provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p> <p>CBP officers will ask the travellers a serious of health questions about their exposure to Ebola and trained medical personnel will take their temperature with an FDA-approved non-contact thermometer, CDC director Tom Frieden said at press conference on Wednesday afternoon. If travellers show signs of having Ebola or indicate they’ve had exposure to the disease, they will be placed at an airport quarantine station and evaluated.</p> <p>The administration has said repeatedly that it is not considering a ban on travel to or from the west African countries affected by the outbreak there, as it could exacerbate the situation and prevent desperately needed resources from reaching the region.<br /></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-gearing-up-uk-unlikely <p>Dozens of hospitals could end up isolating and treating patients suspected of having Ebola if a serious outbreak occurs in Britain, the NHS has said.</p> <p>All England’s major hospitals are making preparations in case they have to play a part in tackling the disease, not just the four centres specialising in control of infectious diseases which would take any initial flurry of patients.</p> <p>An NHS spokeswoman confirmed that all hospitals with the capacity to isolate patients, in siderooms or elsewhere, were “gearing up” for the possibility of receiving Ebola patients.</p> <p>It is not known exactly how many of England’s 160 acute hospital trusts have that capacity but it is thought to be the larger ones, totalling several dozen.</p> <p>If cases do emerge, the NHS’s plan is for patients to be initially taken to the Royal Free hospital in north London.</p> <p>It has the UK’s only high-level isolation unit used to treat people with highly infectious diseases. It is where British nurse Will Pooley – who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone – recovered from the disease in August and September after receiving the experimental drug ZMapp.</p> <p>Although the unit has only two beds, capacity there will be expanded as a first step, if the need arises, in order to utilise the skills and experience of its dedicated team of doctors, nurses and laboratory staff specialising in infectious diseases.</p> <p>But the hospital said it was “unlikely” that more than two patients would be admitted with Ebola at the same time.</p> <p>After that, the infectious diseases units at the Royal Liverpool hospitals, Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield and Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne would receive cases.</p> <p>They would be either cases that had emerged in their area or potentially patients brought from London because the Royal Free was already at capacity, according to one intensive care doctor.</p> <p>But “many” hospitals beyond those four could also play a part in treating Ebola, if enough cases emerged, the NHS England spokeswoman said.</p> <p>But doctors today stressed that they are not expecting cases of Ebola.</p> <p>Dr Nick Beeching, clinical director of the Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, said that his unit is on standby to assist the Royal Free in managing patients with Ebola. However, “while we are planning for this possibility we do not currently expect to care for any patients with confirmed Ebola. There is no risk to the general public and anybody coming to the Royal as a patient or visitor should not be concerned”, Beeching added.</p> <p>“The risk of Ebola arriving in the UK remains very low and it can only be caught through direct contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids [such as saliva or blood]”, said Dr David Throssell, medical director of the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.</p> <p>Its infectious diseases unit “is well-prepared with the equipment, facilities and specialists to deal with any cases of Ebola appropriately and safely”, he added.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the time is coming when the British government will have to start putting forward a “constructive public health message” to counter the potential threat from Ebola, <a href="http://youtu.be/yuxXxQi51R0">according to a doctor who has recently returned</a> from working in west Africa with people infected the disease.</p> <p>Benjamin Black, an obstetrician with Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) who has been working in Sierra Leone and is preparing to return, said that there had been much media attention on how the west could defend itself and paranoia around “the coming plague”.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: “That’s simply not the situation. When you talk about numbers of people who have been affected in the west it’s very small and it’s very unlikely that there is going to be any sort of widespread disease here.</p> <p>“However, I do think that there has been a lot of sensationalist material put out there and maybe the time is coming that the government tries to start putting forward a constructive public health message that prepares the population with the correct information because knowledge is power essentially and if you have the right knowledge then you can feel secure in yourself.”</p> <p>“The essence to a public health message would be to keep it simple. This is a viral infection, much like the way you talk about any other sort of viral infection … Ebola has slightly taken on a sort of mystical element. It’s not mystical. It’s a disease and [can be countered with] basic hygiene measures that we are very equipped with in this country – soap kills Ebola.</p> <p>“That is missing in some ways. People don’t realise that this is a weak virus. There needs to be direct bodily fluid contact and the reason why you have a situation as it is in west Africa is not based purely on the disease. It’s based on many more factors. It’s to do with social, economic, political general health infrastructure. What we have in the UK and what we have in the west is a completely different situation so I think that the general public should be educated and they should be well informed as well.”</p> <p>One of a number of volunteers taking part in a six-month trial of an Ebola vaccine at the Jenner Institute at Oxford University has also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7pegRADe2Y">speaking about his experience</a>. The vaccine Nick Owen has been given is called ChAd3, which uses a single benign Ebola virus protein (one seventh of the whole virus) to generate an immune response.</p> <p>It’s carried into the body by a vector, in this case a chimpanzee adenovirus – or, a common cold. He was deliberately given a virus as it gets inside cells and produces a particular type of immunity. A chimp virus is being used as people are often immune to human common colds, meaning the vaccine wouldn’t have a chance to begin to work. Essentially, it’s a process of tricking the immune system into thinking it has an infection.</p> <p>He said: “The day after I had the vaccine I felt a bit fluey and had a sore arm but by the evening I was absolutely fine. I think it’s a really small price to pay for what we can potentially get out of this vaccine if it’s going to prevent outbreaks of the magnitude we have seen so far this year.”</p> <p>Owen has been told that the clinical trial team will have early results in immunology by late October or early November, giving them guidance as to whether the vaccine can be used in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</p> <p>Dr Alison Pittard, a leading intensive care specialist, explains the NHS’s preparations for dealing with possible cases of Ebola.</p> <p>“Every NHS hospital trust has put in place guidance and protocols for what should be done if patients arrive with suspected Ebola … The main symptom is a fever of unknown origin in someone who has recently travelled in a high-risk area or has been close to a person suspected to have Ebola. All NHS staff now know, if you have a patient like that, you should ask: ‘is this Ebola?’.</p> <p>This will not be something that any doctor or nurse has ever seen before. But it will need to be a diagnosis that’s at the front of everyone’s minds.</p> <p>Trusts have made every member of staff aware of this, not just intensive care staff. The NHS and Public Health England want everybody to be vigilant.</p> <p>A patient with Ebola may come in through an A&amp;E unit, or be referred by their GP to a hospital respiratory clinic, or they may already be an inpatient but with another illness.</p> <p>If there’s a suspected case, the first priority is to isolate them in a sideroom, using staff in facemasks and bodysuits, and then seek advice about what to do next.</p> <p>All acute hospital trusts have an infectious diseases department and every intensive care unit will be able to isolate patients to varying degrees. And all hospitals have personal protective equipment.</p> <p>But the four hospitals that specialise in infectious diseases and have higher levels of isolation will have all the necessary clothing, from gowns to facemasks and protective suits and masks.</p> <p>Because of the complexity of dealing with Ebola, it’s sensible to concentrate the care of patients at a few hospitals with the relevant expertise to deal with them.</p> <p>All the systems have been put in place to deal with patients appearing with suspected Ebola. But until we are faced with patients we don’t know if the preparations are adequate or not.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-spanish-health-workers-poor-training-virus <p>Spanish health professionals have taken aim at the scant amount of training offered to those on the frontline fighting the Ebola virus as the investigation continues into how a Spanish nurse became the first known person to contract the disease outside of west Africa.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the doctor treating Ebola patient Teresa Romero Ramos said the infection might have been caused by “an accident” when the 44-year-old was taking off her protective equipment.</p> <p>Germán Ramírez said he had spoken to the nurse three times in an effort to home in how she got infected. Romero Ramos, he said, believes she might have touched her face with her gloves while she was taking off her protective equipment.</p> <p>In an interview from her hospital bed, Romero Ramos told Spanish broadcaster Cuatro that while she had been given training on how to put on and take off the protective equipment, it was “little training”. She refused to give more details.</p> <p>Her interview came as the number of patients in quarantine at Madrid’s Carlos III hospital rose to six. Along with Romero Ramos and her husband, patients include three nurses who attended to the missionaries and a man who had travelled to Spain from Nigeria.</p> <p>Initial tests indicate that one of the nurses and the traveller are both free from Ebola.</p> <p>Despite the growing number of patients, health workers said they had had little preparation to deal with Ebola. For Amelia Batanero, a nurse at Madrid’s La Paz hospital, the call to attend to the growing number of Ebola patients could come any day now as she is on the rotation list to work at the Carlos III hospital.</p> <p>This, in spite of the fact that she has never stepped foot in the hospital or that her only training took place months ago. “We haven’t learned how to use these suits, we don’t know the protocol on how to treat Ebola,” she said.</p> <p>In July she was part of a group of nurses in Madrid who brought a complaint before a judge over their “lack of training and knowledge regarding Ebola protocols”.</p> <p>Dr Santiago Yus, a specialist in intensive care, echoed Batanero’s concerns, telling El Mundo that he would likely be treating Ebola patients in the coming days. “I’m not ready, I’m not trained,” he said.</p> <p>The doctor, who has more than 30 years experience, said he had only been given a few 10-minute briefings months before and further questions had been directed to photographs on the wall explaining how to put on and take off the protective suit. This week, he was part of a group of 15 health workers who met with hospital management to warn them about their lack of preparation in facing Ebola.</p> <p>As the training was given during the summer, many health professionals were away on vacation, said Alda Recas of AME, an association of nurses in Madrid. “When some people came back from their vacations, they were told they would have to take care of the missionaries. They would call you an hour, or half an hour, before their shift to show you how to put on the protective gear.”</p> <p>The situation is far worse at the Alcorcón hospital, where health workers never expected to be on the frontline of an Ebola outbreak, said one worker who declined to be named. “We don’t even have the required safety level at this hospital to take on Ebola.”</p> <p>On Monday, a screen and security tape made up the makeshift isolation unit for Romero Ramos while she was being tested. Doctors refused to confirm to her that she had twice tested positive for Ebola. As the nurse explained in her interview with Cuatro, “I asked the doctor for the result and he didn’t want to give it to me. Nobody told me anything.” She eventually learned that she was infected with Ebola after checking news headlines on a mobile phone.</p> <p>Days after Romero Ramos was transferred to the Carlos III hospital, the zone where she was treated in the Alcorcón hospital remains untouched. Cleaning staff have refused to clean the area, arguing that they don’t have the right equipment or training to deal with the cleanup.</p> <p>As the contracting company hastily attempts to meet their demands, a plastic curtain has been placed over the area. “We might be able to go into there on Thursday,” said one worker.</p> <p>The blame for the varied response, said Roberto Tornamira of the workers’ union Fes-UGT-Madrid, lay with the Spanish health ministry as each hospital had been left to create a protocol on treating Ebola on its own. Calling it an “incredible” lapse of responsibility by health authorities, he noted that the lack of uniformity could have far-reaching consequences. “If this were to become an outbreak in Spain, it means each hospital would treat the virus in a different way.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, dozens of animal rights activists scuffled with police outside the apartment complex where Romero Ramos and her husband live, trying to stop workers from taking away their dog, Excalibur. Protesters briefly halted a police van as it pulled away with the family pet inside, but police with batons cleared a path.</p> <p>Madrid’s regional government later said the animal had been sedated, euthanised and incinerated. Authorities had obtained a court order to kill the dog, saying they could not rule out the possibility Excalibur could spread the virus.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/spanish-ebola-nurse-symptoms-quarantine <p>A Spanish nurse who was admitted to hospital in Madrid with the Ebola virus, after treating a repatriated patient who later died of the illness, had told health authorities at least three times that she had a fever before she was placed in quarantine.</p> <p>Teresa Romero Ramos is the first person in the current outbreak to have caught the virus outside of west Africa.</p> <p>Her first contact with health authorities was on 30 September when she complained of a slight fever and fatigue. Romero Ramos called a specialised service dedicated to occupational risk at the Carlos III hospital where she worked and had treated an Ebola patient, said Antonio Alemany from the regional government of Madrid. But as the nurse’s fever had not reached 38.6C, she was advised to visit her local clinic where she was reportedly prescribed paracetamol.</p> <p>Days later, according to El País newspaper, Romero Ramos called the hospital again to complain about her fever. No action was taken.</p> <p>On Monday, she called the Carlos III hospital again, this time saying she felt terrible. Rather than transport her to the hospital that had treated the two missionaries who had been repatriated with Ebola, Romero Ramos was instructed to call emergency services and head to the hospital closest to her home. She was transported to the Alcorcón hospital by paramedics who were not wearing protective gear, El País reported.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="bcbd1394256121deb50440bf8189c90a398eb6e5"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412774203919/e8ef77ae-74e2-44e2-9519-f3b7b5351e83-460x276.jpeg" alt="Isolation measures at Hospital Alcorcon - an image widely shared on social media from an anonymous source at the hospital" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Isolation measures at Alcorcón - an image widely shared on social media from an anonymous source at the hospital</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Anonymous</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On arrival at the hospital, Romero Ramos warned staff that she feared she had contracted Ebola. Despite the warning, she remained in a bed in the emergency room while she waited for her test results. She was separated from other patients only by curtains, hospital staff said on Tuesday.</p> <p>Fernando Simón, coordinator of the centre of alerts and emergencies at Spain’s health ministry, said it might have been better to have admitted Romero Ramos to hospital when she first made contact. Romero Ramos, 44, and her husband, Javier Limón Romero, remain in quarantine.</p> <p>Germán Ramírez, the doctor attending to Romero Ramos, said the nurse may have contracted the virus when she was taking off her protective equipment.</p> <p>He said he had spoken to her several times and she had suggested she may have touched her face with her gloves while taking off her protective suit. He added that health professionals were supervised whenever they were taking off or putting on their protective equipment.</p> <p>Spanish authorities say they are monitoring another 50 people for symptoms of Ebola. The list includes other members of the team who attended to the missionaries as well as the healthcare professionals who assisted Romero Ramos at the Alcorcón hospital.</p> <p>On Tuesday evening, five patients were being monitored for Ebola at the Carlos III hospital, after another nurse who assisted the missionaries was admitted. A man who travelled from Nigeria and another nurse from the same team, both of whom initially tested negative for the virus, remain in isolation.</p> <p>In <a href="http://www.elmundo.es/madrid/2014/10/08/54346601e2704e35598b4571.html" title="">an interview with El Mundo from her hospital bed</a>, Romero Ramos said she believed she had followed nursing protocols while caring for the infected patient. She said she “didn’t have the slightest clue” as to how she had contracted the virus and rejected any insinuation of human error. She said she was feeling “a little better”.</p> <p>In the Alcorcón neighbourhood where Romero Ramos and her husband live, approximately 30 residents have called the city council’s helpline for more information. Beset with worries over having shared lifts and other public spaces with the couple, neighbours complained to Spanish media that they had yet to receive any guidance from health authorities.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, called for calm as he promised “total transparency in giving all the information that could be given” on the outbreak.</p> <p>He described the Spanish healthcare system as “one of the best in the world” and asked that “health professionals, who have a proven reputation, be left to do their work”.</p> <p>Along with explaining how the contagion occurred, Rajoy said the priority was “to attend to the patient and monitor all of those who have had contact … We will overcome this.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-patient-dies-texas-thomas-eric-duncan <p>Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient to be diagnosed with Ebola outside Africa, died on Wednesday, the Texas hospital that was treating him announced.</p> <p>“It is with profound sadness and heartfelt disappointment that we must inform you of the death of Thomas Eric Duncan this morning,” the Texas Health Presbyterian hospital said in a statement.</p> <p>Duncan, 42, died at 7.51am local time, according to the hospital<strong>. </strong>“Mr Duncan succumbed to an insidious disease, Ebola. He fought courageously in this battle. Our professionals, the doctors and nurses in the unit, as well as the entire Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas community, are also grieving his passing. We have offered the family our support and condolences at this difficult time,” the statement said.</p> <p>Late last month, Duncan became the first patient to be diagnosed in the US with the virus, the current outbreak of which has killed more than 3,400 people in west Africa, including in his native Liberia.</p> <p>David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas department of state health services, expressed condolences for Duncan’s family. “The past week has been an enormous test of our health system, but for one family it has been far more personal. Today they lost a dear member of their family. They have our sincere condolences, and we are keeping them in our thoughts. </p> <p>“The doctors, nurses and staff at Presbyterian provided excellent and compassionate care, but Ebola is a disease that attacks the body in many ways. We’ll continue every effort to contain the spread of the virus and protect people from this threat.”</p> <p>Texas officials said Duncan’s body will be cremated in accordance with guidlines developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) for handling infected bodies. Ebola victims’ bodies are the most contagious immediately after their death. <br /><br />The body will be enclosed in two bags for transportation. Once the body is placed inside the bags, protective gear is not necessary for anyone who is not handling the body. <br /><br />Lakey said he visited the family and explained to them personally that the state recommended cremating the body for public health reasons and the family agreed.<br /><br />“This is a difficult time for the family, and our thoughts are with them,” Lakey said in an afternoon statement. “We will continue to treat Mr Duncan with dignity and respect, and we’re taking great care to make sure there is no additional risk that others could be infected.”</p> <p>The Dallas Independent School District said in a statement that it is “saddened to learn of Mr Thomas Duncan’s passing” and that schools would make counselling services available to the students and staff affected by his death. Five school-age children were pulled from classes and are under observation.</p> <p>Duncan travelled from Liberia to the US on 19 September to reunite with his girlfriend, Louise Troh, the mother of his son, Karsiah. After falling ill, Duncan was first turned away from hospital, before being admitted two days later when he became more seriously sick.</p> <p>He was brought by ambulance to Texas Health Presbyterian on 28 September, where he was admitted and placed in isolation. Troh and three members of her family were placed under quarantine, where they must remain until 19 October, the end of their 21-day incubation. They were moved from their Dallas apartment on Friday to an undisclosed location in the city.</p> <p>Duncan’s Ebola diagnosis was confirmed last Tuesday and his condition worsened over the weekend. His liver function declined, he was placed on dialysis and was breathing through a respirator. The hospital had begun treating Duncan with the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/06/nbc-photojournalist-diagnosed-ebola-nebraska">experimental antiviral drug</a> brincidofovir.</p> <p>The way the hospital initially handled Duncan on his first visit has raised questions over hospitals’ preparedness for treating the disease, and prompted the CDC to update its guidelines for healthcare facilities around the country. </p> <p>Duncan’s girlfriend and her family are under quarantine at an undisclosed location, after being moved from their apartment on Friday.</p> <p>Officials are monitoring 10 people believed to have had direct contact with Duncan, including four who were sharing an apartment with him when he became ill. Another 38 people who may have had contact with Duncan, but who are considered to be at much lower risk, are also being monitored. So far none has displayed symptoms of the virus.</p> <p>It’s believed that Duncan contracted the disease while helping his landlord take their 19-year-old daughter to an Ebola treatment ward in Monrovia. Convulsing and seven months pregnant, the young woman was turned away from the overcrowded hospital apparently because it lacked the space to treat her. Duncan helped the girl’s family take her home again, where she died hours later.</p> <p>The young woman’s brother began showing symptoms of the virus around the same time as Duncan. The brother, however, died days later on the way to hospital in Monrovia.</p> <p>Duncan did not declare that he had been in contact with Ebola when he completed a pre-flight questionnaire at Monrovia airport before travelling to the US. The White House on Wednesday <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/us-airports-ebola-screenings-west-africa">tightened up procedures</a> for monitoring people arriving in the US from west Africa, where the disease is prevalent.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the civil rights leader Rev Jesse Jackson travelled to Dallas to pray with Duncan’s family, who came from North Carolina. The family was able to glimpse their ill relative through the hospital’s camera system.<br /></p> <p>“I just came by here because I feel like God was calling me to come see my dad,” said Karsiah Duncan, 19, speaking at at a news conference on Tuesday night hosted by a Dallas church. Karsiah hadn’t seen his father since he was three years old. </p> <p>Duncan’s half sister, Mai Wureh, said he planned to marry Louise, Karsiah’s mother, and apply for permanent status to remain in the US with his family.</p> <p>Stanley Gaye, president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, told the Guardian that Duncan’s death had come as a shock as he was hopeful that the patient would pull through. “My spirit has been broken. I’m disappointed, I was hoping for the best, I didn’t think it was coming to this,” Gaye said.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/british-troops-sent-fight-ebola-sierra-leone <p>Britain is to deploy 600 extra military personnel to Sierra Leone next week to help combat Ebola.</p> <p>They will join 150 already in place and will be backed up by a ship, planes and helicopters.</p> <p>The decision was made at a meeting of Cobra, the government’s national emergencies committee, in Downing Street on Wednesday, where David Cameron was reassured by his officials that the risk to public health in the UK remains low.</p> <p>He was briefed by Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, and Dr Paul Cosford, the head of Public Health England, who said training on how to deal with suspected Ebola cases had already been given to ambulance medics, hospitals, NHS 111, GPs and other key public health workers. Information posters for passengers on recognising the signs of Ebola will also be put up in UK airports.</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman said: “The case of Will Pooley had demonstrated the UK’s ability to deal with an identified case without wider infection, with a world-leading specialist unit at The Royal Free hospital.</p> <p>“Contingency planning would continue and will include a national exercise and wider resilience training to ensure the UK is fully prepared. The chief medical officer has now issued further advice to medical professionals across the country and would continue to do so in the coming weeks.”</p> <p>Pooley contracted Ebola while working as a nurse in Sierra leone and was flown back to the UK and treated successfully at the Royal Free hospital in north London.</p> <p>The Cobra discussion covered both preparations for dealing with Ebola in the UK and the UK’s work tackling the health crisis in West Africa.</p> <p>The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, describing the Ebola outbreak as a global threat, said: “We are stepping up significantly the UK’s contribution and leadership in work to tackle the outbreak, on land, in the air and at sea.”</p> <p>Much of the focus of the deployment is helping to establish Ebola treatment centres and an Ebola training academy.</p> <p>“We are deploying troops, helicopters and a ship - army medics and Merlin helicopters, supported by Royal Fleet Auxiliary Argus - to provide direct support and reassurance.”</p> <p>They will reinforce engineers and planes already on the ground constructing the Kerry Town Ebola treatment unit. They will help in the training of healthcare workers, hygienists and others at a World Health Organisation Ebola training centre, including 200 military personnel to help run the site.</p> <p>Three Navy Merlin helicopters and crew plus engineers will be sent to move staff around. The Argus will be used in support as a forward operating base for the helicopters.</p> <p>The department of international development is taking the lead in the British effort, which includes a commitment to build at least four new Ebola treatment facilities with a total of 700 beds near Port Loko, Freetown, Makeni and Bo.</p> <p>The extra personnel announced on Wednesday will also help support Sierra Leone’s over-stretched public health service, with the aim of helping up to 9,000 patients over a six-month period.</p> <p>Military personnel will deploy to Sierra Leone next week where they will join military engineers and planners who have been in the country for almost a month, overseeing the construction of the medical facilities.</p> <p>Philippa Tuckman, a military injuries claims solicitor, said: “This is a high risk deployment. We must hope that the training and medical support provided to British troops is adequate to protect them from the virus and only time will tell whether sufficient provision has been put in place. The MoD would not want to find itself faced with serious questions about whether it is properly protecting its soldiers from this disease.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/-sp-ebola-west-africa-health-workers <p>The day, 21 July, began like any other Monday for Ameyo Adadevoh, a doctor in Africa’s most populous city, Lagos. In a crowded midtown district, the usual jumble of patients awaited at the hospital where Adadevoh was known to sometimes give free drugs to those who could not afford it. Among them was<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/first-ebola-case-diagnosed-us-man-flew-liberia" title=""> a patient who had been wheeled in the previous evening</a>, feverish and vomiting, diagnosed with severe malaria.</p> <p>In fact, Liberian-American civil servant Patrick Sawyer had slipped through three layers of security – a quarantine order, and airport checks in Liberia and Nigeria – intended to stem an outbreak in three west African countries. Within 24 hours, he became Nigeria’s Ebola patient zero, the small hospital was forced to become a makeshift Ebola ward, and Adadevoh, an endocrinologist, found herself thrust into the role of stopping the disease’s spread in the continent’s most populous country.</p> <p>That Nigeria has so far emerged relatively unscathed from its brush with Ebola owes much to the quick-thinking staff at an ordinary family clinic, who put themselves in the firing line for six days before the government was ready to relocate him. And, as elsewhere in this epidemic, those on the frontline paid the highest price: four of the seven fatalities were health workers, including Adadevoh.</p> <p>“We tried everything we could. Any way we could get her out, any medicine; everybody was trying,” said her son, Bankole. “The saddest part is that she stayed here in Nigeria to run a health centre people could trust, and it’s the Nigerian system that let her down in the end.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image element--supporting" data-media-id="0620c80275806d658c9a94e90a767041fc6bc378"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412775812589/304bb465-7047-42e4-8040-95b3c273c13d-460x276.jpeg" alt="A local paper carries news of the death of Ameyo Adadevoh." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">A local paper carries news of the death of Ameyo Adadevoh.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Sunday Alamba/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even in specially equipped isolation wards, the slightest slip-ups – whether through poor equipment or inadequate training – can be deadly. Health authorities in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-crisis-substandard-equipment-nurse-positive-spain" title="">Spain blamed substandard equipment for the infection of a nurse </a>this week in Europe’s first recorded case.</p> <p>But while isolated cases will always be a risk even in advanced healthcare systems, overwhelmed hospitals in west Africa have become places of horror for patients and doctors alike. As the epidemic has exposed weak healthcare systems and leaderships in disarray, leaving nearly 3,500 dead in its wake, far more might have died if not for many local health workers soldiering on armed with little more than conviction and courage.</p> <p>This week, the bodies of Ebola victims were dumped in the streets when <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/04/ebola-kailahun-sierra-leone-burial-boys-west-africa" title="">burial teams</a> went on strike over pay, the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation said. Health ministry spokesman Sidie Yahya Tunis said the situation was “very embarrassing” and that money was available to pay the teams.</p> <p>But recently an ambulance driver at Sierra Leone’s colonial-built Connaught hospital offloaded a suspected Ebola patient wearing only a plastic apron for protection. A trail of water flowed out of the open isolation unit door into corridors lined with posters of nurses and doctors who had died of the disease. “We really don’t have the equipment to feel 100% secure, but what else can we do? We need to help these people,” the ambulance driver said as he hosed himself down later.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="b86b79b8f496529adf16583a09fbeec4d169dcc7"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412776075462/3edae2ba-d131-4c6e-8b29-de5a20136194-460x276.jpeg" alt="Grave diggers prepare for new Ebola victims outside an Ebola treatment centre near Gbarnga, central Liberia." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Grave diggers prepare for new Ebola victims outside an Ebola treatment centre near Gbarnga, central Liberia.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To safely manage a treatment centre of 70 beds, the World Health Organisation estimates that at least 200 medical staff are needed, of whom roughly a fifth should be foreign doctors who provide training and supervision. A belated surge of international aid has included engineers, medical kit and money, but boots on the ground are still lacking. Médecins sans Frontières, the non-governmental organisation leading efforts, said it opened its doors in Liberia for 30 minutes each day just to fill the number of beds vacated by survivors or the dead. Another western health NGO said <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/aid-agencies-fail-to-mobilize-ebola-resources/article20930983/#dashboard/follows/" title="">fewer than 10 US doctors had volunteered</a>, compared with more than 400 during the 2010 Haiti crisis.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the private grief of the families of more than 240 public health workers who have died has also had an alarming public impact: it removes pillars in already fragile health systems, shrinking the pool of talent from which to rebuild devastated healthcare systems when international organisations leave.</p> <p>Nigeria’s success shows how a determined response can nip an epidemic in the bud, despite early official inertia. Home to the village that gave Lassa fever – a haemorrhagic fever similar to Ebola and endemic in the region – its name, Africa’s largest economy did not have a single functional isolation ward when Ebola struck six months into the west African epidemic.</p>  <figure class="element element-image element--supporting" data-media-id="9529d8932f1cc7cdda0d36f144330c8dc5825c47"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412776264353/251f554f-8e1d-498e-8bfe-474f5add226d-460x276.jpeg" alt="A microbiologist prepares to test blood samples for Ebola at a US navy mobile laboratory in central Liberia, part of the American response to the epidemic." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">A microbiologist prepares to test blood samples for Ebola at a US navy mobile laboratory in central Liberia, part of the American response to the epidemic.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So Adadevoh set up aggressive barrier nursing, organised the disinfection of the hospital, and downloaded and distributed Ebola factsheets. For six days, the clinic’s staff effectively ran an Ebola isolation unit with no government help. When Liberian presidential officials called to insist Sawyer be released to attend a conference – he was a high-ranking civil servant – the hospital refused to let him go. And when an isolation ward was finally set up, Adadevoh visited even as other doctors refused to volunteer to staff it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the authorities’ slow revving into action eventually produced remarkable results. Drawing on a polio-surveillance system, health workers made 18,000 visits to 900 people to check the temperatures of possible contacts.</p> <p>In August, Adadevoh arrived at the isolation centre she had lobbied to improve. Eleven days after she died, Nigeria recorded its last Ebola case. “If anything comes of this, all we want is an improvement in healthcare, especially public healthcare, in Nigeria,” her son said.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the slow trickle of workers to replace exhausted international and local volunteers continues to take a devastating toll. Sierra Leone’s population of 6 million is served by about 120 doctors; those who have succumbed include the only haemorrhagic fever specialist. In Liberia, which has one doctor for every 70,000 people, the chief medical officer placed herself under quarantine after her office assistant died of Ebola this month.</p> <p>The outbreak first began in Guinea in December, but it took two months to identify the unfamiliar illness ravaging isolated communities, where there is one doctor per 10,000 inhabitants. By the time Ebola made its blood-soaked landfall in neighbouring Sierra Leone, most health workers at the Kenema government hospital fled. Not so Sheikh Umar Khan.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="848e892a5aeb025641dc437b46cb78c021493d59"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412776668604/04bbd9f1-ed7d-45df-a9e6-fae44cf56670-460x276.jpeg" alt="File photo of Sheikh Umar Khan, left, at an Ebola centre in Kenema.

He was finding it very difficult to get young colleagues to come in to work,” said <a href="http://wellbodyalliance.org/story/drbarriesstory/" title="">Mohamed Barrie</a>, a close friend of Khan’s since they met at medical school, and himself just one of three doctors serving a population of almost 600,000 in neighbouring Kono.</p> <p>Barrie last saw Khan at the ministry of health in June, where he was lobbying on behalf of health workers striking over unpaid salaries and dire working conditions. “He was trying to encourage the ministry on what they needed to do to build up trust and get doctors back in,” said Barrie. “It’s not easy in Sierra Leone. You work all these years without even running water in hospitals, and then you see a more junior doctor go into government and suddenly they’re building a house and have a new car.”</p> <p>Sierra Leone ranks 119th out of 177 on <a href="http://www.transparency.org/country#SLE" title="">Transparency International’s corruption index</a> and abiding suspicion towards officials meant many originally dismissed Ebola as a government hoax to plunder public coffers. Khan could not have foreseen that his own death would mark a turning point, as ordinary citizens finally accepted that a disease that felled one of the country’s most admired doctors had to be real.</p> <p>Ironically, Sierra Leone and Liberia invested the highest percentage of GDP on health in sub-Saharan Africa in 2012, at 15.1% and 15.5% respectively.</p> <p>But trust in the sector had been deeply eroded after a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ernest-bai-koroma/sierra-leone-fhci-the-free-health-care-init_b_1473835.html" title="">free maternal healthcare programme</a> intended to lift the country from the bottom of global indexes had been beset by doctors and nurses secretly charging money.

http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/08/world-bank-warns-ebola-economic-impact-west-africa <p>The outbreak of Ebola could cost the West African economy $32.6bn (£20.3bn) by the end of 2015 unless the epidemic is quickly contained,<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2014/10/08/ebola-new-world-bank-group-study-forecasts-billions-in-economic-loss-if-epidemic-lasts-longer-spreads-in-west-africa" title="">the World Bank has warned</a>.</p> <p>The Bank said the future path of Ebola was highly uncertain and failure to adequately contain the virus would have potentially catastrophic consequences for the economy.</p> <p>More than 3,400 people have died after contracting Ebola in the three most greatly affected countries: Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, said the virus posed a global threat and urged the international community to respond decisively.</p> <p>“With Ebola’s potential to inflict massive economic costs on Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and the rest of their neighbours in West Africa, the international community must find ways to get past logistical roadblocks and bring in more doctors and trained medical staff, more hospital beds, and more health and development support to help stop Ebola in its tracks,” he said.</p> <p>“The international community now must act on the knowledge that weak public health infrastructure, institutions, and systems in many fragile countries are a threat not only to their own citizens but also to their trading partners and the world at large.</p> <p>“The enormous economic cost of the current outbreak to the affected countries and the world could have been avoided by prudent ongoing investment in health systems-strengthening.”</p> <p>The Bank said it was generating $400m in emergency financing for the three countries hardest-hit by the crisis. It said that successful containment of Ebola in Nigeria and Senegal was evidence that it is possible to limit the spread of the virus with existing health system capacity and a resolute policy response.</p> <p>It added that the economic impact of the outbreak could be limited if action was taken now to stop the epidemic and the “aversion fear” which had driven neighbouring countries to close their borders, and airlines and other regional and international companies to suspend their commercial activities in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>The Bank said that after the epidemic had been contained, effort would be needed to continue work to strengthen an early warning network for the virus and encourage investments in health systems.</p> <p>“Taken together, the containment effort, the fiscal support, the restoration of investor confidence, and the expanded disease surveillance, diagnostic and treatment capacity promise to first stem the Ebola epidemic, and then help to reverse as quickly as possible the aversion behaviour that is causing so much economic damage,” it noted in a report.</p> <p>Fears are mounting about the spread of Ebola beyond West Africa after a nurse in Spain contracted the virus. UK investor confidence was hit by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-fears-alcorcon-hospital-spain" title="">the news from Spain</a>, sending shares in holiday and airline companies tumbling for a second day on fears that the arrival of the virus in Europe will hit travel and tourism.</p> <p>On Tuesday, around £1.6bn was wiped off the stock market value of holiday and travel groups and shares in the sector extended their falls on Wednesday.</p> <p>Tui Travel dropped 2.5% while shares in easyJet were 1% lower. British Airways’ parent company, International Airlines Group, and the cruise company Carnival also lost about 1%.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation has said it is ready to provide support for Spain as the authorities attempt to contain the first case of Ebola infection within Europe. The Spanish nurse, who is in quarantine, helped care for two elderly Spanish missionaries who died after being evacuated to Madrid for treatment.</p> <p>More than 12 million British nationals visit Spain each year.</p> <p>Tony Shepard, an analyst at Charles Stanley, said easyJet was the second biggest airline at Paris airports behind Air France and that France was the European country most exposed to Ebola because of its links to West Africa. IAG owns Iberia, which could face problems if the Spanish travel market dips.</p> <p>The airlines are stronger than they were in 2003, when the Sars virus hit routes in Asia, because Sars arrived at the same time as the Iraq war and high fuel prices, Shepard said.</p> <p>But he added: “Health concerns are one of the many factors which can affect the demand for air travel ... although Ebola has had no impact on the financial results of the airlines to date, it is possible to envisage a situation where the disease gets out of control. If investors want to take safety precautions they could lighten holdings.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/texas-ebola-patient-condition-improves-critical <p>Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=UOAyVLCHB4PX8gXtloKgCg&amp;ved=0CAYQFjAB&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNFeQtadTQJ_vYLf1Du685IspCGXnQ">Ebola</a> in the US, is in critical but stable condition, Texas Health Presbyterian hospital said on Tuesday. Duncan, who is being treated with the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/06/nbc-photojournalist-diagnosed-ebola-nebraska">experimental drug</a> brincidofovir, is on a ventilator to support his breathing and is receiving dialysis, the hospital said.<br /></p> <p>In a statement, the hospital said that Duncan’s liver function – which had worsened over the weekend – has improved slightly, but it warned that doctors believe “this could vary in coming days”. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a hospital in Nebraska is using the same drug to treat an American journalist who contracted Ebola while covering the outbreak in Liberia. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/06/nbc-cameraman-ashoka-mukpo-ebola-parents-video">Ashoka Mukpo</a>, a freelance cameraman who was working for NBC News, landed in Omaha on Monday, becoming the fifth American to be flown from the region to the US for treatment. In <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/threat-to-dog-spanish-nurse-ebola-sparks-online-petition">Spain</a>, health officials announced on Monday that a nurse had become the first person to contract the deadly virus outside of Africa, the same day Médecins Sans Frontières confirmed that a Norwegian staffer had tested positive for Ebola. </p> <p>The current outbreak has ravaged the west African countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leona, killing more than 3,400 people. It is devastating <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-ebola-crisis-briefing">fragile healthcare systems</a> and threatening economic stability in affected states.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/06/ebola-airport-screening-passengers-us-cities-obama">officials</a> are preparing to roll out tougher Ebola screening requirements at airports this week, amid calls for a travel ban. </p> <p>CDC director Tom Frieden said the public health agency would announce in the coming days new measures meant to detect signs of Ebola in passengers traveling to the US. The additional passenger screenings will be implemented at airports in the US and abroad. <strong><strong><br /></strong></strong></p> <p>Airline passengers departing the west African countries that are at the center of the outbreak already undergo temperature checks and are asked to fill out a questionnaire that asks about exposure to Ebola. As of this weekend, Frieden said these measures had stopped 77 people from boarding flights destined for US cities. </p> <p>This protocol was followed in the case of Duncan, who traveled to Dallas from Liberia last month. His temperature was normal when he departed Monrovia. Duncan, however, did not disclose on the questionnaire that he had been exposed to an Ebola sufferer, his landlord’s daughter, who died from the disease hours after she was turned away from an overcrowded hospital for lack of space. Duncan helped her family transport her to the hospital, and home again. </p> <p>Following Duncan’s diagnosis, some Republican lawmakers have called for blanket bans on passengers travelling from the affected parts of Africa.</p> <p>Administration and healthcare officials have repeatedly said that a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/british-airways-hampering-ebola-aid-effort-west-africa-agencies">travel ban could exacerbate the situation</a> in Africa by constricting the flow of aid into the region. Frieden has said isolating the region could increase the risk to other countries, including the US. “We … don’t want to do anything that will backfire,” he said.</p> <p>After Duncan was diagnosed a week ago, health officials in Dallas immediately traced everyone he had come into contact with since arriving in Texas. Officials are currently monitoring 10 people who are believed to have had direct contact with Duncan, including four who were sharing an apartment with him when he became ill. Another 38 people who may have come into contact with Duncan are also being monitored, but are considered to be at much lower risk, Frieden said on Tuesday. Symptoms appear on average eight to 10 days after exposure, which means this week is a very sensitive time for the 48 people under observation. So far none have showed signs of having contracted the disease.</p> <p>Hospitals across the country are also taking note of the Dallas case and ramping up their response efforts by retraining staff and refining infection control procedures. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Texas health commissioner Dr David Lakey encouraged hospital staff and medical workers to be on alert for ill patients who have recently travelled to west Africa. “You can’t diagnose this disease unless you think about this disease,” Lakey said. </p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/ebola-what-is-risk-in-uk <h2>What is the risk of Ebola in the UK?</h2> <p><br /></p> <p>According to professor David Heymann, chairman of Public Health England (PHE), the risk of Ebola to Britain remains low. “There is certainly not a crisis in the UK at this time. The UK is prepared, having prepared over many, many years to deal with events such as this,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ebola-public-health-questions-and-answers" title="">PHE says UK</a> contingency plans for Ebola have always been based on the assumption that there is a low risk of importing the occasional case of Ebola from west Africa. “However, it is important to remember that, even if a case is identified here, the UK has robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases,” it says.</p> <h2>What precautions are being taken in the UK?</h2> <p><br />Four major NHS hospitals are on standby to deal with a possible Ebola outbreak. The hospitals have infectious disease units and, according to the latest guidance from NHS England officials, they are prepared to provide “surge capacity” if the virus spreads to Britain. London’s Royal Free hospital – where nurse William Pooley was successfully treated after contracting the virus in Sierra Leone – has the most sophisticated specialist high-level isolation unit in the UK, with two containment beds. Under NHS plans, further specialist equipment would be transferred from the Royal Free to units in Sheffield, Newcastle and Liverpool in the event of a larger outbreak. The NHS England operational update, issued in September, states: “A letter has now gone out to the chief executives of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen university hospital NHS foundation trust, Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals NHS foundation trust and Sheffield teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust as part of a contingency plan to support a national surge.”</p> <h2>Are these precautions adequate?</h2> <p><br />Professor Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and part of the team that discovered Ebola, says rich countries such as Britain and the US – <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/texas-ebola-patient-condition-improves-critical" title="">where a man is being treated for the virus</a> after returning from Liberia – have robust infection-control measures and clinical practices to stop its spread. Health services, says Piot, are well equipped to isolate the patient, to trace everyone he or she has been in contact with, and to put those contacts under surveillance for signs of fever.</p> <h2>What happens with an Ebola patient?</h2> <p><br /><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-europe-unavoidable-who-spain" title="">Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at PHE, said</a>: “If an Ebola case is repatriated to, or detected in, the UK they would receive appropriate treatment in an isolation unit, with all appropriate protocols promptly activated. Protective measures would be strictly maintained to minimise risk of transmission to healthcare workers treating the individual. It is important to remember that for Ebola to be transmitted from one person to another, contact with blood or other body fluids is needed. As such, if England was to see a case of Ebola this will not result in an outbreak here.”</p> <h2>What happened in Spain?</h2> <p><br />A <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/06/nurse-spain-tests-positive-ebola" title="">Spanish nurse tested positive for Ebola </a>on Monday, the first person known to have contracted the virus outside west Africa. She was part of a team that cared for two elderly Spanish missionaries who died after being evacuated to Madrid for treatment. Her case has been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-crisis-substandard-equipment-nurse-positive-spain" title="">blamed on substandard equipment and a failure to follow protocol</a>. Staff at the hospital where she worked told El País newspaper that the protective suits they were given did not meet World Health Organisation (WHO) standards, which specify that suits must be impermeable and include breathing apparatus. For Piot, the case underlines how the smallest mistake can be fatal. “For example, a very dangerous moment is when you come out of the isolation unit you take off your protective gear, you are full of sweat and so on,” he <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29531671" title="">told the BBC</a>. Piot said he was not surprised by the case in Madrid and expected more incidents in Europe and the US, although he did not expect to see the illness spread as rapidly as it had in Africa.</p> <h2>Should arrivals be screened at British ports and airports?</h2> <p><br />The WHO recommends screening for people with unexplained illnesses leaving Ebola-affected countries, but entry screening is not recommended. It would have to involve screening every returning traveller, because people could travel through a third country. Dr Paul Cosford, director of health protection at PHE, said: “The risk of travellers and people working in affected countries contracting Ebola remains low, but PHE continues to keep border staff and medical practitioners informed, and request they remain vigilant for unexplained illness in those who have visited these areas in west Africa. As part of contingency preparations, PHE has provided primary care and hospital healthcare workers with the latest information about the outbreak and actions to take in the event of a possible case.” Advice has also been issued to UK immigration centres, universities and schools, and humanitarian workers travelling to affected countries, and the public.</p> <h2>Are there signs of disquiet in the UK?</h2> <p><br />Despite repeated reassurances from PHE, a school has cancelled the visit of a charity worker and her son because of parents’ fears that their children could be infected with Ebola. The nine-year-old from Sierra Leone was due to study at St Simon’s Catholic primary school in Hazel Grove, Stockport, this month on a placement while his mother was on fundraising duties for the EducAid charity, which runs a network of free schools for vulnerable youngsters in the west African country. But Elizabeth Inman, the headteacher, has written to parents to say that “with a very heavy heart” the school and its governors had taken “the pragmatic decision” to halt the visit, despite the mother and her son having been screened and given unrestricted movement in the UK. “It is with great sadness that we decided to cancel the visit. The misguided hysteria emerging is extremely disappointing, distracting us from our core purpose of educating your children. It is not an environment that I would wish a visitor to experience.”</p>

Cases have also been imported into Nigeria, Senegal and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/texas-ebola-patient-condition-improves-critical" title="">the US</a>.</p> <p>Marvin Barth, Barclays’s European head of foreign exchange research, said if Ebola became endemic in west Africa and more contagious it would be a greater threat to the world economy and markets than the Sars outbreak of 2003.</p> <p>In a note to clients, he said: “That endemicity of Ebola to west Africa, or even a larger outbreak, greatly increases the chances of the disease breaking out to other more economically integrated economies is evident in the fact that cases have already been confirmed in Dallas, Texas, and Madrid, Spain, despite an outbreak of only 7,000 people in three small countries without direct air traffic to either the United States or Spain.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-europe-unavoidable-who-spain <p>The World Health Organisation has said it is ready to provide support for Spain as authorities in the country scrambled to contain the first case of Ebola infection within Europe.</p> <p>WHO’s European director, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said it was “quite unavoidable … that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel from Europe to the affected countries and the other way around”.</p> <p>She added: “The most important thing in our view is that Europe is still at low risk, and that the western part of the European region particularly is the best prepared in the world to respond to viral haemorrhagic fevers including Ebola.”</p> <p>In Britain, David Cameron will chair an emergency Cobra meeting on Wednesday to discuss the outbreak of Ebola in west Africa, though No 10 stressed it had been scheduled for some time.</p> <p>In advance of that meeting, Cameron called the president of Sierra Leone, Ernest Bai Koroma, to find out what extra help might be needed.</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman said the president informed Cameron that the situation “continued to be very serious and they were increasing their response, with a need to train more medical staff, have a better system for servicing treatment centres and improve the burial process”.</p> <p>He added: “The prime minister said the UK would continue to do all it could to support their efforts.”</p> <p>Public Health England (PHE) moved swiftly to reassure the public that an outbreak of the disease was unlikely. “The overall risk of Ebola to the UK remains low,” the agency said in a statement.</p> <p>“The UK contingency plans for Ebola have always been based on the assumption that there is a low, but nevertheless real, risk of importing a case of Ebola from west Africa. However, it is important to remember that even if a case is identified here, the UK has robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases.”</p> <p>WHO recommends exit screening for people with unexplained illness leaving Ebola-affected countries, PHE pointed out. Entry screening at British ports and airports is not recommended by WHO, however. It would have to involve screening every returning traveller, because people could travel via a third country.</p> <p>Dr Paul Cosford, director of health protection at PHE, said: “The risk of travellers and people working in affected countries contracting Ebola remains low, but PHE continues to keep border staff and medical practitioners informed, and request they remain vigilant for unexplained illness in those who have visited these areas in west Africa. As part of contingency preparations, PHE has provided primary care and hospital healthcare workers with the latest information about the outbreak and actions to take in the event of a possible case.</p> <p>“Advice has also been issued to UK immigration centres, universities and schools, and humanitarian workers travelling out to affected countries, and the general public. PHE will continue to liaise with the Border Agency and Port Health, and other partners, to provide ongoing guidance.”</p> <p>Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at PHE, said: “UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases. If an Ebola case is repatriated to, or detected in, the UK they would receive appropriate treatment in an isolation unit, with all appropriate protocols promptly activated. Protective measures would be strictly maintained to minimise risk of transmission to healthcare workers treating the individual.</p> <p>“It is important to remember that for Ebola to be transmitted from one person to another, contact with blood or other body fluids is needed. As such, if England was to see a case of Ebola this will not result in an outbreak here.”</p> <p>In the US, one coastguard sector said it would contact ships that had recently been to Ebola-affected countries to ask whether passengers had symptoms of the virus before they were allowed into port.</p> <p>It issued a bulletin to the maritime community in Long Island Sound, which includes parts of New York and Connecticut, on Monday. The bulletin describes protocols being put into place due to Ebola. It did not immediately say whether the protocols were being used nationwide.</p> <p>The coastguard said the policy applies to vessels that have been to an affected country within its last five ports of call.</p> <p>In Dallas, Texas, Thomas Duncan, the first Ebola patient diagnosed on US soil is in a critical condition. Thomas is on a ventilator and a kidney dialysis machine to help stabilise him, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where he is being treated said Tuesday.</p> <p>The Obama administration is considering whether to begin extra screenings at airports to check passengers coming from Ebola-stricken countries. It has said it would not stop flights from those countries.</p> <p>Ebola has infected about 7,200 people in west Africa, killing more than 3,400 of them in the largest outbreak of the disease in history. Cases have also been imported into Nigeria, Senegal and the US.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/threat-to-dog-spanish-nurse-ebola-sparks-online-petition <p>The husband of the Spanish nurse infected with Ebola has launched an online campaign to save the couple’s dog, after health authorities told him it would have to be put down.</p> <p>In a note distributed on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/axlamadrid" title="">social media by several animal protection organisations</a>, Javier Limón Romero said health officials had asked for his consent to put down the dog Excálibur.</p> <p>“I said no. And they told me that they would ask for a court order to enter my house and put him down,” Romero said in the note.</p> <p>The appeal was sent from Limón Romero’s isolation ward in the Carlos III Hospital where his wife, Teresa Romero Ramos, is also in quarantine. The dog is currently at home alone, he said, but noted that before going to the hospital he set out “several buckets of water, filled the bathtub with water and left out 15kg of feed.</p> <p>“The terrace was also left open so that he could do his business,” he said.</p> <p>Limón Romero dismissed the authorities’ worries that the dog may be carrying the Ebola virus, arguing that Excálibur would not infect anyone. “If it bothers them so much then they should find other alternative solutions, such as putting the dog in quarantine and observation, as they have done with me.” He added: “But of course a dog is easier, it doesn’t matter as much.”</p> <p>His plea spread quickly across the internet, with the hashtag #SalvemosAExcalibur, or Let’s save Excalibur, dominating Twitter. By Tuesday evening, more than 135,000 had people signed an <a href="https://www.change.org/p/a-los-que-sea-m%C3%ADnimamente-sensibles-poner-en-cuarentena-o-aislamiento-al-perro-de-la-auxiliar-infectada-por-%C3%A9bola-en-lugar-de-sacrificarlo?recruiter=162736074&amp;utm_campaign=share_facebook_responsive&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_source=share_petition" title="">online petition backing his plea</a>.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-fears-alcorcon-hospital-spain <p>As she waited for her bus next to an advert urging people to donate money for the fight against Ebola overseas, Elena Felican could only shake her head at how close the threat posed by the virus now felt to her in Spain.</p> <p>“My sister called me first thing this morning, telling me not to go to near the hospital,” said the catering worker. “She told me the patient lived in Alcorcón. How does this happen? It’s really scary.”</p> <p>Few details have emerged about the first person known to have contracted the Ebola virus outside west Africa. The Spanish nurse, who tested positive on Monday, was part of a team that cared for two elderly Spanish missionaries who both died after being evacuated to Madrid for treatment.</p> <p>On Tuesday night her husband said she had followed all the regulations. “She did all that they told her to. At no moment was she worried about being infected,” he told El Mundo. The pair had intended to go on holiday, but changed their plans after he injured his leg, he told the newspaper in a phone interview from the room where he has been isolated.</p> <p>He complained that health authorities had told him his dog would have to be put down because it had been in contact with his wife. “They told me that if I didn’t give them my authorisation, they would get a court order and enter the house by force to kill the dog. Then what will they do next? Sacrifice me too?”</p> <p>In Alcorcón, a city of 170,000 people on the outskirts of Madrid, many wondered just how worried they should be.</p> <p>“She might have been living in this neighbourhood for days with Ebola,” said Felican. “Did she go to the supermarket? The gym? We don’t know anything.” Three primary schools ringed the hospital where the nurse had tested positive, she pointed out, and all of them were open on Tuesday.</p> <p>Her concerns were echoed inside the imposing hospital. Juan Pulido, who sat casually flipping through a newspaper while he waited for his wife to finish her appointment, said his family had urged him not to go. “Every day I sit here, waiting for my wife. I decided today would be no exception,” said the retiree, brushing off their worries. “But it seems like nobody else dared to come – it’s empty today.”</p> <p>The infected nurse was transported to Madrid’s Carlos III hospital late on Monday. She was placed in isolation, as was her husband, who has shown no signs of the virus. Health officials said on Tuesday they were monitoring 50 more people who may have come into contact with the nurse.</p> <p>Authorities placed a second nurse from the same team in isolation after she complained of diarrhoea. Noting that she did not have a fever, the most common initial symptom for Ebola, doctors said her initial test results were negative.</p> <p>A man who had recently travelled from Nigeria to Spain was also in quarantine at the same hospital but tested negative for Ebola in his first test.</p> <p>Health authorities said they had two priorities: compiling a list of all the potential contacts that the woman had before being hospitalised, and determining exactly how she had been infected.</p> <p>The nurse had helped care for Miguel Pajares, 75, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ebola-spanish-missionary-dies-madrid-liberia">who was the first person to be repatriated to European soil for treatment in August</a>, but she is thought to have become infected while looking after Manuel García Viejo, 69, who died in Madrid after being evacuated from Sierra Leone two weeks ago.</p> <p>The nurse would have entered García Viejo’s room twice, said Antonio Alemany, from the regional government of Madrid. The first time to was to change a nappy and the second time was to collect material from his room after he died.</p> <p>After complaining of a fever on 30 September, the nurse was told to check herself into hospital if her temperature exceeded 38.6C. Fernando Simón, of Spain’s health ministry, acknowledged on Tuesday that it might have been better to have admitted her to hospital right away despite her not showing serious symptoms.</p> <p>When she was admitted on Monday, the nurse remained in a bed in the emergency room, separated from other patients only by curtains, while waiting for her test results to come back, hospital staff said.</p> <p>Several associations representing health professionals in Spain painted a picture of a healthcare system <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-crisis-substandard-equipment-nurse-positive-spain">reeling from cutbacks</a>, drastically underfunded to tackle the challenge of Ebola, and led by a health ministry creating policy on the fly.</p> <p>Elena Moral, of the CSI-F, a union that represents healthcare professionals, said the delay in admitting the nurse to hospital hinted at deep flaws in the protocol. “A patient suspected of having Ebola and a history of working with Ebola patients should have been put in the first ambulance they could find.”</p> <p>She dismissed any suggestion of human error, pointing to a lack of training, infrastructure and safety measures. In some cases, training for health professionals dealing with Ebola was limited to a 15- or 20-minute talk, she said.</p> <p>In July a group of nurses in Madrid brought a complaint before a judge in Madrid over the “lack of training and knowledge regarding protocols” when it came to treating potential Ebola cases.</p> <p>Moral also laid blame on the impact of austerity measures on the Spanish healthcare system. “We’ve been protesting for a long time that the dismantling of the Carlos III hospital could provoke extreme situations like this one.”</p> <p>In recent years, she said, the Carlos III hospital was closed, gutted of its emergency rooms and then turned into a hospital specialising in tropical diseases.</p> <p>“The repatriation of the two missionaries turned the hospital into something just short of a field hospital. Authorities activated the protocols without keeping in mind the actual state of the hospital.”</p> <p>Opposition politicians called on the health minister, Ana Mato, to explain the safety lapses, while around 200 health professionals gathered outside a hospital in Madrid calling for her resignation.</p> <p>The European commission said it had written to Mato “to obtain some clarification” as to how the nurse had become infected. “There is obviously a problem somewhere,” said the commission spokesman, Frédéric Vincent.</p> <p>Spanish health authorities said medics treating Ebola patients in Spain followed the protocols laid out by the World Health Organisation, but their claims were widely disputed. While level 4 protective equipment is required to attend to Ebola patients, healthcare workers in Spain who treated the missionaries had only level 2 equipment, said Juan Carlos Mejias, of Satse, a union that represents nurses. “Level 4 is what’s being used in other European countries.”</p> <p>In August, when Satse learned of plans to repatriate a patient with Ebola to Spain for treatment, it asked the health ministry for a written description of the protocols that would be used. “How many nurses would be involved? How would the nurses be monitored afterwards?” said Mejias. He said the union received no response, suggesting “there was a serious improvisation in how the situation was handled”.</p> <p>Inside Alcorcón hospital, two women working at the hospital gift shop said they knew only what had been reported in the media. “Our co-worker left after her shift last night wondering why there were journalists outside the hospital. Nobody told us anything or warned us that we should be careful,” said one. “At least they could have given us hand sanitiser.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-us-troops-direct-contact-potential-sufferers-liberia <p>A handful of highly trained American troops will have direct contact with potential Ebola patients in west Africa, the head of the US Africa command said during a Pentagon briefing on the military’s response to the outbreak. But a few hours later, the general issued a correction, saying that the troops would only work with Ebola samples.<br /></p> <p>The confusion highlighted the sensitivities surrounding the deployment of up to 4,000 troops to the region. The Obama administration has repeatedly insisted they would have no direct contact with Ebola patients.</p> <p>General David Rodriguez, commander of US Africa command, said on Tuesday that a small contingent of soldiers will be involved with testing the blood of people who display symptoms associated with Ebola. They will help run testing labs to distinguish those stricken with Ebola from those suffering from flu or malaria, he said.</p> <p>“[The soldiers] can operate in a nuclear, biological and chemical environment,” Rodriguez said. “They’re specifically trained to do that and that’s their primary skill set.” Three to four specially trained personnel, dressed in full protective gear, will be stationed at as many as seven testing labs, he said.</p> <p>He later issued a statement clarifying that these troops would not have direct contact with patients. “In response to comments I made today about US military personnel potentially coming in direct contact with Ebola infected individuals, specific to lab testing, I want to clarify my remarks. US military personnel working in the labs are not interacting with patients, only samples,” he said.</p> <p>US soldiers will assist the local authorities by providing “command and control” operations, logistical expertise, medical training and engineering support, as part of a broader response by the US government to stop the epidemic.<br /></p> <p>The Defense Department has tapped 3,200 troops to deploy by late October to Liberia, where they will help build and staff 17 100-bed Ebola treatment units across the country. The US mission also includes setting up and operating Ebola testing labs in the region, two of which opened recently in Liberia. The New York Times last week <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/us-effort-in-liberia-barely-gets-on-the-ground.html">detailed significant logistical </a>delays in the US military’s aid effort. </p> <p>The administration says the new facilities have doubled the lab capacity in Liberia and slashed the time it takes to get results from several days to a few hours.</p> <p>Rodriguez estimated the US mission in Liberia, which he said could take a year, will cost roughly $750m over six months. A fact sheet issued by the White House said that the DoD is prepared to spend more than $1bn on the country’s response efforts.<br /></p> <p>Rodriguez stressed that all precautionary measures are being taken to ensure the safety of the deployed troops, as well as to prevent the disease from being brought back to the US with the soldiers.<br /></p> <p>“I am confident we can ensure our service members’ safety and the safety of the American people,” he said, adding that any soldier who is exposed to Ebola will be flown back to the US for treatment.</p> <p>• The headline and text of this article were updated on 9 October 2014 to include Gen Rodriguez’s clarification.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/ebola-crisis-substandard-equipment-nurse-positive-spain <p>Health professionals in Madrid have blamed substandard equipment and a failure to follow protocol for the first case of Ebola to be contracted outside west Africa.</p> <p>Health authorities announced on Monday that a Spanish nurse at Madrid’s Carlos III hospital who treated a patient repatriated from Sierra Leone had twice tested positive for Ebola.</p> <p>Her husband had also been admitted to hospital and was in isolation, and a second nurse from the same team that treated both repatriated Ebola victims was also being tested. In this case, the nurse contacted the authorities on Monday complaining of a fever. She was in isolation in the Carlos III Hospital while authorities waited for the test results, a spokesperson for the Madrid regional government said. </p> <p>A third person, a man recently arrived from Nigeria, was also under quarantine in Madrid but tested negative for Ebola in his first test.</p> <p>Health authorities said they were monitoring more than 50 possible contacts of the nurse.</p> <p>Staff at the hospital where she worked told El País that <a href="http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/10/06/actualidad/1412618449_833358.html">the protective suits they were given</a> did not meet World Health Organisation (WHO) standards, which specify that suits must be impermeable and include breathing apparatus. Staff also pointed to latex gloves secured with adhesive tape as an example of how the suits were not impermeable and noted that they did not have their own breathing equipment.</p> <p>The nurse was part of a team attending to missionary Manuel García Viejo, 69, who died four days after being brought to Carlos III hospital on 20 September. The same team, including the nurse, also treated missionary Miguel Pajares, 75, who was repatriated from Liberia in August and died five days later.</p> <p>Staff at the hospital said waste from the rooms of both patients was carried out in the same elevator used by all personnel and, in the case of the second patient, the hospital was not evacuated.</p> <p>The European commission said on Tuesday it had written to the Spanish health minister “to obtain some clarification” on how the nurse had become infected when all EU member states were supposed to have taken measures to prevent transmission.</p> <p>“There is obviously a problem somewhere,” the commission spokesman Frédéric Vincent said.</p> <p>Spanish health authorities have said that professionals treating Ebola patients in Spain always follow WHO protocols. The nurse would have entered García Viejo’s room just twice, said Antonio Alemany, from the regional government of Madrid, both times wearing protective equipment.</p> <p>“We don’t know yet what failed,” Alemany said. “We are investigating the mechanism of infection.”</p> <p>The regional director of the WHO in Europe said Ebola would “most likely” spread but the continent was well prepared to control it. Zsuzsanna Jakab told Reuters European health workers tasked with caring for the patients, as well as their families and close contacts, were most at risk of becoming infected.</p> <p>“It will happen. But the most important thing in our view is that Europe is still at low risk and that the western part of the European region particularly is the best prepared in the world to respond to viral haemorrhagic fevers including Ebola,” she said.</p> <p>The nurse had alerted the ministry of a slight fever on 30 September and been checked into a hospital in Alcorcón, on the outskirts of Madrid, with a high fever on Monday. She was transferred to Carlos III hospital early on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>El Mundo reported that it was the nurse who asked to be tested for Ebola, having to insist repeatedly on being tested before it was done on Monday.</p> <p>While staff at the Alcorcón hospital were waiting for the test results, the nurse remained in a bed in the emergency room, separated only by curtains from other patients, hospital staff told El Mundo. Their version of events clashes with that of health authorities, who have said the patient was isolated from the first moment.</p> <p>The woman was on holiday at an unknown location when she began showing symptoms. “We are drawing up a list of all the people she may have been in contact with, including with health professionals at the Alcorcón hospital,” said Alemany, estimating that more than 30 people were being monitored for any sign of symptoms.</p> <p>In August, Spain became the first European country in the current, fast-spreading outbreak to evacuate patients for treatment. The decision prompted concern among health professionals, who said Spanish hospitals were not adequately equipped to handle Ebola.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/british-airways-hampering-ebola-aid-effort-west-africa-agencies <p>Aid agencies fighting Ebola in west Africa say they are being hampered by the decision of British Airways to suspend flights to the region.</p> <p>In August, BA announced it was halting flights to and from Sierra Leone and Liberia until December. It has now extended that suspension until the end of March.</p> <p>Médecins Sans Frontières, whose volunteer doctors have been on the frontline of the epidemic from the start, and Save the Children, which will run a new treatment centre in Sierra Leone built by the UK military, said BA’s decision was causing them problems and sending the wrong message to the world and to people in the region.</p> <p>Christopher Stokes, director of MSF in Brussels, said: “Airlines have shut down many flights and the unintended consequence has been to slow and hamper the relief effort, paradoxically increasing the risk of this epidemic spreading across countries in west Africa first, then potentially elsewhere. We have to stop Ebola at source and this means we have to be able to go there.”</p> <p>More than 500 MSF volunteers have gone to the region, where international staff spend four to six weeks, to limit their exposure to the disease.</p> <p>Save the Children has so far deployed 68 people to Sierra Leone and 40 to Liberia – including nurses, pharmacists, finance staff, psychologists, hygiene and sanitation experts, project managers and security managers – as well as equipment. It was vital to get those people, and more in the future, to the affected countries, said Gemma Parkin, of the charity.</p> <p>“BA, in our view, could be a wonderful humanitarian air bridge,” she said. “What is odd is that the British government hasn’t stopped people coming back. It is a bit strange that BA should have taken this arbitrary stance.”</p> <p>It is possible to reach Sierra Leone on other airlines, but it is slower and much less efficient. When Save the Children sent out a new financial officer for the region to manage the increase in its response, he spent 30 hours at Casablanca airport while travelling with Royal Air Maroc. “We don’t have the time to be spending 30 hours in Casablanca airport,” Parkin said.</p> <p>The suspension of flights was sending the wrong messages, Parkin said. “We very much see this as a global problem and it needs a global response. The countries that are affected should not be left to do all this alone.”</p> <p>A BA spokesman said the initial suspension had been “due to the public health situation in both of these countries” and the airline had been reviewing the situation regularly and had decided to continue the suspension through the winter.</p> <p>He said it was not because of commercial considerations. “We have quite a few different things to consider really. We put cabin crew, for example, on the ground in these countries, or we did when we were flying. We have got to be sure that they are going to be safe and well while they are there.</p> <p>“If you were a crew member and you cut yourself badly when you were staying there, would you be able to go to hospital and receive treatment, or is that not an option for you in those countries?”</p> <p>Asked whether the airline could operate with volunteer crews, he said: “I don’t think that is really an option for us, unless someone was to charter an aircraft from us. We wouldn’t be able to make that work.”</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/oct/07/nigeria-ebola-experience-teach-world <p>As the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/first-ebola-case-diagnosed-us">US confirmed the first case of Ebola outside Africa</a>, world leaders and public health specialists are desperately scrambling to control the west African outbreak. One of the few bright spots is the success of Nigeria in controlling the disease, which could have spiralled out of control in Africa’s most populous country.</p> <p>Ebola surfaced in Nigeria in July, but with the final patients under observation given the all-clear, the country is now officially Ebola-free. Nigeria was able to respond relatively quickly, and use its experience in tackling polio to do so. As we have seen in the US, all countries need to be better prepared, with plans in place in case Ebola is imported.</p> <p>Nigeria’s outbreak started when Patrick Sawyer, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/25/first-case-ebola-lagos-nigeria">a Liberian-American, flew into Lagos on 20 July</a>. He was already seriously ill and later died. In total there were 19 confirmed cases and one probable case that stemmed from Sawyer’s. Eight of these cases resulted in death and the last case was officially detected on 31 August. Since then, no further cases have been detected.</p> <p>Nigeria had a head start over other west African countries. As one of the last countries to still be polio-endemic, Nigeria has been waging a war against the disease. A strong polio surveillance system backed by an <a href="http://ehealthafrica.org/projects/emergency-operations-center/">emergency command centre</a>, which was built in 2012 by the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/bill-gates-ebola-shutting-down-healthcare-system-african-countries">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, has ensured agency coordination so that polio outbreaks can be identified quickly and stopped. A cadre of 100 Nigerian doctors trained in epidemiology by international experts, who have helped end polio in countries such as India, makes up the backbone of the rapid disease response team.</p>  <figure class="element element-image element--supporting" data-media-id="gu-fc-ba8a82e7-7ed4-4f8a-a2d7-6ac4871e0ee6"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/7/1412671016474/83c2cdb0-713c-4606-9133-d14fd692a412-460x276.jpeg" alt="MDG : Ebola in Nigeria" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Pilgrims wait to be screened for Ebola before boarding a plane for Saudi Arabia at Murtala Muhammed airport in Lagos.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Sunday Alamba/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With only six cases of polio this year, Nigeria is tantalisingly close to ending polio and moving the world one step closer to global eradication. But as soon as the Ebola outbreak happened, it was imperative that Nigeria utilised the aces it had up its sleeve.</p> <p>Before Sawyer was identified as having Ebola, he had already infected several people while travelling from the plane to the hospital. Having denied being in contact with Ebola, he was treated initially for malaria in a hospital with no infection control. A nurse treating him later died and it was only when malaria treatment failed that Nigeria’s first case of Ebola was identified.</p> <p>Once that diagnosis had been made, Nigeria mimicked its own polio response and an Ebola emergency operation centre in Lagos was set up. From the polio response team, 40 of the Nigerian doctors trained in epidemiology were reassigned. This centralised hub coordinated the <a href="http://www.health.gov.ng/">Nigerian health ministry</a>, the World Health Organisation, Unicef, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Médecins sans Frontières and the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p> <p>The response was flawed, it took two weeks for the first isolation ward to open and health workers were initially reluctant to work in it. However, 1,800 health workers were eventually trained, protective gear was provided, and safe wards with enough beds and access to chlorinated water were set up so that patients could be treated safely. In total, health workers made 18,000 visits to 900 people to check the temperatures of possible contacts. As with polio eradication, this wasn’t easy but it was imperative to stopping the disease in its tracks.</p> <p>Nigeria and the US both made mistakes when Ebola first hit. It is important other countries learn from this and develop emergency plans to respond quickly to stop it spreading. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/oct/06/ebola-universal-health-coverage">Nigeria’s health system is fragile</a> but the country is lucky to have a comparatively high number of specially trained health workers and a polio surveillance system, which helped prevent an exponential spread. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/ebola-sierra-leone-epidemic">Sierra Leone</a>, Guinea and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/01/ebola-outbreak-liberia-interview">Liberia</a> were less fortunate, the disease was allowed to get a head start and prosper in the remotest rural villages that had poor health infrastructure. But there is hope in all three countries.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-29397acc-6759-40fc-9e20-884530736c8c"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/7/1412671035045/37b17c36-b004-40e7-98b1-68a578c5eaf4-460x276.jpeg" alt="MDG : Ebola in Nigeria : Teachers of Tundunwada Secondary School" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Teachers at Tundunwada secondary school in Abuja warn students about Ebola during an assembly.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As world leaders begin to break from their collective apathy, the lessons from Nigeria are clear. There needs to be enough trained health workers, equipment and facilities available to isolate those showing Ebola symptoms in well-equipped treatment centres. Accelerated action in west Africa, specifically educating communities about the disease, symptoms, treatment, contact tracing and how to bury the dead, can end this virus. There are no short cuts, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/05/observer-view-on-ebola-crisis-editorial">urgent international support is critical</a> to building treatment centres and stopping Ebola.</p> <p>Nigeria cannot afford to declare Ebola over. The first outbreak is but others may come. As with polio, until there are no cases of Ebola, no one is safe from the virus.</p> <p><em>• Oyewale Tomori is professor of virology at the </em><a href="http://www.nas.org.ng"><em>Nigerian Academy of Science</em></a></p>

In recent months we’ve had thousands of travellers arriving here from west Africa, and so far only one case of Ebola’s been diagnosed in the United States, and that’s the patient in Dallas.”<br /></p> <p>However, he criticised other countries for not doing enough to stop the spread of the disease in Africa.</p> <p>“We have not seen other countries step up as aggressively as we need them to,” he said, pledging to apply more “pressure” on foreign governments to “make sure that they are doing everything that they can to join us in this effort”.</p> <p>Obama said another area he discussed with his advisers was how to warn US hospitals and clinics what to look out for, something the administration plans to discuss further with state governors and mayors.<br /></p> <p>“We don’t have a lot of margin for error,” said Obama. “The procedures and protocols that are put in place must be followed.”<br /></p> <p>A separate fact sheet issued by the White House describes how existing passenger screening protocols operate, including how customs officials are trained to visually spot “general overt signs of illnesses” and refer suspicious passengers to a secondary screening by public health officials wearing gloves and surgical masks.</p> <p>Homeland security secretary Jeh Johnson has also issued a circular to airlines providing additional guidance on identifying passengers with Ebola.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/06/spanish-ebola-case-rapid-response-allay-western-fears <p>The news that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/06/nurse-spain-tests-positive-ebola" title="">a nurse in a Spanish hospital has been infected with the Ebola virus</a> by a patient she was helping to treat will greatly dismay those trying to reassure people in Europe and the US that they are safe from the disease.</p> <p>This should not happen. In countries with sophisticated healthcare systems, such as Spain and the US, it ought to be almost impossible for a nurse to become infected once the hospital is aware that it has an Ebola patient.</p> <p>In Dallas, ambulance workers were put at risk and are now effectively in quarantine because of ignorance: the hospital did not know that Thomas Duncan might be infected with the virus when they responded to the call to transport a sick man.</p> <p>But in Spain there does not seem to be that excuse. The priest Manuel Garcia Viejo, whom the nurse was helping to treat at Madrid’s Carlos III hospital, had been repatriated from Liberia precisely because he had Ebola.</p> <p>The virus is transmitted from one person to another through bodily fluids and the sicker the patient becomes, the higher the levels of virus in those fluids, which include blood, urine and vomit. The sick are more dangerous to people nursing them than to almost anybody else. But strict infection control procedures work in the challenging circumstances of west Africa most of the time and should not fail in Europe. Any nurse, doctor or anyone else who has contact with a patient must be in a protective suit, complete with gloves and face mask. The patient will be in isolation and strict hygiene and sanitation measures will be in force.</p> <p>Among the urgent questions now facing the Spanish health authorities will be whether the nurse treating the priest might have removed or failed to put on any part of this protective clothing. Experts will hope there is a rapid answer to that, because there is a real danger otherwise that scare stories, without any scientific evidence, will circulate on the internet.</p> <p>Scientists and doctors have repeatedly said that Ebola is not transmitted through water droplets in the air from coughs and sneezes. It does not have a respiratory route for infecting people. It will be important now to ascertain exactly what happened in Madrid so that any such rumours can be quickly scotched.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/oct/06/missing-maps-human-genome-project-unmapped-cities <p>In 2010, an earthquake struck Haiti. Hundreds of thousands were killed. Then things got really bad. Cholera broke out, and Ivan Gayton of Médecins Sans Frontières received a call from a nun, in a remote village in the middle of the Haitian forest. “Please help,” she said. “We’ve been hit with a horrible disease we’ve never seen before.” </p> <p>Gayton sent a few trucks of MSF staff to try to track down the nun in Baradères. They had only the sketchiest maps. Every village they reached, they thought: “This must be it – they’re dropping like flies here.” But it wasn’t. They left behind equipment and staff, and kept driving, leaving huge numbers of sick people behind to die. The road ran out. They took a boat up the coast. Eventually they arrived at a dock, “piled with corpses like firewood”, Gayton says. This was the nun’s village. The MSF staff did what they could. Over the next few days more than 600 deathly ill people arrived. MSF saved most of them; nearly half would likely have died. </p> <p>Across Haiti, only 0.9% of people treated in MSF clinics succumbed to cholera, compared to 40% of untreated cases across the country; the charity spent $100m (£62m) and saved countless lives. Thousands of Haitians died anyway. Gayton describes the choice of locations to establish clinics as “war triage” decisions. “In triage, some people are badly wounded, others nearly dead. We have to treat the people in the middle to maximise the number of lives saved. We can’t help everyone,” he says. “In Haiti, entire communities and areas were left to die. We got a call like the one from the nun once a week. That’s one of the only ones we responded to. I’m convinced we missed a huge number of people.”</p>  <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://vimeo.com/48984270"                                                                                > <iframe width="460" height="259" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/48984270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>A year of edits on OpenStreetmap visualised</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of MSF’s problem was that it was so difficult to know whether sending people to Baradères was the best use of resources. “Haiti was this gigantic emergency intervention, and at MSF we’d committed ourselves to be the ones who respond – but we couldn’t do it all,” he says. “So I became quite keen to know exactly <em>where</em> the greatest needs were: the greatest impact for the greatest number.”</p> <p>Location, location, location – it has been the founding myth of epidemiology since <a href="http://www.udel.edu/johnmack/frec682/cholera/">John Snow took addresses from cholera victims</a>, put them on a map of London, traced the cholera outbreak to Soho and turned off the contaminated pump. And yet a century and a half after Snow’s breakthrough, cholera and other diseases continue to overrun the world. Part of the reason? A lack of basic maps.</p> <p>A surprisingly large number of the world’s cities remain unmapped. Nobody knows exactly how many, but cities of more than a million people in the developing world get by every day without an accurate map. Development staff in those cities trade photocopies of photocopies, scrawl the names of landmarks on post-it notes, use satellite images that lack street names, or just ask locals. <br /></p> <p>In the west, we take for granted that Google has mapped every street in every city – but when MSF asks patients where they’re from, they often have no idea what the answer they receive even means. Bobere: is that a village, street, neighbourhood, ward, district, province? “Much of the time it may as well be random syllables,” Gayton says. “If there was a point source for cholera in Haiti, we wouldn’t have known where it was. We needed a map – to be able to correlate the alerts we hear and our patient origins to something on the ground.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="b126b5ddd0cfd17ec2fb24b56d5e770b488a6f3c"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/1/1412176826171/11309307-5f26-4001-b2fe-0f39b22011c7-460x276.jpeg" alt="Mapping party in Kinshasa" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Stage 1 ... volunteers at a mapping party in Kinshasa, DRC trace satellite images in OpenStreetMap.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Claire Halleux</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wouldn’t just be useful in Haiti, MSF began to realise. After all, why wait until crises happen? If humanitarian agencies had good digital maps now of places that are particularly prone to natural disasters, conflict or epidemic diseases, they’d be ahead of the curve, and could respond properly as soon as a crisis occurs. But how?</p> <p>The ingenious solution is the Missing Maps project, which when it launches next month will be an unprecedented collaboration by MSF, the American and British Red Cross, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and others to create free, digital maps for every single settlement on Earth. It is nothing less than a human genome project for the world’s cities. </p> <p>The method, developed by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, is deceptively simple – and crucially, it allows volunteers to take part remotely. </p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-51887489-69b5-4af7-893d-6ac839e20176"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/2/1412244882766/82ef5dab-9af7-44e8-9a0e-d3971a2a745e-460x276.png" alt="OpenStreetmap Malawi" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Deceptively simple ... buildings in Malawai are digitally traced on OpenStreetMap. <a href="http://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/"><strong>Click here to see the process happen live</strong></a> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first step is to take satellite images – which, it may surprise you to learn, are often made available to the open mapping community from such unexpected sources as US government agencies and Microsoft – and plug them into the free mapping software OpenStreetMap. <br /></p> <p>Volunteers then log in remotely, from anywhere in the world, and use a easy point-and-click tool to literally trace the outlines of buildings, roads, parks and rivers over the satellite image. Remove the image and voila: you have a basic, digital city map.</p> <p>Next, the map, which still lacks street or landmark names, is physically printed out and posted to volunteers who are located in the city. These “ground troops” – anyone from students to Scouts – each take a small section of the map, head out with a pencil and write down the names of streets and buildings. </p> <p>Finally, the completed maps are posted back to Missing Maps HQ in London, where volunteers fill in the names on OpenStreetMap. The result: a city map that is open source and free for ever. <br /></p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="8838f93dbb08bb3dae843a015b5abcac44a8a2ed"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/1/1412176517832/c2b4a828-26b2-47ce-93a2-e86518e5651d-460x276.jpeg" alt="Lubumbashi maps" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Stage two ... volunteers add street and building names to printed maps of Lubumbashi, DRC.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Jorieke Vyncke/Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first big test case was Lubumbashi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo whose 1.5 million residents lacked something as basic as an online street map – <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-11.6648/27.4900">until now</a>. Missing Maps aims to map the rest of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable urban areas within two years. And because the first and last mapping phases can be done by anyone with a laptop, anywhere, the whole thing can be crowdsourced.</p> <p>“Finally, I can give volunteers something to do that isn’t just giving money,” Gayton says. “Many people want to help MSF, hands on, not just donating. They offer to knit socks for the kiddies and so on. But I tell them no, don’t knit socks for the kiddies – the cost of gettting those socks out there and distributing them just isn’t worth the potential benefit. But with Missing Maps, they can actually participate in real, genuine fieldwork. That’s huge.”</p> <p>Crowdsourcing also gives the open-source project an advantage over Google Maps, which is engaged in its own effort to build proprietary maps for cities in Africa and the developing world. By harnessing the aggregated individual acts volunteered by everyday people, Missing Maps can make its scope truly planetary. Google has similarly been asking people to voluntarily flesh out Google Maps, following criticism that the company was ignoring places where there was no advertising money to be made. After all, there’s no Starbucks in a slum. And <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/02/google-maps-gets-africa-wrong">Google Maps is, like the rest of Google’s projects (whatever their current openness and freedom of use), privately owned</a> and subject to fees at any time they might choose to start charging. </p> <p>“The point of the project is that the maps will all be open source,” says Missing Maps coordinator Pete Masters. “It will be illegal for anyone to charge anyone to use them – meaning local people will have total access to them, not just to look at, but to edit and develop.”</p> <p>That idea more than any other has fired the imaginations of the people in unmapped places, says Gayton. “It’s legally impossible for someone to steal it, to close off and own the data. It’s created by genuine volunteer labour, and belongs to everyone. And the question everyone asks me is: ‘Why?’ They couldn’t believe it.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="b8aab0e1807159d56874ec9d55ac279960d74819"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/2/1412245174118/fc7453d3-8c13-4304-90b3-90ade9cb96ae-460x276.jpeg" alt="Lubumbashi" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">On the map ... Lubumbashi, DRC now has a free, open-source digital map thanks to the Missing Maps project</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Phil Moore/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The project has actually already begun: MSF and the Red Cross have already begun recruiting new volunteers to join the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, teaching them how to map settlements where Ebola has broken out. Ultimately the Missing Maps project will need to recruit the biggest team of digital humanitarian volunteers ever conceived.</p> <p>But the implications of a digital map of all human settlements are by no means only about epidemiology. The possible applications for urbanism – transit planning, waste removal, housing strategy – are vast. <br /></p> <p>“Maps make us think of things like finding a restaurant on the web or navigating with a satnav,” says Harry Wood, a member of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team board. “But somebody also used a map for deciding which road the bus route should go down, and deciding where the road should be in the first place. When you think about it, maps are a very basic fundamental knowledge tool, woven into our urban environment, and silently improving our lives in all sorts of ways.”<br /><br />So it’s not just about fighting Ebola and cholera – though that is crucial, Wood says. “When the Ebola epidemic passes, OpenStreetMap will remain as an information resource silently and indirectly helping with urban planning and economic growth in these countries.”</p> <p>Just as the human genome project simply recorded genes, with scientists subsequently using that data to study disease and create new medicines, so too are city maps just the building blocks for urban planning. Whether the goal is to prevent cholera or crime, Missing Maps is a crucial first step. For much of the developing world, our current digital maps may as well say ‘Here there be dragons.’ There’s a long way to go, but someone has at last picked up a sword.</p> <ul> <li>Guardian Cities will host a Missing Maps party on 7 November to map the city of Baraka, DRC. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/06/-sp-missing-maps-baraka-democratic-republic-congo-drc">Get involved!</a></li> </ul>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/06/stop-ebola-hiv-pandemic-next-outbreak <p>Kinshasa must have been an exciting place in the 1920s. This bustling port on the Congo river was growing rapidly, and with the arrival of the railway the population exploded. Kinshasa was the gateway for all the riches of what was then called the Belgian Congo, as rubber, gems, minerals, ivory and exotic woods made their way out of the country. Think of the <a href="https://content.lib.washington.edu/extras/goldrush.html" title="">Klondike</a> mashed up with 19th-century New York.</p> <p>This, according to research <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6205/56" title="">published in Science</a>, was the perfect incubation ground for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/oct/02/hiv-aids-pandemic-kinshasa-africa" title="">HIV to develop into the pandemic that was unleashed in the 1980s</a>. Lots of migrant men looking for work, busy commercial sex workers and unsterilised needles shared between patients at clinics combined to allow a virus that had previously infected just a few hunters deep in the forests of Cameroon and Gabon to spread rapidly. It went on to infect people throughout Africa, apparently unrecognised for decades.</p> <p>What’s striking is not only how far and for how long an infection as devastating as HIV could have spread without being noticed, but also how modern life, with urbanised living and fast easy transport, makes us increasingly vulnerable to epidemics. It probably wasn’t that the virus changed in the 1920s, it was just that it found itself the perfect niche to proliferate, due to changes in social factors. Even if doctors had recognised it then, there would have been precious little they could have done about it at the time.    </p> <p>There are parallels with the current <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/04/ebola-zaire-peter-piot-outbreak" title="">Ebola outbreak</a> in west Africa. This outbreak is the biggest that we have ever seen and the reasons are at least partly social, rather than biological. Not only has the epidemic struck a highly mobile population, which has allowed it to spread to urban areas such as Monrovia, the capital of Liberia with a population of about 1 million, but after years of debilitating civil war and insurgency the local population has shown scepticism towards the support offered by health workers and national authorities.</p> <p>This, coupled with very weak in-country health systems and almost non-existent surveillance, meant that we all woke up very late to the scale of the epidemic. By the time we realised the size of the problem, the remaining health services had been overwhelmed and the epidemic had spiralled out of control. As we battle now to raise the necessary global resources needed to combat the epidemic, experts are starting to think about what we need to put in place now to prevent such a catastrophe arising again. If we don’t do this, we are all vulnerable to another deadly epidemic taking hold in the region and perhaps spreading more widely around the world.</p> <p>What are desperately needed are better tools for preventing future outbreaks. With Ebola, we are essentially relying on the same methods for controlling the epidemic that we had in the 1970s during the first outbreaks. We need better diagnostics, effective medicines and vaccines. While it is difficult to do research in these kinds of crisis settings, it is essential that we do make the effort in order to be better prepared for the next epidemic. Each time an Ebola outbreak occurs, we need to learn from each epidemic and take that forward to confront the next.</p> <p>At last week’s <a href="http://hsr2014.healthsystemsresearch.org/" title="">Global Symposium on Health Systems Research</a> in Cape Town, representatives of development agencies and NGOs discussed plans for “building back better” for the countries of this region of west Africa to ensure that in five years we have functional health systems that have some resilience to absorb unexpected shocks, with reporting systems that allow us to track emerging infections much more rapidly.</p> <p>Better surveillance systems inevitably mean that there will be more false alarms, with potential epidemics that never take off, but that is a small price to pay if we are better prepared to tackle emerging epidemics before they become uncontrollable.</p>

That’s the verdict of the US <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/" title="">Centers for Disease Control and Protection</a>, an organisation respected internationally for its sober analysis. When they predict a million could die, they are not choosing a big number to garner attention, they are saying it because it is possible.</p> <p>So far, the international response to this human tragedy has been inadequate. In the starkest terms, communities are being ripped apart, local health provision is close to collapse, and many of the health workers needed to fight the virus are instead becoming infected and dying themselves.</p> <p>The facts alone are terrifying: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/ebola-infecting-five-every-hour-sierra-leone" title="">five people infected every hour</a>, <a href="http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/2014-10/desperate-demand-ebola-treatment-sierra-leone-5-people-are-infected-every-hour-0" title="">the number of new cases doubling every three weeks</a> and a fatality rate of 70%. As always, though, while the scale of this crisis is vast beyond our comprehension, the true impact is devastatingly personal. The screams of bereaved parents are becoming a fixture on our nightly news.</p> <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/william-pooley" title="">William Pooley</a>, the British health worker who contracted the disease while fighting the outbreak, has spoken of what life is like on the frontline. Anyone who heard him tell the heartbreaking story of the gruesome deaths of a young brother and sister in his care cannot fail to have been moved by his tears.</p> <p>Last week’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/02/ebola-spread-philip-hammond-video" title="">Defeating Ebola conference in London</a> came not a minute too soon. The window to halt Ebola before it runs completely out of control and shatters communities is closing. Yet the reality, as Médecins sans Frontières’ Vickie Hawkins has made clear, is that we know how to defeat Ebola – isolate the disease, treat those affected, and break the chain of transmission – but our problem is a lack of resources, expertise and ability on the ground.</p> <p>So, while we can be genuinely encouraged by the extra support and manpower pledged at the London conference, those promises won’t start to make a difference until they materialise as a reality in west Africa.</p> <p>Three things are urgently needed: frontline assistance in tackling the disease; community mobilisation to inform the public, and counter damaging rumour and misunderstanding; and support to deal with the indirect victims of the outbreak, those in need of medical care not immediately related to Ebola, such as malaria and diarrhoea. In addition, every effort must be made to expedite the production of a vaccine, and neighbouring countries must be helped with preparedness and contingency planning.</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/16/ebola-outbreak-us-to-send-3000-troops-west-africa" title="">UN estimates that responding to this crisis will cost $1bn (£626m)</a> – but only if it is confined to the three states already dealing with the disease. And that is the key.</p> <p>As always, prevention is better than cure. That’s true for those neighbouring states, and it will be true in the future. What matters now is stopping Ebola and ending the crisis, but the lesson for the future is clear: there is no substitute for adequate local health cover.</p> <p>It was the fundamental lack of proper health coverage in some pockets of rural west Africa that allowed this outbreak to grow unchecked for so long. Now it is a global crisis.</p> <p>In the UK, we have <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/how-stop-ebola-and-next-outbreak" title="">one physician for every 360 people. In Sierra Leone, it is one for every 45,000 people; in Liberia, it is one for every 70,000</a>.</p> <p>A <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/ebola-conference-london-hammond-sierra-leone" title="">cross-party parliamentary report</a> last week concluded that the Ebola crisis shows health services must be strengthened. Now, across the world, from the World Bank to Bill Clinton, there is a growing consensus that this outbreak must awaken the world to the need for universal health coverage.</p> <p>In the words of the former US president Bill Clinton: “<a href="https://www.devex.com/news/should-we-use-ebola-to-campaign-for-uhc-84401" title="">If ever there was a case for using more of our government aid money to build efficient, smart and reliable comprehensive health systems in countries that don’t have them, this is it</a>.”</p> <p>There are many reasons <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/dec/12/un-vote-universal-health-coverage" title="">universal health coverage</a> is so important – 3 million people dying every year from easily preventable diseases. A million die on their first and only day. But this epidemic provides a further powerful example of what can flourish beyond the reach of decent healthcare.</p> <p>So, as the world prepares to agree the next set of development goals next year, it is clearer than ever that universal health coverage must be placed at their heart. The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/04/sustainable-development-goals-take-shape-un-working-group" title="">sustainable development goals</a> will set the path for global development until 2030, and basic healthcare for all must be given top billing.</p> <p>The UK should be at the forefront of those making this happen. The country that gave the world the NHS should champion the right of other countries to have the chance to build their own robust health systems.</p> <p>Development is fundamentally about power and the powerless, and there is no greater example of those imbalances of power than an epidemic that would have been caught and tamed had it emerged in any community with adequate basic healthcare.</p> <p>So now we need, first, to defeat this deadly virus and then to work to ensure that it doesn’t return.</p> <p>No one should die for want of the basic healthcare that many in the rest of the world take for granted. Over the next 15 years we can make that ambition a reality – and save and change millions of lives in the future. Through the UN, the richest nations in the world have to sign up to that deal of universal healthcare, before it’s too late.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/05/ebola-cdc-thomas-frieden-confident-large-number-cases <p>Thomas Duncan, the first person to have been diagnosed with Ebola in the US, is fighting for his life in hospital in Dallas.</p> <p>On Sunday, Thomas Frieden, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said Duncan had “taken a turn for the worse” and was “fighting for his life”. On Saturday, Duncan’s condition worsened <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/04/dallas-ebola-patient-could-face-charges-two-aid-workers-recover-europe">from “serious” to “critical”</a>. </p> <p>Frieden also told reporters that he was scheduled to brief President Barack Obama on Monday as health officials attempt to ensure that the virus others do not contract the virus. <br /></p> <p> The authorities in Dallas said on Sunday they had located a homeless man who may have had contact with Duncan.</p> <p>A few hours after officials told a conference call with media the man was missing, a Dallas city spokeswoman, Sana Syed, said he had been located. Officials said the man was not one of 10 people who have definitely had contact with Duncan.<br /></p> <p>The homeless man, who officials said was in a group of 38 people who may have had contact with Duncan, was said to have shown no signs of Ebola when he was tested on Saturday. Officials say the policy is to monitor the condition people who may have come into contact with an Ebola sufferer for 21 days.</p> <p>Duncan, who is from Liberia, which with Guinea and Sierra Leone is one of the principal centres of the outbreak – has been in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas since last Sunday.</p> <p>Frieden said it appeared that Duncan was not receiving any of the experimental medicines for the virus.</p> <p>Doses of the experimental medicine ZMapp were “all gone”, Frieden said, and that the drug, produced by San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical, is “not going to be available anytime soon”. </p> <p>Asked about a second experimental drug, made by Canada’s Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp, he said it “can be quite difficult for patients to take.” </p> <p>Frieden said the doctor and the patient’s family would decide whether to use the drug, but if “they wanted to, they would have access to it.” </p> <p>“As far as we understand, experimental medicine is not being used,” Frieden said. “It’s really up to his treating physicians, himself, his family what treatment to take.” </p> <p>On Friday, the World Health Organisation said Ebola had killed more than 3,400 people out of 7,470 confirmed or suspected cases. The WHO added that of 382 health workers infected, more than half have died from the virus, which can only be spread through direct contact with blood, sweat, vomit, faeces, urine, saliva, semen or other body fluids of an infected person who is showing symptoms.</p> <p>Earlier on Sunday, speaking to CNN, Frieden said he was “confident we won’t see a large number of cases” developing from contact with Duncan, while a Nebraska hospital said it was preparing for the arrival of a US citizen who contracted Ebola in Liberia. The hospital did not name the man; news media reported that he was Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance cameraman <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/nbc-news-cameraman-diagnosed-with-ebola-virus-in-africa">who was working for NBC</a> when he contracted the disease.</p> <p>Frieden said: “As of now the man in Dallas, who is fighting for his life, is the only patient to develop Ebola in the US. We know there are going to be concerns and rumours and we will track them down. We want people to be concerned, but appropriately concerned.”<br /></p> <p>Frieden said “about 10” people had definitely had contact with Duncan, who was initially misdiagnosed, and that “about 40 might have had contact”, including people who subsequently rode in an ambulance which had carried Duncan. He added: “Every one of them will be monitored every day to see if they have fever. If they do, they will be promptly isolated. That’s how you stop it. That is why we are confident we won’t see a large number of cases from this.”</p> <p>Duncan’s family were moved on Saturday to a house at an undisclosed gated community which Jenkins said had been donated by someone from “the faith community”. On Sunday, Frieden said: “We are concerned about a couple of close family members who had very close contact with him when he was sick. But that’s something that we’ll just have to check for 21 days from the last day of their contact with him.”</p> <p>Louise Troh, the woman whom Duncan came to the US to visit, on Saturday told the Associated Press in a telephone interview: “I pray in Jesus’ name that it will be all right.”</p> <p>Duncan was initially sent home from hospital, a decision which has led to debate about <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/ebola-us-doctors-texas-liberia">what doctors knew about his travel history and when</a>, in which the hospital’s own position has shifted. On Friday, Texas Health Presbyterian hospital released a statement which said his travel history had been “documented and available” to the entire medical team that first treated Duncan.</p> <p>Once he had returned and been given a diagnosis of Ebola, and isolated, contaminated sheets and materials at the apartment at which he had been staying <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/ebola-patients-waste-remained-texas-apartment-two-days">were not collected for some days</a>. They were finally removed, in industrial barrels, on Friday.</p> <p>Asked about such mis-steps, Frieden said: “Ebola is scary. We understand people are very concerned. The reason we had some challenges with the medical waste was that it was the first time we had to deal that situation, and just by chance there had been a glitch in the government system to approve a waste removal company to do that.

http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/05/ebola-america-range-big-pharma <p>As the Ebola epidemic continues to rage in west Africa, with more than 3,000 dead and infections doubling every few weeks, the first confirmed case in the US last week stepped up global fears over the rapid spread of the incurable virus.</p><p>But behind the gruesome headlines, the scale of the outbreak has been raising hopes that it could focus minds at the world's biggest pharmaceutical groups, boosting research on other devastating tropical diseases that have been neglected for years by the drugs makers.</p><p>There are already an estimated 12&nbsp;million Americans suffering from life-threatening or debilitating infections such as Chagas disease, dengue fever or West Nile virus. "Ebola helps us realise we are a global planet: the health of one region affects the rest of us," says Julie Jacobson, senior programme officer for infectious diseases at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Mike Turner, head of infection and immunobiology at the Wellcome Trust, says that "almost certainly, Ebola will increase the visibility" of tropical diseases.</p><p>The worst Ebola outbreak in history has infected more than 6,500 people, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the outbreak an international health emergency, warning that the deadly virus could infect up to 20,000 people by November. When last week <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/first-ebola-patient-us-no-zmapp" title="">a man </a> was hospitalised with the disease in Dallas, Texas, it was the first case diagnosed outside Africa.</p><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/28/gsk-to-testing-ebola-vaccine-humans" title="">GlaxoSmithKline has started making 10,000 doses of its experimental Ebola vaccine</a> – the most advanced product around – and could supply it to the WHO for an emergency vaccination programme early next year, assuming clinical trials go well. The vaccine has been rushed into tests on healthy human volunteers in the UK and US.</p><p>Other Ebola vaccines in development, from Johnson &amp; Johnson's Crucell division and NewLink Genetics, are close to entering the laboratory. ZMapp, made by a San Diego-based company, is the most advanced of the experimental treatments and has cured some patients, including the British nurse Will Pooley, but <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/first-ebola-patient-us-no-zmapp" title="">stocks have now run out</a>. ZMapp's development was supported by the US military's main biodefence research facility, amid fears that the virus could be turned into a biological weapon.</p><p>But until now Ebola, which had sporadic, smaller outbreaks in the past, was not a priority: it did not feature on the WHO's list of 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) drawn up in 2012. Together those 17, which include tuberculosis, rabies, leprosy, river blindness, sleeping sickness and parasitic worm infections, affect more than 1.4 billion of the world's poorest people across Africa, Asia and Latin America.</p><p>The publication of the list in 2012 saw the first concerted effort to tackle those diseases, when 13 pharma companies teamed up with the WHO and the Gates foundation in a pledge known as the London declaration to control or eradicate 10 of the diseases by 2020. The End Neglected Tropical Diseases Act introduced in US Congress this year calls for the United States Agency of International Development to expand its focus on tropical diseases and step up coordinated international efforts.</p><p>Research funding for neglected tropical diseases rose 3% to $3.2bn in 2012 after years of decline, according to a survey funded by the Gates foundation. But pharmaceuticals firms contributed just $527m – a fraction of total spending on research and development of $130bn. Most of the money spent on tropical diseases – two-thirds of it – comes from governments.</p><p>A study published in the <em>Lancet</em> last year showed that of the 336 new drugs developed between 2000 and 2011, only four were for neglected diseases (three for malaria and one for diarrhoeal diseases), and of 150,000 trials registered in late 2011, only 1% tackled NTDs.</p><p>Ebola could change all that. Deutsche Bank analyst Mark Clark says: "Ebola could be the issue that sends the whole thing snowballing. You are going to get more industry engagement. The signs were already positive after the London Declaration on NTDs in 2012."</p><p>Jacobson reckons the 2020 goals are "ambitious on all fronts" but "each one is attainable", even though a funding gap of $1.5bn remains. "Unfortunately, it's always a good thing for a disease to make it to an industrialised country," she says. "A lot of tropical diseases have been invisible to the world."</p><p>A progress report from signatories of the London declaration earlier this year highlighted early successes: Colombia became the first country to verify the elimination of river blindness (followed by Ecuador); Nigeria, Niger and Ivory Coast were certified as free of Guinea worm; and Morocco has been declared clear of blinding trachoma.</p><p>Within the industry, GlaxoSmithKline, Britain's biggest drugmaker, and France's Sanofi are investing the most, each putting more than $100m a year into tropical disease research, according to Deutsche Bank. They are followed by Switzerland's Novartis, which plays a key role in the supply of antimalarial drugs in Africa, its Swiss rival Roche and Germany's Bayer. By contrast, most US pharmaceuticals firms regard tropical diseases as a philanthropic venture and restrict themselves to donating off-patent drugs such as anti-worm tablets, Clark says.</p><p>He added: "To the extent that these diseases are starting to appear in the US, this will put the issue much more firmly on [US companies'] radar."</p><p>Chikungunya has recently joined a growing list of mostly hidden diseases that have taken up residence in the US (mainly on the Gulf coast), according to a study in the <em>Lancet</em> published last month. There is no cure for the mosquito-borne virus, which causes fever and severe joint pain. Once it is established, says Turner, it is extremely difficult to eradicate.</p><p>Manhattan is now regularly sprayed from the air with pesticide to counter another mosquito-borne disease, West Nile virus, which is potentially fatal. Chagas, which can cause heart damage and can be cured in its early stages, affects an estimated 300,000 Americans. Two parasitic worm infections found widely in the US affect the brain: cysticercosis, which has emerged as a significant cause of epilepsy, and toxocariasis.</p><p><a href="https://news.vice.com/article/ebola-doesnt-threaten-america-other-tropical-diseases-do" title="">Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, refers to these illnesses</a> as the "diseases of extreme poverty and of conflict or post-conflict settings". Their rapid spread can be partly attributed to lack of sanitation, health infrastructure and clean drinking water.</p><p>"While there won't be an Ebola epidemic in the US, I am very concerned about the neglected tropical diseases now affecting the US Gulf coast," Hotez says. "They're widespread, but because they occur predominantly among Americans who live in extreme poverty, very few people know about them."</p><p>Andrew Hollingsworth, policy manager of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, says: "Unfortunately, the standard economic model for drug development, in which industry takes all of the risk in R&amp;D and gets a return on investment from successful products, does not work for diseases that primarily impact low-income countries and developing healthcare systems."</p><p>As a result, collaborations with academia and government now account for the bulk (86%) of research efforts. Many companies have formed partnerships with the Gates foundation, which has supported infectious disease research worth tens of billions of dollars and recently pledged $50m to fight Ebola, its largest emergency donation so far.</p><p>Turner says two commissions are looking at alternative financial models, one created by Chatham House and a <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2014/WTP056762.htm" title="">commission on antimicrobial resistance</a> which looks at the growing problem of drug-resistant infections and is led by economist Jim O'Neill (and backed by the Department of Health, HM Treasury and the Wellcome Trust). One idea is that governments could underpin the economic cost of drug development by committing early to buy the first 2m doses of a new vaccine, for example.</p><p>But most drugs for tropical diseases are either donated by pharma firms or sold at not-for-profit prices. The Deutsche Bank analysts highlight the resurgence of the industry's engagement through WHO donations, flexible pricing and patent policies, collaborative R&amp;D and investments in healthcare infrastructure.</p><p>"We see this as both 'doing the right thing' and a strategic investment in the customers of tomorrow, given that the tropics are home to over 40% of the world's population," they write. "Economic growth in the decades ahead will inevitably see many of these nations becoming increasingly important commercially to the pharma industry."</p><p></p><h2>New vaccines</h2><p>One is three people globally are at risk of malaria and there are 3,000 malaria cases in the UK every year, all imported. GSK is developing a malaria vaccine that could be ready late next year and is expected to be sold on a not-for-profit basis. Its success rate was only about 30% in infants but better in toddlers, although final clinical results and data on the effect of a booster are still due.</p><p>But other tropical diseases are much less well known. Dengue fever (also known as breakbone fever), which kills an estimated 20,000 people each year, including many children, has become the fastest-growing tropical disease globally. French drugmaker Sanofi has developed a vaccine with a 60% success rate that will be on the market next year after two decades of research. Mexico, Brazil and Colombia could be the first to market the vaccine.</p><p>Unlike treatments for many other tropical diseases it is expected to become a commercial blockbuster, with annual sales of more than €1bn.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/05/observer-view-on-ebola-crisis-editorial <p>The world’s most <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-ebola-crisis-briefing" title="">deadly Ebola outbreak</a>, which has killed more than 3,000 people in west Africa and set belated alarm bells ringing throughout the international community, has its probable origin in a remote village in Guinea, close to the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. On 26 December 2013, a two-year-old boy fell sick with a mysterious illness whose symptoms local people and medical workers had never seen before. Within two days, the boy was dead. As more people in the area succumbed and others began to flee, perplexed staff from the French-founded medical aid charity, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), developed a nightmarish suspicion.</p> <p>“Samples [were sent] to the Institut Pasteur in Paris,” a World Health Organisation (WHO) investigation reported. “The first news was shocking: the causative agent was indeed the Ebola virus.” Who could ever have guessed that such a notorious disease, previously confined to Central Africa and Gabon, would crop up in another distant part of the continent? The news from subsequent virological analyses was even worse: this was Ebola Zaire, the most lethal in the family of<a href="http://who.int/csr/disease/ebola/ebola-6-months/guinea/en/" title=""> five distinct Ebola species</a>.</p> <p>The finding was recorded on the WHO’s website on 23 March. Since then, for a variety of causes, some wholly preventable, some less so, the often imagined but never seriously confronted prospect of a lethal, global pandemic with no readily available cure, spiralling out of control, has drawn ever closer. “Six months into the worst Ebola epidemic in history, the world is losing the battle to contain it,” MSF’s president, Joanne Liu, told the UN last month. “The WHO announcement on 8 August that the epidemic constituted a ‘public health emergency of international concern’ has not led to decisive action. States have essentially joined a global coalition of inaction,” she said.</p> <p>The reasons why this most devastating strain of Ebola suddenly sprang up in west Africa remain uncertain, but the under-resourced, often panicky and chronically unco-ordinated reaction to its arrival there has been only too painfully obvious. Last week’s report that the Aids pandemic originated in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the 1920s is instructive. In that case, researchers say, increased urban population density, disrupted societal norms leading to sexual promiscuity, and railway travel – the by-products of Belgian colonialism – encouraged <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-29442642" title="">the spread of HIV</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, recent, prolonged periods of armed conflict and population upheavals, coupled with the unchecked exploitation of natural resources by international timber and mining companies, have altered regional ecology, rendering it more vulnerable physically as well as politically. Due to loss of habitat, fruit bats, widely believed to be the natural reservoir of the virus, moved closer to human settlements. People hunted and ate infected forest animals such as monkeys, squirrel and antelopes, the WHO report found. “Though no one knew it at the time, the Ebola virus had found a new home in a highly vulnerable population.”</p> <p>Whatever its causes, it is evident now that the rapid and accelerating spread of Ebola – the virus is infecting five additional people every hour in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/ebola-infecting-five-every-hour-sierra-leone" title="">Sierra Leone</a> and a similar number in Liberia – is the avoidable result of a lack of hospital beds, isolation wards and basic facilities. It is the result, also, of too few doctors and nurses, of underprotected health workers who are themselves falling ill in large numbers, of traditional healing and burial practices, of generally underfunded healthcare systems, of corrupt misappropriation of foreign aid earmarked for healthcare and, crucially, of the lack of a vaccine in the face of a mutating virus. Of the 20,000 new cases predicted by the end of November, 70% on current trends will result in death. By the end of January, the Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta warns, there could be 1.4m new cases.</p> <p>West Africa’s particular circumstances apart, the Ebola outbreak has now become a matter of truly international concern, not least because, as last week’s unseemly panic in Texas has shown, the epidemic potentially threatens us all. After a slow start, the Obama administration showed a lead in sending 3,000 troops to Liberia to boost its health defences. But its efforts are proceeding <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/us-effort-in-liberia-barely-gets-on-the-ground.html?rref=world/africa&amp;module=Ribbon&amp;version=context&amp;region=Header&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=Africa&amp;pgtype=Multimedia&amp;gws_rd=ssl&amp;_r=0" title="">at a snail’s pace</a>, reflecting a too familiar lack of preparedness.</p> <p>The UK, despite parliamentary criticism last week, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/ebola-government-response/about" title="">has been at the forefront</a> of international efforts, concentrating £125m in assistance on Sierra Leone, building a new treatment centre outside Freetown and mobilising 400 NHS volunteers. David Cameron’s commitment to maintaining Britain’s overseas aid and development budget has never looked more sensible. France has been supplying direct assistance to Guinea. But in the face of a potential world-wide crisis, where is the rest of the world?</p> <p>The European Commission makes all the right noises, but its financial contribution has been paltry. One of its <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-14-278_en.htm" title="">main concerns </a>appears to be how to airlift EU nationals in the affected countries. <a href="http://www.dw.de/merkel-pledges-aid-to-fight-ebola-in-west-africa/a-17936086" title="">Germany</a>, Europe’s supposed powerhouse, has only belatedly joined the fight. Meanwhile, other big international players are conspicuous by their absence. What of China, with its extensive commercial interests in west Africa? What of Russia, with its noisome pretensions to great power status? What of the other Brics countries, whose aspirations to a global role are so often heard? It is long past time they stepped up to mark and did their bit.</p> <p>The scary truth of the Ebola pandemic is that, starting with the WHO last March, the world’s leading governments and institutions were, for the most part, caught napping. They thought (as did much of the western media) that this outbreak was another grisly but isolated act in Africa’s ongoing human tragedy. They thought it would not affect us. Now it is plain that it will, they badly need to get organised. They must act together, and quickly, not just to beat Ebola now, but in order to better deal with future pandemics when they come, as they surely will.</p> <p>Peter Piot, the German scientist who discovered Ebola and a veteran of many battles against killer viruses, describes in an interview that we publish today how a “perfect storm” of mischance, miscalculation and mutation makes this epidemic unlike any that has gone before. We should all heed his words: “This isn’t just an epidemic anymore. This is a humanitarian catastrophe. We don’t just need care personnel, but also logistics experts, trucks, jeeps and foodstuffs. Such an epidemic can destabilise entire regions. I can only hope that we will be able to get it under control. I really never thought it could get this bad.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/03/us-ebola-outbreak-extraordinarli <p>White House officials on Friday sought to reassure people that an Ebola outbreak in the United States was unlikely, despite missteps in the case of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed with the virus outside Africa. </p> <p>“The United States has the most capable health infrastructure and the most capable doctors in the world, bar none,” Lisa Monaco, President Obama’s senior counter-terrorism adviser, said at a White House briefing.</p> <p>Monaco and other administration officials urged calm as they faced criticism over the handling of the Ebola case in Dallas. But they announced no new procedural guidelines for hospitals or health officials, insisting the ones in place are working.</p> <p>“The United States is prepared to deal with this crisis, both at home and in the region,” she said. “Every Ebola outbreak in the past 40 years has been stopped. We know how to do this and we will do it again.”</p> <p>Duncan, of Liberia, was placed in isolation at the Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas on Tuesday after testing positive for Ebola. Duncan had gone there previously, but officials admitted that because of a “flaw” in the hospital’s electronic health record workflows, Duncan’s travel history was not communicated to the treating physician, resulting in the hospital sending him home with a course of antibiotics.</p> <p>“There were things that did not go the way they should have in Dallas, but there are a lot of things that went right and are going right,” Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious disease, said at the briefing.</p> <p>“The person is now in isolation being properly taken care of, and the fundamental basis of preventing an outbreak – contact tracing – is now going on. That’s the important thing.”</p> <p>Fauci said it was entirely possible that there will be more Ebola cases diagnosed in the US, but stressed that an outbreak is “extraordinarily” unlikely, given the quality of the nation’s health care infrastructure.</p> <p>Local, county and state officials handling the situation in Dallas have come under criticism for the way they have managed Duncan’s case.</p> <p>It took a hazardous materials team until Friday to clean the apartment in which Duncan was staying, because the team lacked the appropriate permit to dispose of the waste.</p> <p>Monaco said the administration was not at this time considering a ban on travel to or from the west African countries affected by the outbreak there. Echoing the sentiments of CDC director Tom Frieden, Monaco said that prohibiting travel would constrict aid to the region and impede the global response efforts there.</p> <p>“The most important and effective thing we can do is control the epidemic at its source,” she said.</p> <p>The disease has killed 3,431 people out of 7,470 confirmed or suspected cases in west Africa, according to the latest numbers from the World Health Organization released on Friday.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/bill-gates-ebola-shutting-down-healthcare-system-african-countries <p>The Sibos banking conference in Boston – a yearly gathering of more than 7,500 people in financial services – recorded its biggest audience ever for its closing interview. The lure? Bill Gates, the co-founder of both Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. </p> <p>Using his capitalist bona fides, Gates spoke at Sibos to pitch one of the foundation’s priorities: encouraging the assembled bankers to work together to create better banking systems for the poor in countries like Kenya and Nigeria, where bank branches are rare, payments are usually less than $5, and $20 cellphones are often the preferred tool of banking. The Gates foundation has pledged $50m to fight Ebola in west Africa, including the hot zones of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. <br />The money will go to research and funding Ebola care efforts that are both private and public.</p> <p>The Guardian asked Gates a few questions about the epidemic. An edited version of our conversation is below.</p> <p><strong>What do you think when you see the focus that’s been put on Ebola, knowing the number of people who die from malaria?</strong></p> <p>Malaria kills over 500,000 per year for Africa, and that’s come down somewhat with the use of bed nets and artemisinin. It’s a huge priority for our foundation. <br /></p> <p>So yeah, it is fair to ask why does Ebola deserve this huge response. And a key answer is that Ebola is shutting down the healthcare system. It’s actually shutting down a lot of activity in terms of food getting to people, kids going to school. But let’s just focus on the health system. <br /></p> <p>More kids are dying of malaria in these three countries now than they were before Ebola came along. In fact, we don’t have very accurate measures coming out of these three countries right now, but almost certainly more people are dying of non-Ebola diseases than are dying of Ebola. <br /></p> <p>So it would be worth stopping the Ebola epidemic if the <em>only</em> benefit was that it put the health system back in place. <br /></p> <p>Now, the health systems we have in these three countries weren’t ideal before the epidemic took place. That’s partly why gathering the information and getting the treatment capacity has been so difficult in these three, because even by African standards these three have very poor healthcare systems. Overall, healthcare systems in Africa have been improving a lot over the last decade, but with the civil war and some challenges in these countries, these weren’t as good. <br /><br />So we need to get to the civil panic that shuts down these healthcare systems. We need to get treatment capacity, people willing to go to treatment centres so that the health system can re-operate again. And you stop Ebola deaths, so the two things go hand in hand. <br /></p> <p>Then we need to both be on a firmer footing on general health in these three countries and our preparedness for either an Ebola or some other type of outbreak.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>What has the foundation chosen to do? </strong></p> <p>Because infectious diseases are a big area for us, we have a number of ways we’re involved. It’s key to point out that the US government is playing the strongest role in many aspects of this thing. It was Tom Frieden of the CDC who went in August and said that even though the US and we had given money, that seeing the urban impact, that we really all needed to step up. <br /></p> <p>And it was the president who said let’s get the Department of Defence involved because they’re the ones who can do logistics and get people in and out and get things built. <br /></p> <p>The tools – like can we have a vaccine that would protect people, the idea of how quickly could we move, which vaccine constructs should we look at it – we and the [National Institutes of Health] are looking at it hard, talking to all the companies, taking in expertise about how you can get things quickly through regulators, thinking about, OK, can we get a vaccine quickly, can we get a therapeutic? ZMapp as a therapeutic worked in the monkey models but there’s a real manufacturing challenge with that. So we’re working a lot on the tools. <br /></p> <p>We also got involved in the Nigeria case because we have a lot of polio activity there. So we gave the money that created the emergency operations centre and we had some of the polio people come down and staff that emergency operations centre. So we give money, we have staff that is getting involved.<br /></p> <p>It’s the scale of the US government response – the DoD, Tom speaking out, the president calling on other countries – that I feel is the key reason, though I can’t predict when, that I feel we’re going to be able to get on top of this. <strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>What are your thoughts on seeing <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/ebola-dallas-hospital-flawed-response-officials-scramble">the Dallas Ebola case</a> and knowing it exists because we have good Ebola care here in the US in a way that they don’t in Africa? </strong></p> <p>Health is very unjust. The chance of a poor child dying is 20 times the chance of a child in the United States or the UK dying. <br /></p> <p>That’s the great inequity that is a top priority of our foundation, to get rid of malaria and a variety of other diseases that would allow there to be health equity and the idea of all lives have equal value – making it look like the world has allocated its resources as though that’s the truth. <br /></p> <p>The likelihood of people getting Ebola in the US is extremely low, because we know how to quarantine people. Even if you get the disease, the kinds of things we can do in terms of maintaining your body, you’re better off to be here than in the three affected countries. <br /></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/ebola-dallas-hospital-flawed-response-officials-scramble <p>Officials in Texas were still struggling to implement an effective strategy to manage the close associates of the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola outside Africa on Friday, as the hospital where he first presented himself admitted a “flawed” initial response.</p> <p>A hazardous materials team arrived on Friday to clean the apartment where four people are under quarantine, a day after a cleaning crew was forced to leave, lacking the appropriate permit to dispose of the waste. </p> <p>Sweat-stained sheets and towels remained in the apartment for four days since the Ebola sufferer, Thomas Eric Duncan of Liberia, was placed in isolation at the Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas.</p> <p>The hospital said that due to a “flaw” in its electronic health record workflows, Duncan’s travel history was not relayed from the nurse to the doctor on his first visit to the hospital a week ago, which is why the medical team allowed Duncan to be sent home with a course of antibiotics. </p> <p>“Protocols were followed by both the physician and the nurses. However, we have identified a flaw in the way the physician and nursing portions of our electronic health records (EHR) interacted in this specific case,” the hospital said in a statement.</p> <p>“As a result, the hospital has changed the workflows to highlight a patient’s travel history, especially as it relates to Ebola-endemic countries in west Africa,” the statement said.<br /></p> <p>After getting progressively more ill, Duncan was taken back to the hospital on Sunday by ambulance, two days after his first visit. His Ebola diagnosis was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday. On Friday, the hospital said his condition remained “serious”.</p> <p>On Thursday, CNN revealed that his apartment had still not been cleaned. Two pickup trucks and a van, belonging to a local commercial hazardous materials clean-up company, arrived at the complex on Thursday evening. But the clean-up operation did not get under way until late Friday morning. </p> <p>Four “close” family members, including a woman, Louise Troh, believed to be Duncan’s girlfriend, as well as Troh’s 13-year-old son and two nephews in their 20s, are under strict quarantine in the apartment. Local police and armed security guards have been stationed at the apartment complex to ensure compliance.<br /></p> <p>Troh told the Associated Press that she is tired of being quarantined and wants authorities to decontaminate her home. “Who wants to be locked up?” she said.</p> <p>Judge Clay Jenkins, the county’s director of emergency management, said early Friday afternoon that the cleaning crew had arrived and the removal process would take about three hours. The family will remain in the home while the waste is removed.</p> <p>“I would like to see them moved,” Jenkins said, adding that there are no plans to relocate the four family members at this time. Jenkins said he visited the apartment on Thursday night to apologize for the delayed clean up. </p> <p>The items taken from the home and from the hospital will be placed in sealed container, that will be dropped off in a location that will be guarded by law enforcement, </p> <p>“The challenges are real,” said Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, on Friday. “I am confident that we will get it sorted out today,” he told ABC’s Good Morning America. </p> <p>Health officials obtained a formal order to force the residents to stay at home, after admitting they had not complied with a voluntary request to do so on Wednesday.</p> <p>In the latest estimate by health officials in Texas, between 12 and 18 people may have come in direct contact with Duncan, including five school-age children. </p> <p>The children, who are not showing symptoms and are therefore not contagious, attended school Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, a day after it was confirmed that Duncan had tested positive for Ebola, one of the five children showed up for class at a middle school. </p> <p>“We’re not sure why the Tasby student showed up for school on Wednesday but, once he was identified, he was asked to go to the nurse’s office so that a parent could be contacted,” the Dallas independent school district spokesman André Riley said in an email.</p> <p>“During the limited time he was on campus, he showed no symptoms yesterday either.”</p> <p>On Friday, Dr David Lakey, the Texas health commissioner, said officials have narrowed the list of potential or possible contacts from 100 to 50, the majority of whom are of very low concern. The group is being monitored for fever or other symptoms. Among them, ten individuals considered “high-risk” are being monitored more carefully, a procedure that includes taking the person’s temperature twice a day.</p> <p>Duncan’s neighbours in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, believe he became infected when he helped a sick pregnant woman, who later died of Ebola, a few weeks ago. It was not clear if Duncan knew of the woman’s Ebola diagnosis before he departed for the US.<br /></p> <p>Authorities in Liberia have said they intend to prosecute Duncan if he recovers and attempts to return. Duncan filled out a form at the airport in Monrovia on 19 September, which asked whether he had cared for an Ebola patient or touched the body of anyone who had died in an area affected by Ebola. He answered no to all the questions.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the parents of an American freelance journalist diagnosed with Ebola in Liberia said on Friday that their son was “scared” but remained in “good spirits”.</p> <p>Ashoka Mukpo, 33, was hired this week as a cameraman for NBC’s chief medical editor and correspondent Dr Nancy Snyderman. He is scheduled to return to the US this weekend for treatment. </p> <p>“Obviously he is scared and worried,” his father, Dr Mitchell Levy, appearing on NBC’s Today show with Ashoka’s wife, Diana Mukpo, said. He added: “But his spirits are better today.”</p> <p>Snyderman said on Twitter that she and her team will return to the US on Sunday. The president of NBC News, Deborah Turness, said they will be placed in isolation for 21 days as a precautionary measure.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/vital-signs/2014/oct/03/ebola-epidemic-bats-deforestation-west-africa-guinea-sierra-leone-liberia <p>The world now knows in great detail how <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/ebola-us-doctors-texas-liberia">Thomas Eric Duncan</a>, a man who just a few weeks ago showed admirable compassion for a sick, pregnant neighbor in Liberia, has become the first person to come down with Ebola in the United States.<br /></p> <p>What is less well known is how the virus came to West Africa to infect Duncan’s neighbor. Knowing and acting on that story is absolutely critical if we hope to contain future outbreaks of Ebola and other scary diseases before they turn into global headlines.<br /></p> <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/ebola-sierra-leone-epidemic">The Ebola epidemic in West Africa</a> may have surprised most of the medical establishment – this is the first such outbreak in the region – but the risk had been steadily rising for at least a decade. The risk had grown so high, in fact, that this outbreak was almost inevitable and very possibly predictable.</p> <p>All that was needed was to see the danger was a bat’s eye view of the region. Once blanketed with forests, West Africa has been skinned alive over the last decade. Guinea’s rainforests have been reduced by 80%, while Liberia has sold logging rights to over half its forests. Within the next few years Sierra Leone is on track to be completely deforested.</p> <p>This matters because those forests were habitat for fruit bats, Ebola’s reservoir host. With their homes cut down around them, the bats are concentrating into the remnants of their once-abundant habitat. At the same time, mining has become big business in the region, employing thousands of workers who regularly travel into bat territory to get to the mines.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="535481560b45ef67ac6f7cf22a2e5789dd9cd77c"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/3/1412357004378/05feb961-fc3e-48ef-a16b-262aa961d582-460x276.jpeg" alt="mine sierra leone africa deforestation" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Industrial kimberlite diamond pit mine in Sierra Leone, West Africa owned by Koidu holdings, one of a number of international mining companies who have come to Sierra Leone in search of diamonds. Mining is among major factors driving deforestation of the region. Photographer: David Levene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The result: virus, bats and people have had more opportunities to meet.<br /></p> <p>Fruit bats carry the Ebola virus, but generally don’t die from it. The virus could easily have migrated from Central to West Africa inside them in much the same way that birds spread West Nile virus across North America: passing it among flocks during seasonal migrations.<br /></p> <p>Although bats have long been on the menu in West Africa, there are other transmission routes for the virus besides bushmeat. It is conceivable the two-year-old boy in Guinea thought to be the first case in this outbreak was infected after eating bat-contaminated fruit. This mode of transmission may also explain how the disease gets into wild gorilla populations.<br /></p> <p>The bottom line is that there is no public health without environmental health. Deforestation didn’t cause <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/first-ebola-case-diagnosed-us-man-flew-liberia">this Ebola epidemic</a>, but did make it much more likely. The region’s legacy of war and poverty, its beleaguered health care systems, and a series of bureaucratic fumbles fanned a small and isolated outbreak into a full-blown epidemic fire, which has already killed more people than all previous 25 known Ebola outbreaks put together.<br /></p> <p>It is shocking to realize that a tiny virus with just a handful of genes can <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/ebola-orphans-west-africa-guinea-liberia-sierra-leone">fracture families, shred communities</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/15/mining-ebola-africa-nigeria-liberia-guinea-riotinto-vale">destroy national economies</a> and destabilize whole regions in just a matter of months. But this is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/first-ebola-case-diagnosed-us-man-flew-liberia">what are witnessing with Ebola.</a><br /></p> <p>Even as global efforts intensify to quash the outbreak in West Africa, let’s not lose sight of what we can learn in this most sobering of teachable moments: we must give environmental science a much larger and more powerful role in public health practices. If West Africa’s forests had been harvested in a more sustainable manner and its wildlife monitored for health, Ebola might not have jumped into the human population. At the very least, efforts to treat the sick and contain the outbreak might have been better targeted earlier in the game.<br /></p> <p>Pathogens such as the Ebola virus are opportunists. To understand their perils and possibilities, first we need to see the connections. There is a clear connection to conservation and wise stewardship of forests to many public health goods, from from storing up atmospheric carbon to soaking up heavy rains – to acting as barriers to disease.<br /></p> <p>What a difference a bat’s eye view might have made to Thomas Eric Duncan, to his neighbor – and to us.</p> <p><strong>Read more: </strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/bill-gates-ebola-shutting-down-healthcare-system-african-countries">Bill Gates: ‘Ebola is shutting down the healthcare system’ in African countries</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/ebola-dallas-hospital-flawed-response-officials-scramble">US Ebola case: hospital admits ‘flawed’ initial response</a><br /></li> <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/ebola-answering-10-basic-questions">Ebola: answering the 10 basic questions you were afraid to ask</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/03/us-ebola-scare-africa-pandemic">‘The US Ebola scare should be a wake-up call to Africa’s Ebola nightmare’</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/-sp-ebola-outbreak-risk-global-pandemic-next">Ebola isn’t the big one.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/ebola-answering-10-basic-questions <p><strong>What is Ebola?</strong><br /></p> <p>Ebola is a serious, often fatal, disease. The virus is transmitted to people from animals and then spreads among humans through direct contact with an infected person. </p> <p>The Ebola virus was <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/history/chronology.html">first discovered</a> in the Democratic Republic of Congo (then known as Zaire) in 1976 and can be found in various African countries. Periodic outbreaks have occurred since Ebola’s discovery, but the current west Africa outbreak that began in Guinea in March 2014 is the largest and deadliest in history.</p> <p><strong>What is direct contact?</strong><br /></p> <p>Direct contact means that blood or body fluids from an infected person or body have touched another person’s eyes, nose or mouth or an open wound or abrasion. People can also become infected from contaminated surfaces and materials, including bedsheets and clothing.</p> <p><strong>What are body fluids?</strong><br /></p> <p>Body fluids include blood, saliva, mucus, vomit, faeces, sweat, tears, breast milk, urine and semen.<br /></p> <p><strong><strong>Can you get Ebola from sneezing?</strong></strong><br /></p> <p>It is possible to spread through coughing or sneezing, but health officials say it’s unlikely. Saliva or mucus from an infected person would have to get into a healthy person’s eyes, nose, mouth or open wound for the disease to spread.</p> <p><strong>What are the symptoms?</strong></p> <p>The most common symptom is a high fever, typically greater than 101.5F (38.6C). Other symptoms can include severe headaches, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and, in serious cases, internal or external bleeding.</p> <p>Symptoms of the virus appear between two and 21 days after exposure, but typically after eight to 10 days.</p> <p> <strong>Can it spread through mosquitoes?</strong></p> <p>There is no evidence to support this. Humans, bats, monkeys and apes have the ability to spread the Ebola virus, but evidence so far indicates that mosquitoes and other insects can’t transmit it. </p> <p><strong>Is it airborne?</strong><br /></p> <p>Not currently.<br /></p> <p><strong>Can it mutate to become airborne?</strong><br /></p> <p>While mutations do occur, experts say it is very unlikely that the virus would mutate to become an airborne disease. </p> <p>The Ebola virus has not previously mutated in this manner, and experts say there is no other virus that has transformed from non-airborne to airborne in human beings.<br /></p> <p>Testifying before Congress in September, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said this is not something the American people should “lose sleep over”.<br /></p> <p><strong>Is there a cure? What about a vaccine?</strong><br /></p> <p>No, but the race is on to find both. An experimental Ebola drug, Zmapp, has been used to treat a handful of patients, including two American missionaries. It’s unclear without proper testing what role, if any, the drug played in the patients’ recovery.<br /></p> <p>A number of experimental drugs, including Zmapp, are being rushed into trials, but even so, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/first-ebola-patient-us-no-zmapp">experts say </a>it could take months, even years, to produce enough of the drugs to make a difference in the current outbreak. </p> <p>Human testing recently began on an Ebola vaccine, but it would only help protect people who haven’t yet contracted the virus, not those already infected.<br /></p> <p>At this time, the difference between life and death in an Ebola-stricken patient can come down to very basic interventions: keeping the person hydrated, maintaining their oxygen and blood pressure, and mitigating the effects of other infections that might further weaken the body’s immune system.<br /></p> <p>Recovered patients – those who test negatively for Ebola – no longer pose a risk to others they contact, with one exception for male patients: the virus lasts in semen for possibly as long as 90 days.<br /></p> <p><strong>Why are people allowed to travel from infected areas to the US?</strong><br /></p> <p>The White House is not entertaining the idea of a travel ban on flights coming from west Africa. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, Tom Frieden, said isolating affected countries would only make the epidemic worse. He said it would constrict the flow of necessary aid to these counties, which would in turn make the outbreak that much more difficult to stop.</p> <p>West African countries have put certain checks in place to try to prevent infected people from carrying the disease outside the affected region. In Liberia, for example, travellers answer a pre-flight questionnaire that asks about their Ebola exposure history. Before departure at many African airports, passengers are <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/ebola-prevention-thermal-scanner-effective-placebo">screened for fever</a>. Many international airports around the world have quarantine areas in case a person becomes ill while travelling.<br /></p> <p>That being said, the approach isn’t foolproof as people don’t begin to show symptoms until days – even weeks – after being exposed. There is also a lot of misinformation circulating through west Africa about the disease, so people may not know if they were exposed, or may fear disclosing exposure because of the stigma attached to the disease.<br /></p> <p><em>Based on information from the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/about.html">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> the <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/">World Health Organisation</a></em><br /></p> <p>• This article was updated on 16 October 2014 to include the fact that the Ebola virus can last in semen for possibly up to 90 days.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 8 October 2014 to correct the spelling of foolproof.<br /></p>

The Texas patient’s case should refocus our commitment to the principle that everyone deserves the opportunity to lead a healthy and productive life. </p> <p>If the strength of America’s public-health system is an ultimate safeguard against Ebola outbreaks here, then the comparative weakness of such systems in West Africa and elsewhere is the ultimate risk factor for outbreaks there.</p> <p>The health care infrastructure of the nations most heavily affected by Ebola today – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – had been weakened by regional conflicts in the 1990s and 2000s, which degraded basic health services and limited their capacity to accommodate Ebola patients, trace their potential contacts, and communicate effectively with stricken areas.</p> <p>The rebuilding of West Africa’s Ebola-ravaged health services will be a tough challenge, but it is of the utmost importance. One feature of this epidemic is its disproportionate impact on health workers, many of whom have succumbed to Ebola themselves. As a result, we could see further reductions in public health capacity in the region in the short term.</p> <p>We’re also likely to see downstream health impacts because so many people have simply given in to the outbreak: Hundreds of parents in Liberia have stopped taking their children to health posts to be immunized against preventable diseases. Pregnant women have stopped going to hospitals to deliver their children. Sick people have stopped seeking treatment for malaria and other infectious diseases at local clinics. And some West African communities have stopped planting crops or trading goods because they fear coming into contact with people carrying the Ebola virus.</p> <p>In this desperate context, public and private partners will need to step forward in the months ahead to help restore the basic functions of primary health care services and provide stressed communities with temporary food aid.</p> <p>The scale of West Africa’s Ebola outbreak demands a global response comparable to those for earthquakes, floods and other humanitarian emergencies. But it also requires that we take steps – right now – to prevent future crises. </p> <p>Indeed, to prepare for any future outbreaks, it’s worth referring back to the Sars crisis that affected more than 8,000 people worldwide a decade ago. That outbreak led to significant global improvements in disease surveillance and in the recognition of the acute need for better cooperation across borders and among national health agencies. </p> <p>But we need a long-range commitment to develop effective, low-cost treatment and prevention for diseases that affect the world’s poorest people. We must also address the market failures that have made this so difficult in the past. The only way to stay ahead of emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola and dengue – as well as the rapidly evolving threats posed by drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis and malaria – is to stay fully invested in a robust R&amp;D pipeline for new drugs, new vaccines, and other life-saving tools. The market for a cure cannot fail.</p> <p>The spread of Ebola reminds us of how emergency-health preparedness can quite literally become a matter of life and death. Right now, we need to help unaffected countries surrounding Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone launch emergency operations centers that can monitor health data and act quickly to identify and isolate cases introduced by international travelers. </p> <p>Nigeria, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/health/ebola-outbreak-in-nigeria-appears-to-be-over.html">in an astounding example of timely emergency response</a>, contained an Ebola outbreak in Africa’s most populous nation in part by reassigning people who had been dedicated to polio-elimination efforts to the suddenly even more urgent task of identifying the contacts of an infected Liberian businessman who had flown from Monrovia to Lagos.</p> <p>Ebola’s appearance in America – by way of an infected man who flew from Monrovia to Brussels to Washington to Dallas – demands a proper perspective. In response to the concerning but containable threat of Ebola in the United States, avoiding excessive alarm is wise; avoiding excessive complacency, wiser still. </p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/-sp-ebola-outbreak-risk-global-pandemic-next <p>The Black Death swept into Europe on boats from the East in the 14th century, killing as much as half the population of the continent, somewhere between 75 and 200 million people worldwide.<br /></p> <p>The Spanish flu of 1918, carried around the world by soldiers bound for or returning from the butchery of Europe’s battlegrounds, killed between 50 and 100 million people – many more than died in the First World War itself, and maybe more than have died in any war.</p> <p>Humanity is locked in a millennia-old battle to the death with diseases like these. We have fought them back with herculean effort. We developed penicillin and other antibiotics to treat bacteria like the ones thought responsible for the Black Death, and vaccines to fight viruses.</p> <p>But we are in an arms race. And while our ability to treat disease is better than ever before, the current outbreak of Ebola, and the first diagnosis of the virus outside of Africa, is reminding us that as our cities get bigger and international travel becomes easier, the risks involved in an outbreak grow ever higher. We are, as Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, says, “in a perfect storm for viral emergence.” </p> <h2>Ebola is very unlikely to become the next Black Death</h2> <p>Though Ebola has a high fatality rate when contracted, it is not the thing that keeps most epidemiologists up at night. It could theoretically become pandemic – that is, an out-of-control global epidemic – but experts say that is unlikely. </p> <p>Christophe Fraser, a professor of epidemiology at the medical research council center for outbreak analysis at Imperial College, London, described four factors that are crucial in determining how severe an epidemic will be: how easily the disease is transmitted; how feasible it is to develop a vaccine and a treatment; how long before symptoms are visible the patient is infectious; and the severity of the disease – what proportion of people who contract it die. </p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="667e9815b409dab6c81c1de349e07a1cb81e3633"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/3/1412294024132/7a278182-0b0e-44af-a0a1-271025aa6777-460x276.jpeg" alt="bubonic plague " width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Praying for relief from the bubonic plague – also known as the Black Death.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Hulton archive /Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Obviously if a virus is worse on all those scales,” he said, “that makes for a worse scenario. Ebola is very high on severity, and very low in terms of mode of transmission.” Ironically, this makes it safer – a disease that killed a smaller percentage of those who contract it but was more easily spread could reach and ultimately kill many more people.</p> <p>Ebola is very unlikely to become the next Black Death. But that doesn’t mean something else won’t. Even with modern medicine, we haven’t rid ourselves of pandemics; indeed, they have sprung up far more recently than 1918. HIV/Aids is the most recent truly devastating pandemic – and H5N1 avian flu was even more widespread, though less deadly.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote"> <blockquote> <p>Ebola is very high on severity, and very low in terms of mode of transmission</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are many nightmare scenarios, according to Robert G Webster, chair of the virology division at St Jude children’s research hospital. “Just imagine if the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was transmitted by aerosol. If flu was just as lethal. If H5N1 [avian flu] was as lethal in humans as it is in chickens – and studies have shown that it only takes about three mutations to make it highly lethal. It’s not out of the realms of possibility.”</p> <p>Fraser said that pandemics are extremely difficult to predict because they all start from a random event: a pathogen crossing to humans from another species. “The initial change, the transition, that’s where the pathogen sets in motion its change of transmission,” he said. “There are outbreaks of all kinds of strange viruses that come from contact between animals and humans; one in a million will give rise to a starting pandemic.”</p> <p>That moment, he said, when the virus is learning to propagate in a new kind of host, is when much of its genetic mutation happens – after that, its evolution is much slower. The real danger is a brand new virus, or a hybrid of several (HIV is a combination of four viruses), rather than an evolution of one which, like Ebola, is already known to humans. </p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="18c3192487cada6f994283c0677173bce7bb3fb2"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/3/1412293766959/2f508e1e-2fcf-44de-a7a2-bcd997f7ea08-460x276.jpeg" alt="Flu shot" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">‘There have been three major [influenza] pandemics, and a mild one three years ago – which doesn’t reduce the possibility of a pandemic happening,’ Ran Balicer said.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Darron Cummings/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ran Balicer, director of the infectious diseases track in the public health department of Ben Gurion University in Israel, thinks that the most likely candidate for another pandemic is a strain of influenza. “It is always on the horizon, and is a devastating scenario,” he said. “It has a good possibility of manifesting in our lifetime; there have been three major pandemics, and a mild one three years ago – which doesn’t reduce the possibility of a pandemic happening.”</p> <h2>Primary responders</h2> <p>“Flu mutates all the time, that’s the trouble,” said Webster, whose research specialty is influenza. He said he thinks the US is better-prepared for a global pandemic than it used to be. </p> <p>But there are no guarantees.</p> <p>The US has many advantages in combating the spread of diseases. Near-universal literacy, television and internet penetration mean reliable information about how to deal with an outbreak is much more easily disseminated to those who need it. The lack of these has greatly hindered efforts to fight Ebola in West Africa, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/-sp-ebola-out-of-control-west-africa">where local customs and superstitions</a> – including traditions surrounding the treatment of dead bodies – have made it easier for the virus to spread.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote"> <blockquote> <p>In West Africa, no one was prepared for Ebola</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Additionally, US pharmaceutical companies are contracted to create a constantly updated bank of seed-stock for vaccines every time a new strain of a virus like influenza is discovered, which allows lots of doses of vaccine to be made in a short time if an outbreak occurs.</p> <p>According to Ben Knowles, a spokesperson for the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as long as an outbreak remains outside the United States, the organisation in charge is the World Health Organisation. When a new outbreak occurs in the US – <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/02/dallas-ebola-us-patient-family-members">such as the patient in Texas infected with Ebola</a> – the first point of control is the individual state governments. “They are the primary responders,” Knowles said.</p> <p>When a disease on US soil spreads to multiple states, as happened with H5N1 avian flu, then the federal government takes over using the Incident Command Structure, a complex mechanism of interlocking agencies including Fema, the CDC, the Department of Homeland Security and others – the same mechanism that is triggered in the event of a natural disaster or terrorist attack. </p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-afe21d4a-c52a-4040-ad53-d553b62620e3"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/3/1412293870765/d9f2a7d9-9a38-4735-b3b1-95479a3e7179-460x276.jpeg" alt="People wear masks on the streets of Hong Kong following the outbreak of Sars, March 2003." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">People wear masks on the streets of Hong Kong following the outbreak of Sars, in March 2003.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That mechanism has not been activated by the Ebola diagnosis given to Thomas Eric Duncan, the patient in Dallas. The CDC is in the area, rather, because it was invited by the state authorities in Texas to send a team to help.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote"> <blockquote> <p>The only question is: will we experience a mild disease, or a devastating disease like in 1918</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there are issues with American preparedness. A 2014 report by the Department of Homeland Security with the ominous title “DHS Has Not Effectively Managed Pandemic Personal Protective Equipment and Antiviral Medical Countermeasures” found that the DHS “did not adequately conduct a needs assessment prior to purchasing pandemic preparedness supplies and then did not effectively manage its stockpile of pandemic personal protective equipment and antiviral medical countermeasures.”</p> <p>Its authors discovered that, among other things, 84% of the department’s store of hand sanitiser was expired – some as much as four years out of date – and that 81% of the department’s antiviral medication would expire by the end of 2015. To solve this problem, the department is “applying for a shelf-life extension with the Food and Drug Administration” for the influenza drug Tamiflu.</p> <p>Fraser said that the current outbreak of Ebola has shown that the global systems that are supposed to spot outbreaks of diseases are not good enough, “and more importantly, the action that follows is not fast enough, not coordinated enough, to cut off an epidemic at source. We know it’s possible – one of the triumphs of the last few decades was the containment of Sars,” he said. “But we failed to achieve that in the case of Ebola.”</p> <p>Webster agreed. “In West Africa, no one was prepared for Ebola,” he said. “We are better off for flu; we can be prepared more quickly. But still if something like Ebola was to spread rapidly, there wouldn’t be the resources in the world. You have to have the equivalent of a police force to deal with it.”</p> <p>“Once every few years we see a new disease in humans,” said Balicer. “Over and over again, we see examples of new diseases; Sars, Aids, mad cow disease. You see, in a pretty constant manner, new pathogens emerging, and we can expect this trend to continue.”</p> <p>“It’s an example of rolling the dice,” he added. “The only question is: will we experience a mild disease, or a devastating disease like in 1918?”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/ebola-sierra-leone-president-appeal-australian-help <p>The president of Sierra Leone has sent a personal plea to Australia to send medical and engineering assistance to help the country deal with the outbreak of Ebola in the country.<br /></p> <p>Ernest Bai Koroma wrote a letter to Tony Abbott, dated 18 September, which asks for specific help to deal with the “outbreak of this dreadful disease”, which has caused more than 3,300 deaths in west Africa.</p> <p>Koroma’s letter reportedly admits that Sierra Leone’s health system is “overwhelmed” by the disease, with the president requesting “military health units, logisticians and engineers” to help isolate and treat infected people.</p> <p>Noting the Australian humanitarian response to typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, Koroma states: “If the Australian military is able to help build and operate even three 100-bed isolation facilities in Sierra Leone, your government will save potentially thousands of lives by removing patients from communities where they are infecting their relatives and neighbours.”</p> <p>On Thursday, Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, announced a further $10m in aid to fight the Ebola outbreak, bringing Australia’s total assistance to $18m.</p> <p>However, the government has so far declined to send health workers to west Africa, citing the risk of them contracting the disease. This stance has been criticised by aid organisations Save the Children and Médicins Sans Frontières.</p> <p>On Friday, the ABC reported that a Tasmanian man who had lost eight relatives to the Ebola virus was organising a shipment of medical equipment to Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Isaiah Lahai, who moved to Tasmania in 2006 after spending 14 years in African refugee camps, has assembled a batch of medical protective gear to be sent from Sydney to Sierra Leone.</p> <p>“There is a very serious need for food, there is need for infrastructure and development and a whole lot of other things, so at the moment we are open to any support we can get,” he said. “Australia should send doctors that are qualified, doctors that are actually able to put the Ebola outbreak under control.</p> <p>“If we do not do something now Ebola outbreak is going to be a global epidemic.”</p> <p>Responding to the suggestion by the Australian Medical Association that Australia could do more, Bishop said the government’s first responsibility was to ensure the disease did not spread to Australia.</p> <p>“If [Australian health workers] are working in West Africa we need an evacuation plan in place,” she told the ABC. “We do not have a credible evacuation plan that would be able to get Australian health workers back to Australia. That is the expert advice of our military and our health department.</p> <p>“The AMA agrees that we don’t have the aeroplane and we don’t have the capacity to get people back to Australia.</p> <p>“We have been discussing with other countries located geographically much closer to west Africa as to whether or not Australian health workers could be evacuated to their countries. At this time we have no guarantees from any other country.”</p> <p>So far, the US has deployed 3,000 troops to help deal with the Ebola outbreak, while Britain is spending $185m on targeted aid. The UN has said a further $54m is required over the next four weeks to help deliver treatment. </p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/ebola-flights-london-sierra-leone-humanitarian-corridor <p>A humanitarian corridor between London and Sierra Leone is to open in two weeks to help tackle the Ebola epidemic after an African airline decided to resume flights to the country.</p> <p>Gambia Bird will fly twice a week from Gatwick from 17 October, raising much-needed capacity for aid workers, business travellers and health supplies to a country where the disease is now out of control.</p> <p>It will be the first direct commercial route opened since August, when <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/22/ebola-airlines-cancel-flights-guinea-liberia-sierra-leone" title="">both Gambia Bird and British Airways suspended flights</a> because of the perceived risk of contagion.</p> <p>Only two airlines currently fly to Freetown - the Lufthansa owned Brussels Airlines and Royal Air Maroc.</p> <p>Professor Peter Piot, the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, one of the discoverers of the Ebola virus, welcomed the move.</p> <p>“The news that these flights are being resumed to Freetown is very welcome,” he said. “The social and economic impacts of this Ebola outbreak are devastating, and cutting off the affected countries from the rest of the world makes the situation even worse.</p> <p>“We need flights to continue to facilitate humanitarian efforts and support the economy. Stopping them will not stop the spread of the virus.”</p> <p>World leaders and experts on disease control gathered in London on Thursday to discuss the outbreak, as reports emerged suggesting that Ebola <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/ebola-infecting-five-every-hour-sierra-leone" title="">was spreading at the rate of five new cases an hour in Sierra Leone</a>.</p> <p>NGOs raised concerns about the lack of flights to affected areas in August, claiming it would further isolate communities and make it difficult to get staff and supplies into the country.</p> <p>“This is a big step forward. It is highly significant. It will increase the options, reduce the costs in time and in terms of getting resources out there,” said Tom Dannatt, the founder of the British charity Street Child.</p> <p>“At the moment, DfID [the Department for International Development] are encouraging NGOs to set up triage centres, but the question is how do you get the equipment out there. So good on Gambia Bird for showing a bit of African solidarity and shame on British Airways.”</p> <p>He said the decision would sent an important message to international communities about the perceived danger of flying to Freetown.</p> <p>Gambia Bird’s main agent in the UK, Kevin McPhillips Travel, said the airline had “listened carefully to advice from leading international organisations, such as the UN and World Health Organisation, as well as IATA, the airline industry body, who have all stated it is important to maintain such air links.</p> <p>“At the same time, they are ensuring they follow rigorous procedures before, during and after flights to ensure the health and safety of passengers and crew, which is of course paramount.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/02/dallas-ebola-us-patient-family-members <p>Health officials in Texas have ordered four “close” family members connected to the Dallas Ebola patient to remain home to prevent the possibility of the disease spreading, and raised the number of people who may have had contact with him to 100.</p> <p>The four family members had been previously told not to leave their home, but an order was issued on Wednesday night to ensure compliance. The measure is precautionary, as they are not showing symptoms at this time.</p> <p>“We have tried-and-true protocols to protect the public and stop the spread of this disease,” Dr David Lakey, the Texas health commissioner, <a href="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/news/releases/20141001.aspx">said in a statement</a> on Thursday. “This order gives us the ability to monitor the situation in the most meticulous way.”</p> <p>On Wednesday, health officials estimated the number of people who came into contact with the patient, identified as Thomas Eric Duncan of Liberia, as being between 12 and 18, including five school-age children. State health officials said they were working from a list of 100 potential or possible contacts, and among them only a “handful” of people who had “direct contact” with the patient are being monitored, a procedure that includes taking the person’s temperature twice a day.</p> <p>“Out of an abundance of caution, we’re starting with this very wide net, including people who have had even brief encounters with the patient or the patient’s home,” said Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman with the Texas department of state health services.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/TexasDSHS/statuses/517675960842596352">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Out of an abundance of caution, we&#39;re starting with this very wide net, including people who have had even brief encounters with the patient</p>&mdash; DSHS Press Office (@TexasDSHS) <a href="https://twitter.com/TexasDSHS/status/517675960842596352">October 2, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Duncan was exposed to the disease days before he traveled to the US in late September. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/africa/ebola-victim-texas-thomas-eric-duncan.html?_r=0">New York Times</a> reported that while in Liberia, Duncan helped his landlords transport their pregnant daughter, who showed symptoms of the disease, to hospital.</p> <p>But there was not enough space at the Monrovia hospital’s Ebola treatment ward to care for the young woman, seven months pregnant and convulsing, and she was turned away. Duncan helped the young woman’s parents bring her home, and she died hours later. The bodies of Ebola victims remain highly infectious even after death.</p> <p>CNN interviewed a woman, believed to be Duncan’s girlfriend, at the Dallas home where he was staying, who said she had taken him to Texas Health Presbyterian hospital when he first became ill. While there, Duncan told a nurse he had recently travelled from Liberia, but the information was not fully shared with medical colleagues who were assessing him, and he was sent home with a course of antibiotics.</p> <p>CNN anchor Anderson Cooper said the woman reported being at work when Duncan’s condition worsened. When her daughter went to their apartment to bring Duncan tea, she found him convulsing and vomiting, and called an ambulance. </p> <p>The woman said the sweaty sheets on which he slept were still on their bed. She had put towels he’d used into plastic bags, CNN reported. Despite having been visited by officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC), she did not know what she was supposed to do with the material. </p> <p>Cooper said the pair appeared to have shared the same bed when Duncan was ill. “It’s not clear to me what kind of contact they had,” Cooper said, adding that the woman did not believe she had come into contact with any of Duncan’s bodily fluids.</p> <p>The woman is one of the four people under the strict order not to leave their apartment and not receive visitors. Cooper said the woman is worried about other people’s perception of her and her family after this incident.</p> <p>Dallas mayor Mike Rawlings told CNN that there are state and county officials as well as the CDC monitoring the apartment and its tenants under quarantine. Lakey said a law enforcement official was stationed outside.<br /></p> <p>“We have locked this apartment down,” Rawlings said. </p> <p>The mayor said that two-thirds of the people on their list of possible contacts may have interacted with Duncan at the hospital. The rest are those that he may have come into contact with at the apartment or elsewhere in Dallas.<br /></p> <p>He said Duncan is in the same condition as he was on Wednesday, which is “serious but stable”.</p> <p> A letter sent by the principal of Tasby middle school in Dallas on Wednesday informed parents that one of the five children who “may have made contact” with Duncan was a student at the school. Similar letters were sent to parents at three other schools.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/TexasDSHS/statuses/517675376550899712">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Ebola: We are working from a list of about 100 possible contacts and will soon have an official contact tracing number that will be lower.</p>&mdash; DSHS Press Office (@TexasDSHS) <a href="https://twitter.com/TexasDSHS/status/517675376550899712">October 2, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The letter sought to calm parents. “Individuals are not contagious until symptoms appear,” it read. “Because of this, there is no imminent danger to your child.”</p> <p>While there was a steady flow of students in red T-shirts arriving at Tasby on Thursday morning, some parents were of two minds about allowing their children to carry on as normal, and had not been reassured by the letters.</p> <p>Several parents dropping off their children said that they were worried and considering pulling students out of classes. Some already have.</p> <p>Brittany Morris was taking her six-year-old son, DaMarrius, to Jack Lowe Sr elementary school, which is not one of the affected schools but shares a campus with Tasby. She said that even as she approached the gates, she was debating with the boy’s father whether to let the first-grader enter.</p> <p>“We’re questioning right now as we’re walking to school whether we should let him go,” Morris said. “They should have closed the school. How do we know they’re telling the truth about who they came into contact with?”</p> <p>Without knowing details about Duncan’s movements while he was contagious but not isolated, Morris said she was fearful about walking freely around the neighbourhood and interacting with others. “We could have passed right by the guy. What grocery store did he go to? Things like that, I wonder,” she said.</p> <p>Some parents reportedly turned up early on Wednesday afternoon to collect their children within minutes of learning about Duncan’s possible contact with pupils. Cecilia Jial, arriving on Thursday with her two children, said she considered keeping them at home, but noted that other children were still attending school.</p> <p>“I’m a little bit scared. I’m not confident. I’m worried,” she said.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="47bc23ae869711f463b4923e203d5421e9cc950d"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/2/1412264269934/92d78ae7-b8c3-47ba-9ce4-b317a4296d60-460x276.jpeg" alt="Students leave Tasby middle school, where a fellow classmate who was in contact with a man diagnosed with the Ebola virus had been removed from school." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Students leave Tasby middle school, where a fellow classmate who was in contact with a man diagnosed with the Ebola virus had been removed from school.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Mike Stone/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The affected schools will receive additional custodial and health workers, as well as extra staff from the district’s translations and psychology departments, among others.</p> <p>Myo Aye, a father, said he would try to speak with Tasby’s principal and teachers. “I have two children, I’m very worried,” he said. “Yesterday some parents pulled students out of school.”</p> <p>A spokesman for the Dallas independent school district said it would not know how many children stayed home on Thursday until later in the morning.</p> <p>Ebola has so far killed more than 3,000 people in west Africa since the outbreak began in March, according to the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>Duncan flew from Monrovia to Dallas on 19 September, stopping over in Brussels and Washington DC before arriving in Texas on 20 September. He was checked for fever before boarding the plane, and did not show any symptoms of having the disease. </p> <p>As Ebola is not transmittable until symptoms appear, health officials believe the passengers aboard Duncan’s flights from Liberia to Texas are not at risk.</p> <p>Duncan did not begin to show symptoms until 24 September. Two days later he went to Texas Health Presbyterian hospital. Duncan told a nurse he had traveled from Liberia but the information was not relayed to other medical staff, who diagnosed him as suffering from a “low-grade common viral disease”, prescribed him antibiotics and let him leave.</p> <p>Officials said Duncan had a fever and abdominal pain during his first ER visit, not the riskier symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea. Duncan was taken back to the same hospital by ambulance two days later. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/ebola-us-doctors-texas-liberia">Witnesses said</a> he was vomiting as he was taken into the ambulance.</p> <p>David Wright, the regional director of the US Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, would not say if the hospital was under investigation.</p> <p>Wright told the Associated Press that federal investigators, if they were conducting an inquiry, would examine if a hospital complied with a “reasonable physician standard” in deciding whether to admit a patient with a potential medical emergency.</p> <p>Texas Health Presbyterian hospital is reviewing how the situation would have been handled if all staff had been aware of Duncan’s circumstances.</p> <p>CDC director Tom Frieden said in a conference call with reporters on Thursday that this is a “teachable moment” for US hospitals. The CDC has updated its protocol for hospitals, insisting that a patient’s travel history be taken extremely seriously. </p> <p>“The bottom line is that we remain confident that we can contain any spread of Ebola within the United States,” Frieden said. “There could be additional cases who are already exposed. If that occurs systems are in place so that they will not further spread Ebola.” </p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/ebola-infecting-five-every-hour-sierra-leone <p>Ebola is spreading at the rate of five new cases an hour in Sierra Leone, according to figures released as world leaders and experts on disease control gathered in London to discuss the outbreak.</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/2014-10/desperate-demand-ebola-treatment-sierra-leone-5-people-are-infected-every-hour-0">figures from Save the Children</a> showed there were 765 new cases last week in the west African country alone, but only 327 hospital beds to treat infected patients. The charity said the “terrifying” rate of the spread of the disease was outstripping medical supplies and threatened a breakdown of Sierra Leone’s already fragile health system.</p> <p>The rate of spread of the deadly virus is projected to double to 10 people an hour in the country before the end of October, Save the Children said.</p> <p>The UN said the spread of the disease in neighbouring Liberia was just as alarming and called for a massive international response to prevent the outbreak wreaking havoc in west Africa and beyond. <a href="https://audioboom.com/boos/2528570-un-calls-for-massive-international-response-ebola-outbreak-to-prevent-disease-wreaking-havoc-in-west-africa-and-beyond">Speaking from Liberia, Anthony Banbury</a>, the head of a new UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, said: “It is fairly similar in Liberia. The disease is spreading very rapidly – cases doubling every 20 days.”</p> <p>Interviewed on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qj9z">BBC Radio 4’s Today programme</a>, Banbury said: “The disease has reached every county of Liberia. It is clear that the international community has to have a rapid and very strong response to get this disease under control before it wreaks much more massive havoc in these countries and possibly other ones.”</p> <p>The first patient to be diagnosed with Ebola outside of Africa <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/ebola-case-diagnosed-us-officials-texas-virus">told medical staff in the US that he had recently travelled to Liberia</a>.</p> <p>Banbury added: “We now need a very massive international response, that combines health interventions, big logistics as well as mass community mobilisation – getting information out to very remote villages, explaining to them how to protect themselves against the disease and what to do if someone falls sick.”</p>  <figure class="element element-audio" data-canonical-url="https://audioboom.com/boos/2528570-un-calls-for-massive-international-response-ebola-outbreak-to-prevent-disease-wreaking-havoc-in-west-africa-and-beyond"> <iframe width="460" height="154" src="http://audioboom.com/boos/2528570-un-calls-for-massive-international-response-ebola-outbreak-to-prevent-disease-wreaking-havoc-in-west-africa-and-beyond/embed/v3?eid=AQAAAJsELVQ6lSYA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Save the Children’s chief executive, Justin Forsyth, said: “The scale of the Ebola epidemic is devastating and growing every day, with five people infected every hour in Sierra Leone last week. We need a coordinated international response that ensures treatment centres are built and staffed immediately.</p> <p>“This is not only an immediate humanitarian threat, but risks completely undoing the hard work which has been done to build up fragile health systems in Sierra Leone and Liberia after the devastating wars of the past few decades. ”</p> <p>Britain hosted a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/ebola-conference-london-hammond-sierra-leone">conference to discuss the international response to the outbreak</a> on Thursday morning.</p> <p>The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, and development secretary, Justine Greening, were joined by representatives of five African countries and ten other nations including the USA and Cuba, which is sending 300 doctors and nurses, at Lancaster House. UN organisations, charities, the British actor Idris Elba and William Pooley, the British nurse who recently recovered from Ebola, were also present.</p> <p>Hammond said during a break that Ebola was “a terrible scourge”. The conference “was designed to galvanise the international community into greater action to tackle the disease in Sierra Leone... The UK is leading and co-ordinating responses but we need international help. Today we have made significant progress towards securing it.” Sustainable action was needed for at least the next three or four months, he said.</p>  <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/02/ebola-spread-philip-hammond-video"                        data-show-ads="true"                data-video-id="2168565"                data-video-name="Ebola spread is alarming, says foreign secretary Philip Hammond – video"                data-video-provider="ITN"                data-video-poster="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/2/1412245377784/Philip-Hammond--010.jpg"> <video data-media-id="gu-video-448712153" class="gu-video" controls="controls" poster="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/2/1412245374728/Philip-Hammond--008.jpg"> <source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/10/02/141002hammond-16x9.mp4"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/10/02/141002hammond.webm"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/10/02/141002hammond_3gpLg16x9.3gp"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/10/02/141002hammond_3gpSml16x9.3gp"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/10/02/141002hammond/141002hammond.m3u8"></source> </video> <figcaption>Ebola spread is alarming, says foreign secretary Philip Hammond </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He paid tribute to the courage and sacrifice of Pooley, who told the conference of his experiences treating those with the disease in Sierra Leone. Pooley was in the US earlier in the week giving his blood, which now contains antibodies against Ebola, to help vaccine researchers in their work, said Hammond, and is now helping to train health workers heading to west Africa. He is “acting as an ambassador for the crusade against Ebola”.</p> <p>Greening rejected criticism from MPs on the international development committee who said in a report that cuts in bilateral aid to the region had undermined health services and contributed to the spread of Ebola. The UK gave £51m in 2010 and £68m in 2012, she said, as well as contributing to the Global Fund and GAVI, which channel money into drugs and vaccines. The committee said the crisis “demonstrates the dangers of ignoring the least developed countries in the world”.</p> <p>The UK has now invested £125m in the fight against Ebola, including the promise of 700 additional beds, in hospital units being constructed under the supervision of the military, and 400 NHS staff have so far volunteered to go out to help staff them and train local people.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/ebola-prevention-thermal-scanner-effective-placebo <p>How does a financial services conference expecting thousands of attendees coming into the US from more than 130 countries try to keep participants safe from Ebola? It takes their temperature. </p> <p>Sibos, a gathering of financial experts being held in Boston this week, emailed attendees on Monday, before the disclosure of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/first-ebola-case-texas-what-we-know">first case of Ebola to be diagnosed in the US</a>, to inform them that it would, in addition to its typical metal detectors, be employing “thermal scanners” at each entrance to the conference “to detect elevated body temperatures and possible infectious diseases”.</p> <p>The idea behind using these scanners, most models of which look like a smaller version of the radar guns police use to catch speeding motorists, is that they can detect people who have a fever, one of the symptoms of Ebola, as well as many other infectious agents. </p> <p>This kind of screening has long been used as part of the response to outbreaks like Ebola, Sars and influenza. People flying out of the West African countries where the Ebola epidemic is currently centered have their temperatures taken before boarding, and if it is elevated, they are tested for the virus. </p> <p>Whether doing this – and especially by way of these scanners – is effective is another matter. Some researchers have called the scanners reassuring, and not much more. </p> <p>Checking body temperature isn’t a sure-fire way to find individuals infected with Ebola. People can carry the virus for up to three weeks before showing symptoms, and are not contagious during that period. The patient in the US case, Thomas Eric Duncan, was reportedly asymptomatic when he travelled from Liberia to Dallas. </p> <p>In a guidance paper produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for airport and public health officials, the agency lists what it sees as problems with the devices, including cost, lack of precision, need for frequent calibration and maintenance and training requirements. Testing efficacy to judge the scanners write large is difficult because of the many and changing models available. </p> <p>While such scanners can be good at ruling out people without fevers, the CDC said, they have a wide and varying range of efficacy at finding people with fevers depending on environmental conditions and even the age of the person being scanned. The FDA approved the devices for use only with more conventional methods of taking someone’s temperature, such as a mercury thermometer or color-changing strips. </p> <p>“Policy makers may feel some pressure to use [non-contact infrared thermometers],” said <a href="http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19115">French researchers at the Institut de Veille Sanitaire</a>. “But the decision making process should not ignore the poor scientific evidence on NCIT’s efficacy to delay the introduction of a novel influenza strain.”</p> <p>“The psychological reassuring effect on the public can influence the decision to implement such screening, as was the case in Singapore and Canada,” said the same study from Institut de Veille Sanitaire. “But these countries also recognised that the public may lose confidence in this measure if an undetected case had entered the country and generated secondary cases.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/ebola-us-doctors-texas-liberia <p>The first patient to be diagnosed with Ebola outside Africa told medical staff that he had recently travelled from west Africa, but was not admitted to hospital until he returned two days later, health officials in Texas said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Thomas Eric Duncan told a nurse at a Dallas emergency room that he had recently visited Liberia, which has been ravaged by the Ebola outbreak. But an executive at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital told a news conference that the information was not widely enough shared with the medical team treating Duncan, and he was diagnosed as suffering from a “low-grade common viral disease”.</p> <p>Duncan’s sister, Mai Wureh, told the Associated Press that he first visited the emergency room on Friday, but was sent home with a course of antibiotics – an outcome that hospital chiefs described as a matter of “regret”.</p> <p>Duncan was admitted to hospital when he returned two days later. He was described as being in a serious but stable condition on Wednesday.</p> <p>Officials said they are monitoring 12 to 18 people who may have come into contact with Duncan, including five school-age children and three members of the Dallas-Forth Worth ambulance crew that transported him to the hospital. The crew members tested negative for the disease but have been sent home as a precaution, city officials confirmed on Wednesday.</p> <p>Speaking in the parking lot of the apartment complex where Duncan was staying, Mesud Osmanovic, a 21-year-old manual labourer who lives there, said he saw the ambulance arrive. </p> <p>“When the ambulance came his whole family were all screaming, he got outside and he was throwing up all over the place … when he was throwing up he was trying to walk and he couldn’t walk,” Osmanovic said. He said he had met Duncan only a couple of times but knew him as kind and helpful to residents. “I know him through his family … This ain’t his first time coming to America,” he said. “He was a quiet guy, a really nice guy.”</p> <p>Apparently to stop media from entering, the main way in to the complex was blocked by armed private security guards who said they had been hired at the request of the owners. The complex is located in Dallas’ Vickery Meadows district less than a mile from the hospital where Duncan is a patient. </p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-038c2b8d-4a4c-43a4-a7ef-be490a583393"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/1/1412197755967/ac899d71-9766-4456-8acb-842d21649ea9-460x276.jpeg" alt="Ebola Texas apartments" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">A private security guard patrols the apartments where the confirmed Ebola virus patient was staying.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Tom Pennington/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ebola has so far killed more than 3,000 people in west Africa since the outbreak began in March, according to the World Health Organisation.

Duncan began developing symptoms, which can include high fever, vomiting and diarrhoea, on 24 September, and visited the Texas Health Presbyterian hospital two days later. </p> <p>Mark Lester, a senior executive at Texas Health Resources, which operates the hospital where Duncan is being treated, said medical staff used an Ebola checklist, which included a question about travel history. “That checklist was utilised by the nurse who did ask that question,” Lester said.<br /></p> <p>The nurse was part of a “complex care team” in the emergency department, Lester said, adding: “Regretfully, that information was not fully communicated throughout the full team. As a result the full import of that question was not factored in to the clinical decision-making.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="e7e606dec6c4493c06e2510c9baeef47567ac3a6"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/1/1412197310239/4aa72c2f-f09b-40da-bd70-adabc87ca43c-460x276.jpeg" alt="Mark Lester, southeast zone clinical leader for Texas Health Resources, speaks at a media conference in Dallas." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Mark Lester, southeast zone clinical leader for Texas Health Resources, speaks at a media conference in Dallas.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: MIKE STONE/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That failure led staff to conclude that Duncan’s symptoms were “not yet typical” for Ebola and concluded that he was suffering from a “low-grade common viral disease”.</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the federal public health agency, recommends healthcare facilities treat all patients showing symptoms of Ebola, who have recently been to an affected west African country, as “potential cases and obtain additional history”.</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/africa/ebola-victim-texas-thomas-eric-duncan.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=HpSum&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">New York Times reported on Wednesday t</a>hat Duncan had come into contact with people suffering from Ebola in Liberia, four days before he travelled to the US. He helped a pregnant woman in Monrovia, who was showing signs of the disease, to get to hospital when an ambulance was not available.</p> <p>David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas department of state health services, attempted to allay public concern. “This is not west Africa. This is a very sophisticated city, a very sophisticated hospital and the dynamics are so significantly different than they are in west Africa that the chances of it being spread very, very, very small.”</p> <p>Later on Wednesday a spokeswoman for United Airlines said the carrier believed it flew Duncan from Brussels to Dallas-Fort Worth via Washington on 20 September, based on information provided to the airline by federal officials. The CDC said there was “zero risk of transmission” on these two flights because the patient showed no symptoms at the time and therefore could not have been contagious, the spokeswoman added. </p> <p>There was little panic among commuters at a bus stop across the street from the hospital. Billy Herman, 62, said that he was worried “to some degree, yes, but I have confidence in the CDC, that they have a standard process in place, [and] that they’re doing a traceback to see who he’s come in contact with.</p> <p>“I am confident in the healthcare system in America and that if other individuals are infected, if they start having symptoms that we can control it and it won’t be mass death, fear and destruction like in those third world countries,” he said, adding that he would move away if sat close to someone with flu-like symptoms.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="The spread of Ebola">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1412167449450/Ebola-map.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The CDC has sent a nine-member team to Texas to assist local and state officials. “If anyone develops fever, we’ll immediately isolate them to stop the chain of transmission,” said Tom Frieden, director of the CDC.</p> <p>Duncan will continue receiving treatment at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital of Dallas, even though it is not one of the four hospitals in the US equipped with biomedical isolation unit. Frieden said at the press conference that any hospital is capable of providing the proper care and control needed to treat and contain Ebola-stricken patients. The hospital has designated an entire ward for Duncan.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a US doctor who was exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone is under observation at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical centre in Bethesda, Maryland.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/saudi-arabia-ebola-hajj-pilgrimage <p>Saudi Arabia has made contingency plans in the event of an Ebola outbreak, including deploying medical staff at airports and setting up isolation units as nearly three million Muslims from across the world flock to perform the hajj pilgrimage.</p> <p>Adel al-Faqih, the Saudi health minister, said precautionary steps have been taken to prevent pilgrims with Ebola from entering the country as well as dealing with an emergency, local media have reported. He said there has been no diagnosed case of Ebola so far among pilgrims who have made it to Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>According to the minister, Jeddah has coordinated with international health bodies, including the World Health Organisation (WHO), and the countries where Ebola has struck to protect the annual pilgrimage that takes place in the last month of the Islamic calendar. Earlier in the year, Saudi Arabia had announced it will not issue visas to pilgrims coming from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea due to the spread of Ebola in those countries.</p> <p>Hundreds of health officials have been deployed in international airports and more than 22,000 general practitioners assigned to deal with the pilgrims.</p> <p>According to Abdel-Wahab Shalabi, a health official, 24 isolation units have been planed in the case of an outbreak as well as emergency rooms, surgery units and other facilities needed to treat patients.</p> <p>At airports, Saudi officials are showing extra care to check foreign planes. At least 205 flights had been closely monitored so far, according to an official at King Abdulaziz international airport, Abdulghani Al-Malki.</p> <p>“We have double-checked the papers that prove the aeroplanes had been sprayed twice before taking off to their destinations,” Al-Malki said, according to the English-language news website Saudi Gazette.</p> <p>The news site said: “Recent statistics by health centres showed that all the pilgrims who arrived at the King Abdulaziz International Airport were free from these diseases.”</p> <p>Earlier in the month, the Saudi Gazette reported that two special lounges had been dedicated to pilgrims coming from Nigeria and certain other African countries.</p> <p>“So far 118,000 pilgrims have arrived by air from Nigeria. There was not a single suspected case of the deadly virus among them,” al-Malki reportedly told Al-Watan at the time.</p> <p>“We are particularly checking pilgrims coming from countries with reported cases of Ebola including Nigeria, Kenya and Congo,” he said. “The trained and well-equipped medical teams board the planes immediately after landing. With the help of the crew, the teams will be looking at all passengers to see if any of them show symptoms of the virus.” According to al-Maliki pilgrims are asked to show which places they had visited in the last 21 days prior to their arrival and those suspected to have Ebola would be immediately transferred to King Fahd hospital in Jeddah.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="186a7567b41dc82802ddbae3d693c4f7880dae19"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/1/1412184403434/fbb4216d-bfb0-4d04-a74f-7271b3b52936-460x276.jpeg" alt="Muslim pilgrims arrive to take part in the Jamarat ritual " width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Muslim pilgrims arrive to take part in the Jamarat ritual, October 2012.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Fayez Nureldine/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Arab News reported on Wednesday that some 15,000 pilgrims had arrived through the sea port in Jeddah but some 100 health staff were deployed to examine them before they could set foot on the Saudi soil.</p> <p>Last month, Saudi Arabia said it had no plan to prevent pilgrims from Nigeria to participate in the hajj.</p> <p>“We have not stopped issuing hajj visas to Nigerians and we know that about 70,000 pilgrims come from the African country every year,” said Mohammed Al-Khasheem, the deputy health minister. “We have taken precautionary measures to prevent an Ebola outbreak in the [Saudi] Kingdom during the hajj season,” he said, according to Arab News. “We have made early preparations for the annual pilgrimage.”</p> <p>Many countries have issued separate instructions on how potential hajj visitors should be vigilant. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned that more than 11,000 Americans visit Saudi Arabia for hajj every year and asked those travelling to make health appointments a few weeks before the ritual, follow its food and water safety guidelines, prevent mosquito bites, use insect repellent, use disposable blades for head shaving and avoid swimming in fresh water.</p> <p>In August, a Saudi man who was suspected to have died as a result of Ebola infection was buried in the capital. He was later identified as Ibrahim al-lZahrani, a businessman.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/ebola-case-diagnosed-us-officials-texas-virus <p>The first patient to be diagnosed with Ebola outside Africa during the latest outbreak was sent home with a course of antibiotics for two days after seeking medical care at a Dallas hospital last week, a hospital official said.</p> <p>The patient, believed to be male, was admitted to an isolation unit at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital on Sunday, after coming to the same hospital two days before. </p> <p>Edward Goodman, the infectious disease specialist at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital, told National Public Radio that the patient’s symptoms were not definitive when he was first seen. Goodman said: “He was evaluated for his illness, which was very nondescript. He had some laboratory tests, which were not very impressive, and he was dismissed with some antibiotics.”</p> <p>Medical officials in the US announced on Tuesday that tests confirmed the man, who had travelled from Liberia, had Ebola.</p> <p>Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the patient was being treated in strict isolation and that all measures would be taken to ensure that the disease would not spread in the US.</p> <p>“I have no doubt that we will control this case of Ebola so that it does not spread widely in this country,” he told a news conference. The disease has spread rapidly in west Africa, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-ebola-crisis-briefing">killing more than 3,000 people</a> since March.</p> <p>However, US authorities are expected to be questioned over why the patient was not isolated immediately when he first arrived at the Texas hospital on Friday.</p> <p>Only patients who are sick with or have died from Ebola can transmit the disease, and it can only be spread through direct contact with blood or bodily fluids. The patient began developing symptoms, which can include high fever, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, as well as internal and external bleeding, on 24 September. He sought treatment for the first time on 26 September but was not admitted to hospital until two days later.</p> <p>Frieden acknowledged that other people who came into contact with the patient could develop the disease. “It is certainly possible that someone who had contact with this individual ... could develop Ebola in the coming weeks,” he said.</p> <p>In Dallas, leaders of the 10,000-strong Liberian community were urging calm but told people to be cautious.<br /></p> <p>Stanley Gaye, president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, said the Liberian population in north Texas is skeptical of the CDC’s assurances, because Ebola has ravaged their country.</p> <p> “We’ve been telling people to try to stay away from social gatherings,” Gaye said at a community meeting on Tuesday evening. Large get-togethers are a prominent part of Liberian culture.</p> <p>“We need to know who it is so that [family members] can all go get tested,” Gaye told the Associated Press. “If they are aware, they should let us know.”</p> <p>The association’s vice-president encouraged all who may have come into contact with the virus to visit a doctor, but she warned people not to panic.</p> <p>“We don’t want to get a panic going,” said vice president Roseline Sayon. “We embrace those people who are coming forward. Don’t let the stigma keep you from getting tested.”</p> <p>Frieden said the CDC believed it was the first case of Ebola to be diagnosed outside Africa in the latest outbreak. “This is the first patient diagnosed outside of Africa to our knowledge with this particular strain of Ebola,” he said.</p> <p>Few details were released about the patient. The patient’s gender was not confirmed, but officials repeatedly used the male personal pronoun at the CDC briefing. The CDC would only confirm that the he was not involved in the public health response to the crisis in Liberia, and was visiting family in the US. His citizenship was not disclosed.</p> <p>The White House said the president had been briefed. “The president and Director Frieden discussed the stringent isolation protocols under which the patient is being treated, as well as ongoing efforts to trace the patient’s contacts to mitigate the risk of additional cases,” a White House spokesman said.</p> <p>Specimens from the patient arrived at the CDC in Atlanta on Tuesday, where tests determined he was suffering from Ebola. A state-operated laboratory in Texas also concluded that the specimens tested positive for Ebola. Frieden said testing for Ebola is “highly accurate”.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Dallas County health and human services department told the Guardian that it will be “conducting a public health follow-up” on the patient which will include investigating travel history and recent contacts.</p> <p>Friedman said there was “zero risk” that the patient could have transmitted the disease on the flight from Liberia to the US, because he was not infectious at the time. </p> <p>Health officials in Texas attempted to reassure residents. Dr David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas department of state health services, told the CDC briefing: “We have no other suspected cases in the state of Texas at this time.”<br /></p> <p>Zachary S Thompson, the Dallas county director of health and human services, said: “Dallas County residents should be aware that the public health is our No1 priority. Our staff will continue to work hard to protect the health and welfare of the citizens in Dallas county.”</p> <p>The Texas patient is the fifth to receive treatment for Ebola in the US. Aid workers Dr Kent Brantly of Texas and Nancy Writebol were the first Ebola patients to be treated in the US.</p> <p>Brantly and Writebol were treated in a bio-containment unit at Emory University hospital in Atlanta. The recovered after receiving doses of an experimental drug which has since been depleted. Brantly recently testified before Congress, imploring the international community to step up its response to the outbreak.</p> <p>Dr Rick Sacra, the third US aid worker to contract Ebola while working at a hospital in Monrovia, was released from Nebraska medical center last week.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/first-ebola-patient-us-no-zmapp <p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/first-ebola-case-diagnosed-us" title="">Ebola patient in Dallas</a> will not be given ZMapp, the experimental drug used to treat several international aid workers and medical staff, including at least two Americans, because stocks have run out.</p> <p>ZMapp is one of the drugs that is being rushed into trials in the epidemic, along with other drugs that will need more safety data in animals and humans before they are administered to patients.</p> <p>There have been very few doses available and stocks have all been used up, but the San Diego-based company behind ZMapp is pressing ahead with the manufacture of more supplies. It is not an easy drug to make, however. It includes three man-made antibodies to the virus which are grown in tobacco leaves and take months to produce.</p> <p>There is no proven drug treatment for Ebola viral disease. Until this year, outbreaks were sporadic, usually fairly swiftly contained and restricted to Africa. The few drugs in research and development for the disease were either still in the laboratory or had been tested only on animals.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Map of Ebola outbreaks">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1412167449450/Ebola-map.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>When the epidemic in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-ebola-crisis-briefing" title="">spiralled out of control</a> and it was clear that many health workers, including foreigners, were getting sick, the most advanced of these experimental drugs, ZMapp, was pulled out of the cupboard. It was given to two Americans – one a doctor working in west Africa with the charitable organisation the Samaritan’s Purse and the other a missionary. Dr <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/21/american-ebola-discharged-hospital-kent-brantly" title="">Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol recovered</a>. However, a Spanish priest, Miguel Pajares, also given ZMapp, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ebola-spanish-missionary-dies-madrid-liberia" title="">died in hospital in Madrid</a>.</p> <p>William Pooley, the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2014/sep/03/british-ebola-survivor-william-pooley-video" title="">British nurse evacuated to the UK with Ebola</a>, also received ZMapp and survived, but a Liberian doctor, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/25/liberian-doctor-ebola-drug-trial-zmapp-dies" title="Guardian: Doctor dies">Abraham Borbor</a>, who was given the drug died.</p> <p>ZMapp performed well in animal trials. A recent study in Nature showed that it had protected 100% of monkeys given the drug. But because the trial took place before the current outbreak, they were not exposed to the Zaire strain that is killing people in west Africa now.</p> <p>Brantly and possibly some of the other foreigners were also given plasma from people who had <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/04/ebola-experts-antibodies-survivors-blood-potential-cure" title="">survived Ebola, and therefore had antibodies</a> to the virus in their blood. That is a route the World Health Organisation is now exploring, although it may be difficult in a west African setting.</p> <p>When the flu pandemic scare hit the US and Europe, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/10/tamiflu-saga-drug-trials-big-pharma" title="">people rushed to buy stocks of the antiviral drug, Tamiflu</a>. This time there is no drug available – either to treat or to protect people against infection. Drug and vaccine trials are being set up in west Africa at record speed, but it will still take months and probably into next year before scientists and doctors have any real idea of whether anything works.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/ebola-us-risks-response-first-case <p>As the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the US sends shockwaves through healthcare systems across every state, questions will be asked as to why the man, who flew in from Liberia on 20 September, was not tested and isolated as soon as he presented at the Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas six days later.</p> <p>Instead, he was allowed home, where his condition grew rapidly worse and he was eventually transferred by ambulance on Sunday.</p> <p>The first symptoms of Ebola are very similar to those of colds and flu, so the man may have arrived with no more than a fever. No details of the patient have been released, but the absence of suspicion on the part of medical staff suggests he may not be from west Africa and did not tell them that he had recently been there.</p> <p>Public health experts involved in the battle to control the epidemic raging in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia say the biggest problem is that people are not diagnosed until too late, when they have spread the infection, often to many other people. The Dallas case shows how easily that can happen when the index of suspicion is low.</p> <p>If any hospital in the US had been complacent about Ebola, they will not be so now. The unnamed patient became a greater risk to those around him the longer he was out in the community. People with Ebola are not infectious until symptoms develop. As time goes on, and they sweat, vomit and lose control of their bodily functions, they become more and more infectious. The virus is spread in body fluids and any surfaces contaminated by them.</p> <p>The Dallas patient will have posed less of a risk to other people when he first turned up at hospital and was sent home than two days later, when the ambulance was summoned. The paramedics who transported him will now be closely monitored for symptoms and the ambulance itself will have to be decontaminated.</p> <p>The man showed no symptoms on his flight from west Africa and will not have infected anybody else during it, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which confirmed the Ebola case after laboratory testing. Public health officials will have already embarked on tracing every contact since he arrived on US soil, and particularly those over the last few days.</p> <p>Every contact will be asked to stay at home and health workers will monitor them. They will be asked to report any signs of fever or other illness.</p> <p>Those in the house where the man was staying and who may have helped nurse him are at greatest risk. It is not possible to contract Ebola without physical contact with somebody who has it or surfaces they have touched, including cutlery and the lavatory. The virus can incubate for up to 21 days without causing symptoms. Paramedics taking extreme precautions, including the use of protective suits, will take anyone who becomes ill to an isolation unit.</p> <p>Contact tracing, carried out promptly and efficiently, can and does bring epidemics to a halt. That is how previous outbreaks of Ebola have been contained. Nigeria has just shown how well it can work, even in a very difficult situation in which the infection had been brought into a crowded city. The CDC said on Tuesday that Nigeria’s epidemic was probably over. It began when a US citizen, Patrick Sawyer, flew in to Lagos, became ill and died five days later. One of his contacts fled to Port Harcourt and sparked an outbreak there. Prompt action by Nigerian health officials, assisted by the CDC, led to the tracing of 900 contacts. There have been 20 probable cases and eight deaths. All but three of the contacts are now out of the incubation period and the rest will be clear on Thursday. Senegal has also kept out the epidemic after tracing and monitoring 67 contacts of the one person from Guinea who crossed its border with the disease.</p> <p>The CDC points out that the US has successfully contained diseases similar to Ebola before. It has had five imported cases of haemorrhagic fever in the past – four of Lassa fever and one of Marburg. In all those cases, every contact was traced and no transmission of the virus occurred.</p> <p>Not all hospitals in the US are prepared, however, the biggest nurses’ organisation claims. National Nurses United (NNU) surveyed registered nurses in a dozen states. More than 60% said their hospital was not prepared for Ebola and 80% said it had not communicated any policy on the admission of patients suspected of suffering from disease. More than a quarter said their hospital did not have enough protective equipment, such as eye masks and fluid-resistant gowns, and 85% said their hospital had not educated them on the disease.</p> <p>At a rally in Las Vegas last week to protest about inadequate preparations in US hospitals, the NNU’s executive director, RoseAnn DeMoro, said a dramatic response was needed immediately. “When these patients come to your hospital, it’s not going to be the corporations or the people on Capitol Hill who are going to be there, it’s nurses, and unless we have adequate preparation, we’re putting people in harm’s way,” she said.</p> <p>Professor Tom Solomon, the director of the UK’s health protection research unit in emerging infections based at the University of Liverpool, said: “This is worrying news about the virus’ spread to America for the first time. But in fact work we have been doing at … the University of Liverpool predicted that America was one of the countries at greatest risk of importing the disease. This was based on our knowledge of airline passenger travel.</p> <p>“Although it is worrying that Ebola has spread beyond Africa in this way, the chances of it becoming established in America or other western countries is very small. This is because unlike the affected countries in western Africa, we have well established systems in place which can contain such a disease.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/01/us-ebola-cheap-value-african-lives <p>The life of a westerner is judged to be of greater worth than that of a black African – and by a number of factors, too. That it’s such a statement of the obvious, rendered glib, met with an instinctive “Well, duh”, simply underlines the point. And so it is unsurprising that the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/first-ebola-case-diagnosed-us" title="">case of Ebola in the US</a> should attract headlines. We do not know yet whether the patient is a US citizen - but the widespread media attention is due to the threat being transported to US soil and therefore putting westerners at risk.</p> <p>That is not to belittle the suffering of the victim, and I hope the treatment that has been successful with the westerners who contracted the virus returns them to good health. But in due course, we will undoubtedly learn more personal details about this victim treated in a Dallas hospital than we know about the 3,000-plus Africans who have so far perished.</p> <p>When aid workers have succumbed to Ebola, they have been invariably flown out and given ZMapp, an experimental drug that seems to have saved their lives. British nurse William Pooley is one and – having been flown out and saved – <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/09/william-pooley-ebola-sierra-leone-outbreak-epidemic" title="">he wants to return</a>. But this treatment is denied to Africans dying from an agonising hemorrhagic fever, which leaves victims bleeding on both the outside and the inside.</p> <p>One defence of this practice is straightforward. The safety and effectiveness of ZMapp has not been proven through clinical trials. For westerners to start using such a drug on African victims – with consequences we cannot be entirely confident about – would risk claims that pharmaceutical companies are using Liberians and Sierra Leoneans as experimental fodder. But it has, after all, already been judged to be worth using on westerners. No wonder human rights activists in Africa are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/health/in-ebola-outbreak-who-should-get-experimental-drug.html" title="">saying that it proves that</a> “the life of an African is less valuable”.</p> <p>My colleague <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/15/ebola-doctor-death-olivet-buck-sierra-leone" title="">Joseph Harker wrote two weeks</a> ago about his brother-in-law’s sister, Olivet Buck, a Sierra Leonean doctor risking her life to help the dying. When she contracted the disease, a campaign was mounted to evacuate her to Germany where a hospital in Hamburg was ready to take her. But the World Health Organisation refused to fund such a lifesaving move, and Dr Buck died.</p> <p>According to Médecins Sans Frontières, the western response has been “lethally inadequate”. But you can be sure that if such an epidemic had broken out in, say, Chicago, Paris or Rome, every possible resource available to the western medical world would be thrown at the problem.</p> <p>But instead the western response too often has been “what about us?”. The Bloomberg Businessweek carries an alarmist <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Byz1MW_IMAAbQbO.jpg:large" title="">Ebola Is Coming</a> front cover. This is a nonsense. Ebola is a disease of poverty. It is very difficult to spread, and depends on direct contact with the bodily fluids of the infected, rather than being an airborne (and thus catastrophic) illness. If Liberia had a functioning public health system, the epidemic would be shut down. It needs trained health workers, isolation wards and protective gear to combat it – infrastructure that, in our grossly unequal world, simply is not there in a countries like Liberia or Sierra Leone. In Nigeria and Senegal, where there is a far more effective public health system, the countries appear to have put a stop to the onward march of Ebola. The disease has no real chance of spreading in western countries, because any victims would be quickly isolated and treated.</p> <p>The sad reality is that African victims will continue to suffer an excruciating death, denied of basic dignity, drowning in their own fluids. As they do so, they will remain nameless and forgotten, except to their forever mourning relatives. Westerners, on the other hand, will be flown out, treated and become near-celebrities. Perhaps some are resigned to such a disparity, believing that this is the inevitable way of the world. I tend to differ: it is perverse, and it is unjust.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/30/ebola-dallas-spreading-across-america <p>In the immortal words of <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/">Douglas Adams</a>, Don’t Panic. </p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced on Tuesday evening that a patient undergoing treatment in the United States does, indeed, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/first-ebola-case-diagnosed-us">have the Ebola virus</a>. Nearly two weeks ago, the traveler left Liberia, one of the West African countries at the center of the current Ebola outbreak, and flew back to Texas – asymptomatic at that point. This is key, because Ebola spreads <em>when a person is exhibiting symptoms</em>. At the time of that flight, the patient was not ill. And when the patient later reported to a hospital in Dallas, doctors there <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/first-ebola-case-texas-what-we-know">quickly suspected it was Ebola and put the patient into isolation</a>. Those who came into contact since the patient’s arrival are being traced as a precaution and will be watched for symptoms for three weeks – the incubation period of the virus. Odds are good those contacts do not include you, and your odds of dying of Ebola in the US <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/what-would-happen-if-someone-got-ebola-in-america/375928/">are lower than your chances of dying on a rollercoaster</a>.<br /></p> <p>It’s not out of the realm of possibility that we’ll see other cases here in the US, but, seriously: relax. We got this.<br /></p> <p><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2014/08/02/ebola-is-already-in-the-united-states/">Ebola is already here in the United States</a>. It’s existed in labs for decades, among researchers and experimental primates and other animals with no spread out into the open. And based on models of <a href="http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/assessing-the-international-spreading-risk-associated-with-the-2014-west-african-ebola-outbreak/">travel patterns published earlier this month</a>, we already knew that an imported case of Ebola might make its way here. Hospitals across the country <a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1899515">have been busy preparing</a>, and there have been a few suspected cases that ended up testing negative, so we’ve already had test runs in <a href="http://www.wkrn.com/story/26201803/46-year-old-woman-hospitalized-tested-for-possible-ebola">Ohio</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/nyregion/new-york-patient-tests-negative-for-ebola.html?_r=0">New York</a>, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/California-patient-being-tested-for-Ebola-had-5701892.php">California</a> and other areas.</p> <p>We saw it coming. We have great infection control officers in our hospitals who have been watching the outbreak unfold from afar. Our hospitals are trained better than ever. Your cousin from Dallas is <em>not</em> going to turn your town into a scene from 28 Days Later.</p> <p>Of course, we’ve also brought medical workers home to the US for Ebola treatment, at <a href="http://news.emory.edu/stories/2014/07/euh_ebola_patient/campus.html">Emory</a> near CDC headquarters in Atlanta, and in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/25/health/ebola-american-patient/">Nebraska</a>, where a physician was released on Thursday <a href="http://www.boston.com/health/2014/09/25/mass-doctor-has-recovered-from-ebola-released-from-nebraska-hospital/mRmYgBlI3fOrTohAeIIqAI/story.html">and is doing just fine</a>, thanks. Despite the initial public outcry, no medical staff or other hospital workers have become ill after caring for these patients, and no one else in their communities has been put at risk. The Ebola virus is easily controlled with the prevention measures and healthcare infrastructure we have in developed countries like the US. </p> <p>Be concerned for those in the affected areas of West Africa and Central Africa, but, really: do not lose sleep about the potential for Ebola to spread across the US. It’s not going to.<br /></p> <p>Even if this new Dallas case <em>hadn’t</em> been suspected and diagnosed as rapidly as it was, the risk was still low for spread in the US. We already had one <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5849a2.htm">imported case of another filovirus</a> – an Ebola “cousin” called Marburg – back in 2008, in Colorado. That patient wasn’t surrounded by an entire nation’s preponderance of precautions; that patient didn’t even receive her definitive diagnosis until <em>a full year</em> after it was resolved – and that was only because <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2014/08/02/ebola-is-already-in-the-united-states/">she herself had read about another traveler who had visited the same cave in Uganda</a>. After multiple trips to an outpatient clinic <em>and</em> to her local physician, the Marburg patient was finally admitted to a community hospital with a fever of unknown origin. <br /></p> <p>Even when someone in the US suffered from almost-Ebola – even when they weren’t in isolation, even when they didn’t get a CDC press conference – no one else ended up infected. <br /></p> <p>The situation in Africa is quite different. The medical infrastructure there can be poor to non-existent. Organizations such as <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/our-work/medical-issues/ebola">Doctors without Borders</a> have been leading the fight against the virus, but they’re exhausted, overworked, understaffed and working in incredible heat and generally miserable conditions. They’re <a href="http://www.msf.org/article/msf-addresses-un-security-council-emergency-session-ebola">turning away patients</a> because they lack beds and are <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/ebola-obama-msf-speeches-not-enough">begging for an infusion</a> of cash, supplies and personnel. In the US, we have all of that in spades.<br /></p> <p>It’s natural to dread death and to fear the exotic, the unknown. But we can’t let our fears – particularly when they’re not rational – overwhelm the global response that is so necessary, right now. That response requires calm, for patients here in the US and abroad. What we need is the opposite of panic. ​</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/ebola-sierra-leone-20m-funding-uk-britain <p>The UK will spend a further £20m on the care of Ebola patients and prevention of the disease in Sierra Leone, in addition to the £100m it has already committed, the government has announced.</p> <p>The extra funding from the Department for International Development comes before an international conference called by the UK and Sierra Leonean governments in London on Thursday to discuss what other countries can do to help.</p> <p>The international development secretary, Justine Greening, said the money was needed to keep basic public health services running, as well as allowing hard-pressed aid agencies to continue to help Ebola victims and fight the spread of disease.</p> <p>“Britain is working urgently with Sierra Leone to scale up the international response to the disease,” said Greening. “Last month Britain pledged to support 700 treatment beds in Sierra Leone, but keeping basic public health services running is vital to halt the spread of the disease. Our latest support will allow stretched medical staff and aid agencies to prevent further infection.”</p> <p>The new money was announced as a rare piece of good news on Ebola emerged from the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC), which said the outbreak in Nigeria was probably over. When Patrick Sawyer, an American who flew to Lagos from Liberia in July, was taken ill and died five days later, there were fears that the epidemic would sweep through the capital and later Port Harcourt, where one of Sawyer’s contacts fled.</p> <p>The CDC said swift and effective action in tracing the contacts of the two men had paid off. Only three out of 900 contacts are still in the 21-day incubation period and that expires . There have been 20 cases in the country and eight deaths.</p> <p>Senegal is also clear of Ebola. It had just one confirmed case – a man who travelled from Guinea – but immediate action by the health ministry, which was prepared for the eventuality, led to the successful tracing of all 67 of his contacts. All are now out of the virus incubation period.</p> <p>The CDC called on all countries in the region to ensure they are prepared in case the Ebola outbreak should spread across their borders.</p> <p>In the three badly affected countries and, in particular, Sierra Leone and Liberia, there is no sign of a respite.</p> <p>There is major concern at the rate of increase in Ebola cases in Sierra Leone, where the UK is taking the lead. At the moment, every 10 people with Ebola will pass the infection to 17 more, which means the numbers are almost doubling every few weeks. To bring the infection rate down, it is necessary to get medical care to people much faster, before they become highly infectious.</p> <p>Small tented facilities are to be set up on a trial basis in areas where there has never been healthcare or it has broken down, with the aim of encouraging people who have symptoms such as fever – which could be malaria or Ebola – to come for basic care. Those who test positive for Ebola will be isolated and could be moved to a hospital bed, if there is one available and transport to get them there.</p> <p>The extra £20m will provide chlorine, protective suits, essential water and sanitation, and enable experts from Public Health England and other organisations to support the efforts of the Sierra Leonean government, UN and aid agencies.</p> <p>At least 3,700 children have been orphaned by Ebola in west Africa, according to Unicef, which warned that they were being rejected by their communities.</p> <p>“These children urgently need special attention and support, yet many of them feel unwanted and even abandoned,” said Manuel Fontaine, Unicef’s regional director for west and central Africa.</p> <p>“Orphans are usually taken in by a member of the extended family, but in some communities, the fear surrounding Ebola is becoming stronger than family ties.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/ebola-orphans-west-africa-guinea-liberia-sierra-leone <p>Thousands of children in west Africa have been orphaned by Ebola and are at risk of becoming outcasts from communities frightened of the infectious disease, according to Unicef.</p> <p>At least 3,700 children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have lost one or both parents to Ebola since the outbreak began, says Unicef, which predicts the numbers will double by mid-October.</p> <p>“Thousands of children are living through the deaths of their mother, father or family members from Ebola,” said Manuel Fontaine, Unicef’s regional director for west and central Africa. “These children urgently need special attention and support, yet many of them feel unwanted and even abandoned. Orphans are usually taken in by a member of the extended family, but in some communities the fear surrounding Ebola is becoming stronger than family ties.”</p> <p>Unicef, the UN children’s agency, is training health and social workers to support children in affected countries. In Sierra Leone, more than 2,500 Ebola survivors – who are now immune to the disease – will be trained to provide care and support to quarantined children in treatment centres. The organisation is also working with partners to reunite separated children with their relatives through a nationwide family-tracing network, which also provides children with psychosocial support.</p> <p>“Ebola is turning a basic human reaction like comforting a sick child into a potential death sentence,” Fontaine said. “The vast majority of the children affected by Ebola are still left without appropriate care. We cannot respond to a crisis of this nature and this scale in the usual ways. We need more courage, more creativity, and far far more resources.”</p> <p>As of 26 September, 6,553 people had been infected with Ebola in west Africa, of whom 3,083 have died. The true death toll is thought to be higher – 70% rather than 50% – when those who had not been admitted to hospital are included. Although there is no effective treatment, rehydration and good care gives people a better chance of survival.</p> <p>Efforts are under way to build more treatment centres and train more nursing staff.</p> <p>International volunteers are heading to west Africa in significant numbers to support the fight against Ebola. Cuba has promised 300 doctors and nurses.</p> <p>There have been 400 volunteers from the NHS, who will have to be approved and trained before they can fly to affected areas.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/sep/29/media-and-communications-the-first-line-of-defence-against-ebola <p>Misinformation is hampering efforts to tackle the Ebola outbreak in west Africa as rumours and speculation exacerbate the epidemic. In such a climate, local media can help to save lives.</p> <p>In recent weeks, fear and misunderstanding have claimed new kinds of victims, including the three journalists killed in Womme, Guinea, along with five health workers, after they were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-29256443">attacked by villagers so terrified of the disease </a>that they feared any outsider could infect their village.</p> <p>In Womme, a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-attack-ebola-guinea-outreach-20140918-story.html">local policeman</a> said villagers believe that Ebola is nothing more than an invention of white people, to kill black people.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="http://en.ria.ru/world/20140922/193168220/Liberian-Official-Ebola-Misinformation-Hampering-Efforts-to.html">a Liberian official said</a> misinformation is hampering efforts to tackle the outbreak there, citing rumours that an educational film shown to villagers is intended merely to distract people while officials literally poison the wells.</p> <p>In such a climate, it is vital that governments and the international community understand that epidemics are exacerbated by misinformation, and that medical efforts to combat the disease must be accompanied by work to curb the spread of rumours and false news.</p> <p>While “messaging campaigns” from governments and international aid workers are important, they are not enough. Unless trust has been established, getting the message “right” does not mean that it will be accepted.</p> <p>Credible sources of information in the local language have the greatest impact: this is why word-of-mouth is so powerful, often dangerously so. But it is also why local media can be so effective.</p> <p>Local journalists can expand the conversation beyond a one-way, top-down message from the authorities to people, and build dialogue – in addition to distributing useful information. A feeling of being heard, of having input, goes a long way towards building trust.</p> <p>René Sakèlè, a journalist with Radio Rurale in N’Zérékoré, Guinea, and member of a team working with Internews to produce a humanitarian radio programme on Ebola in Guinea, said the experience had helped to expand the journalists’ view on who is qualified to talk about the disease.</p> <p>“Today, I know that there are not only ‘official’ sources. There are also [health] experts, civil society, youth and women – who can all say something about Ebola,” Sakèlè said.</p> <p>Mara, a resident of Moty N’Zérékoré, said she had heard the programme, which addressed widespread fears that going to the hospital – for any reason – was unsafe.</p> <p>“I thought what people were saying was true. But the explanations of the chief doctor of the clinic allowed me to understand hospitals are not the source of the risk,” Mara said.</p> <p>Messaging alone will not convince people who have heard and believed rumours from their friends and families. It is only through building multiple, trusted forms of communication that we can turn the tide against misinformation, and local media must be tasked and entrusted with responsibility to do this.</p> <p>In order to be stewards of information, local journalists must have tools: the skills to understand and report on complex medical issues; the ability to seek out and rely on independent, qualified sources; the deftness to hear concerns and curate useful conversations; and the technique to make stories understandable and actionable to their audiences.</p> <p>It is not an easy job. Like the medical workers who put themselves at risk to aid the sick, these journalists should be regarded as heroes, combating the viral spread of a killer: the rumours and misinformation that put everybody at risk.</p> <p>Information can save lives. Through training, support and long-term mentoring, we have witnessed first-hand the ability of Kenyan journalists, for example, to turn a local understanding of HIV and Aids from a threat so terrifying that even families turned on and cast out those afflicted, to a public health issue that demands attention and response at the highest levels.</p> <p>Skilled journalists led communities through the scourge of avian flu. It can be done, but there is no time to waste.</p> <p>Journalists alone cannot turn the tide against Ebola, but they must be part of the solution.

http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/27/unreported-world-surviving-ebola-review-c4-sierra-leone-hospital <p>A makeshift jungle hospital – tents, corrugated iron roofs and bright orange barriers – looks more like some kind of sinister detention centre. The people here are even more sinister-looking, in orange plastic suits, white boots, green gloves, headdresses, masks, ski goggles, and not an inch of actual person visible; they could be aliens. But these are the staff, the doctors. They’re like this because we’re in Sierra Leone and this is <strong>Unreported World: Surviving Ebola</strong> (Channel 4).</p> <p>It looks like a nightmare. It is a nightmare – if anything, the title is misleadingly optimistic. The death ledger book is filling up. There have been 73 deaths in the past month alone. The body of the latest, a nine-year-old boy, still highly infectious, is carried to the morgue, a small bundle in a white plastic sheet. He will be buried round the back in a clearing that is rapidly running out of space.</p> <p>Victims have been hiding at home and infecting their families. More patients arrive, six members of one family, staggering out of an ambulance, very sick and very scared. The ambulances double up as hearses.</p> <p>Some people come in a van that is sprayed with chlorine after every journey. Like this mother and her daughter. But she, the mother is already dead. As her body is carried to the morgue, the seven-year-old child cries out: “I’m feeling cold, sir, I’m feeling cold.” A tiny utterance, but one of the saddest things I’ve ever heard. She dies later, too. The van is sprayed.</p> <p>And as if that wasn’t hell enough, there’s a rumour in the nearby town that Ebola is just a hoax, devised by doctors so that they can steal blood from people. They’re rioting. Civil unrest to add to the terror, vomit, blood, diarrhoea and death, while <a href="http://www.msf.org.uk/about-msf" title="">Médecins Sans Frontières</a> doctors fight a battle it appears they cannot win.</p> <p>Shaunagh Connaire and Wael Dabbous’s short film is a chilling and bleak one. It is also brave – there must have been some risk involved. And it is important. Of course you knew the Ebola story, but perhaps, like for me, it was just that – a news story, distant, and a name. This was a rude, visceral wake-up to the terrible reality.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/26/liberian-senate-transparency-ebola-funds <p>Stately and unassuming, Liberia’s national Ebola taskforce coordinator James Dorbor Jallah announced at a press conference in late August that the government’s initial $5m (£3m) contribution to contain the disease had been spent.</p> <p>As he fumbled with the numbers in his expenditures report, the blogosphere exploded with queries about how all that money could vanish so quickly. Now, the Liberian Senate is <a href="http://www.liberianobserver.com/politics/senate-requests-expenditure-report-us5m-ebola-fund">demanding full disclosure</a> of the Ebola funds’ whereabouts. To his credit, however, Jallah was attempting something that donors have yet to do: answer to the people in whose name “the war on Ebola” is being fought in west Africa. As we have seen all too often in international emergency response operations, the stakes are too high to forgo systems of accountability.</p> <p>Médecins sans Frontières, the leading health relief organisation in Liberia, has complained for weeks that resources committed to the Ebola crisis have been “<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/doctor-nigeria-ebola-victim-lagos">entirely insufficient</a>”. The latest projections from the UN indicate that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/16/ebola-outbreak-us-to-send-3000-troops-west-africa">almost $1bn</a> will be needed to contain the Ebola outbreak in west Africa. Significant amounts of money have now started pouring in, with the fanfare we have come to expect in such situations. But commitments have not been matched with relevant tools and reports to track the flows of promised aid disbursals.</p> <p>Last week, the Pentagon announced that it will divert $500m towards the Ebola relief effort. Last month, the EU announced €140m would be spent on treatment centres, the training of healthcare workers, mobile laboratory services, as well as budget support in the affected countries. The World Bank approved a $105m grant to help communities cope with economic hardship, among other challenges, and the WHO launched a $100m response plan.</p> <p>Donald Kaberuka, president of the African Development Bank, recently travelled to Sierra Leone and Liberia in a gesture of solidarity to pledge $60m, which he said would be channelled through the WHO for disease surveillance, case management, logistical support, and capacity building. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation followed suit by pledging $50m to support the UN and other international agencies.</p> <p>Other more modest donations were announced to buttress commitments by west African governments and leverage the outpouring of humanitarian aid from diaspora communities.</p> <p>Yet, as donors muscle their way to the front of the pledge line, they must account for how their aid is actually disbursed, managed and reported. Beneath the veneer of international humanitarianism lie fundamental questions about the accountability of aid.</p> <p>It is in times of emergency in recent years that the lack of accountability has been most apparent. More than four years after the earthquake in Haiti – and with a central role played by several former US presidents in coordinating relief efforts – it is hard to clarify exactly what happened to the $9bn in emergency aid. For example, one <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/breaking-open-the-black-box">review indicates</a> that only 0.9% of the more than $1bn pledged by USAid after the disaster has actually gone to Haitian organisations; while another <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/658445.pdf">US government report</a> (pdf) indicates that as of last year only 35% of pledged funds had actually been disbursed. Meanwhile, thousands of Haitians displaced by the disaster continue to live in makeshift housing, squalor and destitution.</p> <p>The aid industry is <a href="http://resetweb.org/international-development-please-drop-the-charity-act/">often criticised</a> for its lack of openness and effectiveness. While progress is being made – through efforts like the <a href="http://www.aidtransparency.net/">Aid Industry Transparency Initiative</a>, for example – more must be done in times of crisis. Before demanding that west African governments report to their citizens, donors must prove that they too can remove bureaucratic red tape and spend relief aid judiciously and expeditiously. As the president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, has repeatedly pointed out to donors, even before the recent Ebola outbreak, we must “shorten the road from commitment to cash”.</p> <p>In west Africa, we must act now to avoid the problems of past humanitarian relief efforts. Donors should embrace lessons from previous emergencies such as the Asian tsunami, including the need to emphasise local ownership, ensure participatory efforts, make transparency a priority, build capacity to manage funds and handle complaints effectively.</p> <p>One solution would be the immediate establishment of a centralised Ebola relief aid tracking system through which west African governments and donors would provide regular accounts of aid disbursals, in the same way that Ebola cases are <a href="http://ebolainliberia.org/">reported in real time</a>. This should be available in print and online, and managed by local accountability organisations in the affected countries. An existing platform such as <a href="http://aiddata.org/">AidData</a> could be adapted rapidly for this purpose.</p> <p>When Ebola is fully contained – and it will be – donors and west African governments at the centres of the outbreak must also conduct relief aid audits to quell any lingering doubt about the money trail. The government of Liberia has already begun discussions around the idea of a multi-agency special taskforce to monitor corruption within Ebola funding streams, which is a step in the right direction.</p> <p>The people of Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone deserve to know the difference between who pledged to help them and who actually delivered. They deserve to know how much has been spent on expensive consultants or administrative overheads versus practical relief supplies. They deserve to know what amount, if any, has built sustainable national health infrastructure, compensated local medical personnel for their service, and contributed to scientific research to find a cure for Ebola.</p> <p>Most of all, they deserve to know that the response to their suffering is effective, transparent and accountable. This is the very least we owe them.</p> <p><em>Blair Glencorse is founder and executive director of the Accountability Lab, an organisation that empowers citizens to build creative tools for integrity. </em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/26/ebola-food-shortage-fears-liberia <p>Liberia’s government is struggling to secure food supplies as quarantines and border closures aimed at containing the Ebola outbreak disrupt its farmers and pile pressure on food imports.</p> <p>The agricultural sector has been hardest hit by the Ebola crisis, which has crippled domestic food production, said Axel Addy, Liberia’s minister of commerce and industry.</p> <p>Measures to stem the spread of Ebola have increased Liberia’s reliance on food imports, which last year comprised about 80% of all foodstuffs, according to the World Food Programme (WFP).</p> <p>Liberia has brought in food provisions that are expected to last until December, said Addy, but concerns over diminishing food production in the country are mounting.</p> <p>Addy said: “Liberia’s staple [food] is rice, and so prior to coming [to Europe] I spent several weeks negotiating with importers to get an adequate supply of rice into the country. As I left [Liberia] we were actually offloading one vessel and another vessel was ready to offload.”</p> <p>He added: “We will get our rice supply that will take us to November and we have several lined vessels up that will take us through January. On that side we have been able to manage [Ebola’s effect on food supplies], although at a higher cost.”</p> <p>Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4003e.pdf" title="">WFP warned that</a> “disruptions in cross-border trade and marketing activities have resulted in sharp price rises, affecting the food security situation of large numbers of people”.</p> <p>The country’s food security has taken a backseat to measures aimed at containing Ebola, which often require entire villages and communities to be cut off, said WFP spokeswoman Frances Kennedy.</p> <p>Before the Ebola outbreak, Liberia’s food insecurity was deemed “unacceptably high” with 1.2 million people, or 41% of the population, unable to lead a healthy and active lifestyle due to malnutrition, according to<a href="http://home.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/ena/wfp231357.pdf" title=""> a report by Liberia’s ministry of agriculture, the WFP and Unicef</a>.</p> <p>Liberians are scrambling to secure food supplies before quarantines are enforced, according to Kennedy, who returned from the country on 11 September. “Food was a great concern, people were very concerned about how they were going to be able to provide for themselves and their families going forward.”</p> <p>Liberia’s economy has come to a “grinding halt” after Ebola fears led miners to suspend operations and businesses to close their doors. It has slashed its projected growth rate for the mining sector from 4% this year to 2.5% in 2015, Addy said.</p> <p>The cancellation of international flights to Liberia have hurt the country’s economy. “We are being penalised by the stigma of Ebola,” Addy said, bemoaning that only two cross-border flights are still operating.</p> <p>Addy is optimistic that Liberia will be able to secure more food imports, but was worried about Ebola’s impact on the country’s ability to produce food. “Lofa – the county second hardest hit by the epidemic – is our breadbasket and a major source of our food,” he said.</p> <p>The WFP said it would distribute foodstuffs to 405,000 people in each of Liberia’s counties. More than 690 metric tonnes have been distributed so far, while 500 metric tonnes have been held in reserve, the agency said.</p> <p>Liberia needs about 36,000 tonnes of rice to feed its population for one month, according to the WFP.</p> <p>Food distributions efforts are targeting Monrovia’s West Point slum and Dolo’s Town, as well the northern Lofa county, Kennedy said.</p> <p>But the WFP said its ability to feed people trapped in quarantined areas is being hampered by a funding shortfall. Donors have met only 14% of the $126.9m the agency asked for to fund emergency relief programmes.</p> <p>Kennedy said: “This slow response has meant that WFP has had to borrow internal funds to provide urgent logistical support to humanitarian partners. WFP needs funds to meet urgent immediate food needs among quarantined communities and Ebola affected communities. The situation is very fluid in terms of people affected.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/ebola-obama-msf-speeches-not-enough <p>The head of the aid group Médecins sans Frontières has warned Barack Obama and other world leaders that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/obama-un-ebola-virus-spread-outbreak">UN resolutions on the Ebola crisis</a> are worthless unless they are translated into immediate action. </p> <p>Joanne Liu said that there was no end in sight for the epidemic in western Africa, with infection rates doubling rapidly.</p> <p> “Fear and panic have set in, as infection rates double every three weeks. Mounting numbers are dying of other diseases, like malaria, because health systems have collapsed,” she told a United Nations general assembly high-level meeting on Thursday evening. </p> <p>Her warning came as the UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon warned that “despite the valiant efforts of local communities, health systems are buckling under the strain” with more than 200 a day dying.</p> <p>MSF’s latest country-by-country update on the Ebola epidemic shows the outbreak is worsening in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Hopes that it was finally under control in Guinea have been dashed with new cases in districts close to Conarky and Lola near the Ivory Coast. </p> <p>In Liberia, patients numbers are increasing every day with doctors turning away sick people from its two hospitals in Monrovia. </p> <p> “Our 150-bed facility in Monrovia opens for just 30 minutes each morning,” Liu said. Only a few people are admitted - to fill beds made empty by those who died overnight. The sick continue to be turned away, only to return home and spread the virus among loved ones and neighbours,” she added. </p> <p> In Sierra Leone, MSF’s field hospital in Kailahun received 28 patients in one day as a result of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/ebola-sierra-leone-curfew">house-to-house search during curfew</a> at the weekend. It said there was a shortage of ambulances to collect patients, with many travelling for hours in “cramped and deplorable conditions”. As a result, some were dead on arrival. </p> <p> She said just a few states were carrying the load in west Africa and that “complacency is a worse enemy than the virus”.</p> <p> Her speech comes a week after <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/16/obama-to-announce-ebola-force-of-3000-us-military-personnel">Obama promised to send 3,000 military personnel</a> to the region and the UK government promised to build a field hospital in Kerry Town in Sierra Leone with the aid of the British army.</p> <p> But indicating that she still did not think this was enough, Liu pleaded with world leaders not to “cut corners” and told them that “massive direct action is the only way”. </p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-3dce0f30-93cf-4783-b570-126f24337b37"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/26/1411727002294/91b0d68a-42ed-4429-b517-a024f9d50a83-460x292.jpeg" alt="Barack Obama tells the UN general assembly that efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic must be improved." width="460" height="292" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Barack Obama tells the UN general assembly that efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic must be improved.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media/UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>MSF has been calling for a large-scale increase in the world response since July, and its request to the government to allow NHS staff who wanted to volunteer to be released from their work was initially rebuffed. </p> <p>The government officially changed its view in the last week, and so far more than 200 medical workers have volunteered.</p> <p>Liu also called for “a massive effort” to create a vaccine. She said current models of vaccine development would not work. Zmapp, an experimental drug used on several health workers who contracted the virus including <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/03/british-ebola-patient-will-pooley-discharged-hospital">Britain’s Will Pooley</a>, has run out and has yet to be tried on humans. </p> <p>Clinical trials of a second drug have just begun but successful production will not be feasible for many months.</p> <p>Liu said the world needed an “open source” data on vaccine development with collaborative research to expedite the creation of a vaccine. </p> <p>In a separate speech the UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon said the UN should to consider setting up a stand-by corps of medical staff for future heath epidemics.</p> <p> “Just as our troops in blue helmets help keep people safe, a corps in white coats could help keep people healthy,” he said.</p> <p>More than two dozen world leaders, including Guinean president Alpha Condé, participated in the Ebola meeting, held on the margins of the general assembly. Others such as presidents Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia and Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone joined by teleconference.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/danger-response-ebola-red-cross-aid-cuba <p>Simon Jenkins is absolutely right to underline the fundamental difference between humanitarian and political or military intervention (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/19/west-ebola-drop-bombs-iraq-while-drugs-africa" title="">Finally, the west is acting on Ebola. What took us so long?</a>, 19 September). It is also true that humanitarian relief work currently faces unprecedented challenges, often as a result of being seen as linked to one side or another in conflict and other disasters. But it does not follow from this that the humanitarian ethic of the Red Cross has diminished, nor that the impartiality of our founders has been “swamped in the rush to war”. Whether in Syria or Sierra Leone, the Red Cross Red Crescent movement can and does deliver vital assistance every day without political, military or religious influence.</p> <p>We have been responding to the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since its very beginning and now have 2,500 volunteers working to prevent its spread across the three countries. They are part of a worldwide movement which delivers aid on the basis of greatest need. This often involves considerable danger, manifested tragically in Syria (where we are among the few humanitarian agencies able to work across frontlines) in the deaths of 37 Syrian Arab Red Crescent workers while carrying out their work.</p> <p>The biggest threat to our humanitarian mission is being perceived as anything less than neutral, independent and impartial, which can lead to being unable to safely access those in need. This is why in conflict situations we make repeated calls for all parties to ensure quick and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid workers. The decision to provide humanitarian assistance must be driven by need only and regardless of “national security”. For this reason, it is imperative that the concept of humanitarianism is understood correctly.<br /><strong>Mike Adamson</strong><br /><em>Acting chief executive, British Red Cross</em></p> <p>• I’ve seen plenty of coverage of the faltering attempts to combat the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa recently. We’ve all read about the budget cuts at the World Health Organisation that are hampering the response, and the urgent need, articulated by Dr Margaret Chan, the director general of the WHO, for “an army of experts and health workers to combat an outbreak overtaking some of the world’s poorest countries”. Once again, Cuba has stepped forward with 62 volunteer doctors and 103 nurses, all with post-catastrophe experience. Over the past 50 years Cuba has sent more than 300,000 health workers to 158 countries, even offering humanitarian aid to the US – which has tried to bring Cuba to its knees over the past 55 years by its illegal trade blockade – when hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.</p> <p>Simon Jenkins, to his credit, made a passing reference to Cuba’s initiative in his column, but, apart from that, Cuba’s medical volunteers seem to be totally invisible to our media. Isn’t it time we gave them the credit they so definitely deserve?<br /><strong>Ed Glasson</strong><br /><em>Bracknell, Berkshire</em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/obama-un-ebola-virus-spread-outbreak <p>Barack Obama warned the world on Thursday not to “stand back” and expect the United States to combat the spread of the Ebola virus alone, saying a slow international response could cost hundreds of thousands of lives.</p> <p>Speaking at a special high-level meeting on Ebola at the United Nations, Obama said there had been progress in efforts to slow the disease at its epicentre in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. But he added: “We need to be honest with ourselves. We’re not moving fast enough. There’s still a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be.”</p> <p>The international response had to be “like a marathon, but run at the pace of a sprint”.</p> <p>“That’s only possible if every nation and every organization does its part,” the president said. “And everyone has to do more. Right now everybody has the best intentions, but people are not putting in the resources that are necessary.”</p> <p>Obama departed from his prepared text to express frustration at the reluctance of other countries in offering concrete assistance, suggesting that they were taking US intervention for granted.</p> <p>“If we move fast it, could be the difference between 10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 deaths and hundreds of thousands or a million. This is should not about wrangling and waiting to see who will give what first,” Obama said. “Do not stand by thinking somehow, because of what we’ve done, it’s taken care of. It’s not.”</p> <p>The UK has sent 40 humanitarian workers and soldiers to Sierra Leone to help build an emergency medical response centre. Britain’s international development secretary, Justine Greening, said that her country’s contribution would triple the number of beds available for victims of the disease, but she said Sierra Leone still needed urgent help from other countries.</p> <p>In his UN speech, Obama listed the emergency measures taken by his country. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is mounting the largest international response in its history. The advance command post has been established in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, for a contingent of 3,000 US troops to help with medical logistics. The US air force is also setting up an “air bridge” from Senegal to the three most affected countries, to keep up a constant flow of medical worker, equipment and supplies into the region.</p> <p>Obama said the US Department of Health and Human Services is setting up a hospital and field treatment centres across the three most affected countries.</p> <p>At the same meeting, the leaders of the three countries at the centre of the epidemic appealed for more help and criticised international airlines for stopping flights to their capitals.</p> <p>The Liberian president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, said her country was being “ostracised” at a time when it was facing its greatest challenge. Speaking from Monrovia by video link, she said Liberia’s deep tradition of extended families was making it harder to combat the spread of the disease.</p> <p>Families refused to leave the bedside of dying mothers or children, Johnson Sirleaf said, exposing themselves to infection, and could not accept that their sick children should be taken away by strangers, never to be seen again. But she said “We are fighting back,” adding that outreach by public education workers had been identified and foreign assistance had begun to arrive.</p> <p>“Several months down the line, the international community is finally coming around to the better view that the Ebola outbreak is a challenge for everyone,” the Sierra Leonean president, Ernest Bai Koroma, said by videolink from his office in Freetown.</p> <p>“Sierra Leone and its sister republics may be at the frontlines of this fight but we require the heavy aerial and ground support of the world to defeat a disease worse than terrorism.”</p> <p>Justin Forsyth, the head of the Save the Children charity, said at the UN meeting: “There is only a few weeks to act if we are to prevent this crisis spiralling out of control. We need a unified plan and much tighter coordination between all actors to recruit and support frontline health workers.”</p> <p>The Sierra Leonean government has quarantined more than a million people in an attempt to bring an end to the spread of the virus. Areas in the east of the country on the border of Guinea have been under quarantine for months but travel is now restricted in three more areas where an estimated 1.5 million people live. Nearly a third of the country’s population across 14 districts is now under curfew.</p> <p>In an address to the nation, Koroma said the weekend’s lockdown had “met its objectives” but had also exposed the challenges posed by the Ebola crisis.</p> <p>In addition to announcing the new isolation districts, the government is establishing corridors for travel between non-quarantined districts, with a curfew on all travel outside the hours of 9am and 5pm. Koroma said the isolation would “definitely pose great difficulties for our people in these districts”.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/25/norway-liberia-illegal-logging-ebola <p>Norway will give Liberia up to $150m (£92.1m) over the next six years to fund protective measures aimed at stamping out illegal logging in its agricultural sector, which some scientists believe may have contributed to the worst Ebola outbreak in history.</p> <p>The funds will “improve forest governance, strengthen law enforcement, and support efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation”, both governments said.</p> <p>West Africa is gripped by <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/134771/1/roadmapsitrep_24Sept2014_eng.pdf?ua=1" title="">an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus that has claimed the lives of 2,917 people so far</a>, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Scientists have speculated that the crisis could have been driven by illegal logging that unleashed Ebola-infected fruit bats into contact with people, sending the outbreak out of control.</p> <p>“Inhabitants in the region do indeed anecdotally report an exceptionally arid and prolonged dry season, perhaps linked to the extreme deforestation of the area over recent decades. At present, we can only speculate that these drier ecologic conditions somehow influence the number or proportion of Ebola virus–infected bats and/or the frequency of human contact with them,” according to <a href="http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0003056#pntd-0003056-g004" title="">a study co-published in July by Daniel Bausch, associate professor of Tropical Medicine at Tulane University and Lara Schwarz of Canada’s McGill University</a>.</p> <p>On Tuesday <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/23/ebola-cdc-millions-infected-quarantine-africa-epidemic" title="">a new study projected that Ebola could kill up to 1.4 million people</a> by mid-January next year.</p> <p>“Particularly at this difficult time, we are proud and happy to enter into this partnership with Norway, further consolidating our decision to embark on a green, sustainable development path,” said Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.</p> <p>“We have a tunnel vision right now focusing on the Ebola crisis. But Liberia has the largest remaining rainforest in west Africa. This deal helps a lot [to preserve the rainforest],” said Axel Addy, Liberia’s minister of commerce and industry.</p> <p>Liberia’s government says its forests make up 43% of the Upper Guinea forests, which are a vital source of the earth’s carbon.</p> <p>“This partnership holds promise not only for the forest and climate; but for forest communities that have been marginalised for generations. The partnership’s commitment to respecting and protecting communities rights with respect to forests is laudable,” said Silas Siakor, a Liberian environmental activist.</p> <p>The deal will see both sides “contribute to sustainable development in Liberia through protecting natural forests, restoring degraded lands, and developing Liberia’s agricultural sector through enhancing sustainable agricultural management, and greening supply chains,” according to <a href="http://www.regjeringen.no/pages/38817741/LetterofintentLiberia.pdf" title="">a letter of intent signed by both countries</a>.</p> <p>Residents and experts worry that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/27/ebola-epidemic-business-impact-africa" title="">the Ebola crisis could wreak havoc</a> on West African economies, as quarantines prevent people from working.</p> <p>But Patrick Alley, director of Global Witness, said efforts to preserve Liberia’s forests could reap huge economic rewards.</p> <p>“For decades Liberia’s forests have been more of a curse than a blessing. Timber revenues funded Charles Taylor’s regime during Liberia’s brutal civil war. Since then the experiment to generate economic development through industrial scale logging has failed, with logging companies routinely logging illegally, skirting taxes, and causing huge damage to forests and forest communities,” Alley said.</p> <p>“If Liberia delivers on this promise it could help spur the country’s economy and set development on a sustainable path at such a difficult time,” he added.</p> <p>The negotiations on the partnership we launched today have been ongoing since long before the Ebola crisis,” said Jens Frølich Holte, a political adviser to the Norwegian ministry of climate and environment. “Of course, dealing with the [Ebola] crisis has to be the top priority.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/sep/25/fun-theory-gamification-development <p>When presented with the choice of escalator or stairs, most of us chose to queue up for the escalator, even though walking up the stairs is better for our health. But what would you do if the staircase was a giant piano? A “fun theory” experiment <a href="http://www.thefuntheory.com/piano-staircase">tried exactly that</a> and found that 66% more commuters opted for the stairs over the escalators, proving that fun can be a motivating factor for improving health.</p> <p>Changing people’s behaviour for the better is part of what public health aims to achieve. Several health projects are already incorporating fun theory. For example, Unilever is using cartoon characters to<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jun/23/handwashing-life-saving-sanitation-development"> get children to wash their hands</a> and to stop the spread of preventable diseases. And in India, the Aids Fighter Pilot and Stop TB Cricket mobile phone games were designed to raise awareness of HIV/Aids and tuberculosis among young people. The games were appreciated by the target group and <a href="http://confabjournals.com/confabjournals/images/1912014328371.pdf">were found</a> to be an effective, quick and convenient medium for improving health.</p> <p>It makes sense to incorporate fun theory into programmes aimed at children and young people, but can the approach persuade adults to adopt healthy habits too? Theatre performances, role plays and songs have helped raise awareness on health issues for years. Currently, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5vBEETGeQs#t=64%29">#StopEbola song</a>, which originated in Ivory Coast, has gone viral. And a game called <a href="http://www.engagementgamelab.org/games/bodaboda/">Boda-Boda</a> was devised by the <a href="http://www.redcrossug.org/">Uganda Red Cross</a> and <a href="http://www.engagementgamelab.org/">the Engagement Lab</a> to bring down motorcycle taxi accidents. During the game, players compete to earn fares by safely moving passengers from one station to the next. When the inevitable crashes happen, players can help each other by giving first aid.</p> <p>And it’s not just behaviour change that’s using fun to improve health. In 2011, tens of thousands of online gamers were co-opted to help work out the 3D structures of proteins as part of work to discover the cure for HIV using a game called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axN0xdhznhY">Foldit</a>. They discovered the structure of a retrovirus enzyme, <a href="http://www.washington.edu/news/2011/09/19/gamers-succeed-where-scientists-fail/">a task which scientists had failed for more than 10 years to complete</a>.</p> <p>Gamification is not the only way to encourage behaviour change in health, but it can be a tool for raising awareness on serious issues and helping societies overcome epidemics. Gamification also has potential to help people with chronic diseases to manage their medical regimes.</p> <p>But there are downsides. Game mechanics are based on extrinsic motivators and can detract from people’s intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic rewards can be a powerful tool to start new behaviours, but too much reliance <a href="http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/intrinsic-and-extrinsic-motivation-in-education-definition-examples.html#lesson">can actually decrease self-motivation over time</a>. Another downside is that the process of gamification is entirely top down. The designers of the game create the rules and the framework and let no space for improvement or innovation from the users.</p> <p>A New York City based non-profit <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/">Games for Change</a> has devised a <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/learn/let-the-games-begin-a-toolkit-for-making-a-game-for-change/">toolkit</a> for helping NGOs to create “social impact games”. This a good resource for development organisations who want to make their programmes a bit more fun.</p> <p><em>Marie-Christine Boeve is head of communications at the </em><a href="http://www.btcctb.org/"><em>Belgian Development Agency</em></a><em>.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/ebola-sierra-leone-curfew <p>Door-to-door searches during a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/19/sierra-leone-three-day-shutdown-ebola-outbreak">three-day curfew in Sierra Leone</a> identified more than 350 suspected new cases of Ebola, according by the top US diplomat in the country. </p> <p>Charge d’affairs Kathleen Fitzgibbon said teams of volunteers had also discovered 265 corpses, of which 216 have since been been buried, in an email to organisers of the curfew that has been seen by the Guardian. </p> <p>Fitzgibbon said the home visits had identified a preliminary 358 new suspected cases, with 85 patients sent to treatment centres.</p> <p> Although there had been some “challenges” during the curfew, which saw the normally chaotic streets of the capital Freetown replaced by eerie silence after the government ordered everyone to stay in doors, it could be seen as the “beginning of the end” of the Ebola epidemic, which has killed more than 2,800 people, primarily in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</p> <p> “The challenges included the late arrival of some materials, a rumor that the soap was infected with Ebola. Some people fled to the bush to avoid the house-to-house [checks] but came back for the last day,” she said, adding that there had also been a “slow response to pick up corpses”.</p> <p>American public health institute the Centers for Disease Control has been heavily involved in the emergency response in Sierra Leone and is running the laboratory in Kenema, Sierra Leone’s third biggest city. </p> <p>“Our team decided the three-day stay-at-home was a ‘watershed moment’ whose momentum must be turned into specific activities to ensure that we can reach our goal of isolating 70% of positive cases to reverse the upward trend of the epidemic,” Fitzgibbon said. <br /></p> <p>“The public needs to understand that this campaign did not end Ebola but can be the beginning of the end if everyone remains vigilant,” she added. </p> <p>The email said one of the priorities was to ensure all bodies were buried correctly as funerals have been identified as one of the ways the disease has spread, with relatives touching the bodies of the deceased. </p> <p>She said she was “extremely saddened” to hear of two incidents of the disease spreading recently, one in the area of Moyamba in which 24 people had died “as a result of participating in this funeral” and another in Kenema, in which 17 infections were traced to a funeral.</p> <p>Fitzgibbon described one man in Kenema government hospital as a “hero”. He survived the disease and stayed in the hospital helping other patients, “in particular a young child whose parents are dead”, because he knew he was immune to contracting the virus again. </p> <p>“We need to celebrate this man’s contribution ... survivors should not be stigmatised, but instead celebrated,” she said.</p> <p>In Makeni, a large town three hours from Freetown, an Irish nun helping at a holding centre said 138 suspected cases had been identified with 19 bodies buried and 39 patients send five hours away for treatment. </p> <p>“The good thing is we have had some survivors. One man and four women came back and they addressed the emergency people. It seemed to give them back the energy, because they are all exhausted,” said Sr Mary Sweeney.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-89d8203f-1629-423b-8e35-e080e6b202aa"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/24/1411563800606/b23e8d32-b384-4deb-b8d1-a425ee2b8242-460x276.jpeg" alt="Near-empty streets during a three-day curfew in Freetown." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Near-empty streets during a three-day curfew in Freetown.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Michael Duff/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Full email<br /></h2> <blockquote> <p>From Charge d’Affaires Kathleen FitzGibbon</p> <p> September 23, 2014</p> <p> The House-to-House campaign met its objectives, thanks to public participation. Preliminary information indicates that the teams were able to reach between75% to 85% of the 1.7 million households throughout the country. Here are some of the lessons learned. Interpersonal communication is the most effective way to deliver messages. Most misconceptions were dispelled by the teams. Neighborhood watches will continue helping communities connect with service providers. It will be important to sustain the holding and treatment facilities as those who were ill self-reported or were identified by neighbors. The public needs to understand that this campaign did not end Ebola but can be the beginning of the end if everyone remains vigilant. </p> <p> Sierra Leoneans voluntarily went to holding or treatment centers. A preliminary number is that 358 suspected cases were transferred to holding centers for testing, with 85 transferred to treatment centers. There were 285 bodies found during the exercise and 216 of those have been buried. Corpses are swabbed and tested to determine cause of death. We still await the official data as the districts are still reporting results so these numbers are not final. Public acceptance of the campaign was high. It is important to get all cases of Ebola into care centers.</p> <p> The challenges included late arrival of some materials, a rumor that the soap was infected with Ebola, some people fled to the bush to avoid the House-to-House but came back for the last day, and improved but still slow response to pick up corpses. Another constraint was that some of the holding centers were opened late. For sure, small businesses and poor residents faced more challenges than most, but independent monitors report that many of them stated that campaign was important enough to participate.</p> <p> Today, our CDC team shared with President Koroma what our team has been doing and will continue to do in support of the response. In Dr. Frieden’s words, we are with Sierra Leone through the entire epidemic. Our team described this three-day stay-at-home as a “watershed moment” whose momentum must be turned into specific activities to ensure that we can reach our goal of isolating 70% of positive cases to reverse the upward trend of the epidemic. CDC is running the laboratory at Kenema, assisting the Ministry of Health and Sanitation with data management, supporting the Emergency Operations Center at the national and local levels, and will be doing more to strengthen the district health teams. This is where the fight will be won. The data is important to allow us to target where the new infections are coming from. CDC also recommends that all bodies are buried in a medically safe manner. This is what we are aiming for and you can be assured that all the donors are working closely with the government to support the burial teams. We are supporting the International Federation of the Red Cross to train and manage burial teams in several districts. We also are funding treatment centers.</p> <p> I was extremely saddened to here of two recent instances, one in Moyamba and a second in Kailahun, where prominent persons died and the communities conducted burials. In Moyamba, 24 persons are dead as a result of participating in this funeral and there may be others. In Kailahun, the same scenario, with some 17 deaths traced to this funeral. Please, save yourselves and your community, let the Ministry of Health and Sanitation conduct all burials. We know that these teams are overwhelmed, but be persistent in insisting that corpses are handled only by trained personnel.</p> <p> Let’s end on a high note and talk about a hero. There is a man in the Kenema Government Hospital treatment center who has recovering from Ebola. He is now immune. He stayed in the treatment center helping with other patients, in particular, a young child whose parents are dead. He could have left, but he chose instead to remain and help this child, who is unrelated to him. We need to celebrate this man’s contribution to the fight against Ebola. Survivors should not be stigmatized, but instead celebrated and enabled to be an important component of the response. Bravo<br /></p> </blockquote>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/21/sierra-leone-freetown-lockdown-ebola-continues <p>Sierra Leone's unprecedented move to sequester its entire population indoors for three days to get to grips with its Ebola epidemic may be extended into this week because volunteers have been unable to visit everyone, officials said on Sunday.</p><p>The country's 6 million people were ordered to stay at home from Friday morning so that health workers could educate households about Ebola, which has killed more than 500 people in Sierra Leone and another 2,000 across other west African countries.</p><p>The lockdown has been unpopular and locals have complained of food shortages and serious economic consequences. But on Sunday night, a senior official told Reuters that the exercise might not be over yet.</p><p>"There is a very strong possibility it will be extended," Stephen Gaojia, head of the Emergency Operations Centre, which leads the national Ebola response, told Reuters after meeting President Ernest Bai Koroma. "Even though the exercise has been a huge success so far, it has not been concluded in some metropolitan cities like Freetown and Kenema," he said.</p><p>Gaojia said 92 bodies had been recovered across the country by the end of Saturday, the second day of the lockdown, and 123 people had contacted the authorities, believing they might be infected. Of these, 56 had tested positive for Ebola, 31 tested negative and 36 were awaiting their results.</p><p>The streets of Freetown, the capital, were again mostly deserted on Sunday. Sierra Leone's government was hoping the lockdown, the most aggressive containment effort yet attempted, would turn the tide against the disease.</p><p>In Bonga Town, a shantytown community near the national stadium in Freetown, some residents were upset that handouts of rice were distributed only to some families, said Samuel Turay, a 21-year-old volunteer.</p><p>The community often serves as a way station for rural Sierra Leoneans trying to move to the capital, and many homes are makeshift and dilapidated, with heavy rocks holding down zinc roofs to stop them blowing away with the wind.</p><p>"They expected, when they saw us, that we were coming with food, but unfortunately we are just coming to talk to them. So they were not so happy about it," Turay said.</p><p>Miatta Rogers, a mother living in the west of Freetown, said the city's poorer residents generally used the money they earned each day to buy food, making planning for a three-day lockdown impossible.</p><p>"Things are not going smooth right now. Everyone is not happy," she said. "When the government makes a ruling like this, then we all just have to abide by it, but it is not very easy."</p><p>The World Food Programme provided food packages including rice, beans and porridge throughout the lockdown, although they were not going door to door and were instead focused on serving houses placed under quarantine by medical teams, spokesman Alexis Masciarelli said on Sunday.</p><p>The agency distributed two weeks' worth of rations to 20,000 households in slum communities just before the lockdown, he said.</p><p>Turay said some residents of Bonga Town, and similar communities said the provisions they received were insufficient.</p><p>"People were saying that, if people are going to lock down for three days, you cannot just leave them like that without food, you have to provide food for them," he said.</p><p>Kabarie Fofanah, another volunteer, said some families were refusing food out of fear that it was poisoned. Turay and Fofanah both encountered Freetown residents who feared the soap being distributed by outreach teams was poisoned and potentially lethal.</p><p>"Yesterday, there was this lady shouting, saying we want to kill her, she is not interested in the soap, we should keep moving," Fofanah said. "We tried our level best to talk to her but she refused to take the soap. She is afraid."</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/21/ebola-makes-you-a-risk-to-yourself-sierra-leone <p>Hospital waiting rooms are miserable places at the best of times, but in the middle of an Ebola outbreak Freetown's Princess Christian Maternal Hospital is suffocating. Corridors that would normally bustle with children and harried parents are sepulchral. Nurses whisper in forlorn huddles in empty rooms. Then a shriek of joy shatters the silence. "Jessica! You're back from America!", a tiny elderly woman cries, rushing towards me with open arms. Before I have time to react, she throws her arms around me in a vice-like embrace.</p><p>What would ordinarily be brushed off as a case of mistaken identity takes me 21 days – the incubation time of the Ebola virus – to get over.</p><p>In a country where more than 500 have died after six months of Ebola – which is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids – the "no touching" rule has become the norm. At the beginning of my 10-day trip to Sierra Leone, I went to shake a friend's hand. He threw himself back against the wall with a panic that would have been comical if not for the fear on his face. Such reactions soon became as routine as having my temperature taken at road checkpoints and washing my hands in buckets of chlorinated water found everywhere.</p><p>I had only one more lapse. On my third day I was at the Médecins Sans Frontières treatment centre with my sister Katie, a documentary film-maker who was accompanying me, when I reached out to tuck a wisp of her hair that had come loose. The act was so natural, I didn't even think about it. Suddenly a medic yelled across the field hospital: "No touching!"</p><p>The paranoia that seized me then didn't leave until I returned home. Unlike other hostile situations I've covered over five years in west Africa – riots, wars and natural disasters – in this case people I cared about were the enemy. Ebola makes you a risk even to yourself: touching your eyes, nose or mouth can infect you. Now a stranger in a hospital was hugging me.</p><p>"I'm so happy you came, Jessica. My daughter gave birth!", this wizened woman declared, beaming up at me. "Come and see," she said. At some point, as Mariatu marched me past deserted rooms – "so is your husband back in America now?" she asked, to which I replied, "He's in Nigeria, where we live"– she must have realised I was neither Jessica nor from America. Even then, she kept going. When she handed me the newborn swaddled in a pink blanket, I understood why. In a country where births can prompt neighbourhood festivities, only me, Mariatu and her daughter were there to celebrate. Everyone else she knew was too scared of catching Ebola to come to the hospital.</p><p>To me, this incident defines what it is like living through an Ebola epidemic. It is both underwhelming and terrifying. It turned out the most exhausting part was my own paranoia. Some, like Mariatu, have defeated their paranoia. Logically, I knew the risk of contagion was low and I understood how to protect myself. But throughout my time in Sierra Leone I was plunged into a state of hyper-awareness about my own body and that of every person around me. One health worker who had identified dozens of cases told me many patients had reddened eyes in the early stages. Suddenly I noticed an awful lot of people in Sierra Leone seemed to have bloodshot eyes.</p><p>The World Health Organisation has warned that huge resources need to be poured into Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, which account for all but a handful of the 2,500 deaths, in order to keep them from spiralling into the tens of thousands by the year's end.</p><p>To travel to Kailahun, where lush forest sprawls across the interior regions of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, is to understand how Ebola exploded here, and how it was swept under the carpet for so long. I spent every childhood summer at my paternal grandfather's house in rural Nigeria, yet the remoteness of the affected villages shocked me. Roads burrowed tunnels through vegetation that looked as if it had paused for breath before engulfing us all again.</p><p>"Around here you don't know if you're in Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone. You'd never say 'I'm going to Guinea'; you'd just say 'I'm going to the next village'," said Nickson, our cheerful driver, explaining why the disease has cast such a wide net over the three countries' porous interior regions. Nickson wore a surgical mask most of the time – "I don't want to die, I have a son," he kept saying – brought his own tinned food from Freetown and whipped out a bottle of chlorinated spray whenever someone touched the car.</p><p>I watched a team of young Sierra Leonean burial volunteers in anti-contamination suits descend in this environment of straw-topped huts, towering forests and mud-lined streams. It was surreal, almost frightening.</p><p>But for all that traditional practices and suspicion of outsiders has fuelled the outbreak – last week villagers in the remote Guinean village of Womey killed eight members of an education team – what lies at the heart of many people's denial and inability to adapt is an all-too-common fear of illness and death. One doctor seconded to the country told me he had dealt with similar reactions when diagnosing patients in the US with HIV.</p><p>I was surprised to discover how hard it is to change your behaviour, even when your life is at risk. In every village we visited, several people would bound up to the car before I'd even got out and lean cheerfully against the window. Sweat and spit would sometimes fly in – you notice this when you're hyper-aware. But always, as with the hospital situation with Mariatu in the hospital, I didn't want to be rude and turn away from them.</p><p>Habits go much deeper than that, of course. Most experts believe many unrecorded Ebola outbreaks may have died out naturally as locals adapted at their own pace. For example, by the tail-end of the 2000 outbreak in northern Uganda, the Acholi turned to long-trusted measures for <em>two gemo </em>–roughly translating into "an illness borne by evil winds" – which had been applied during flareups of other infectious diseases, like measles and smallpox, medical anthropologist Barry Hewlett discovered. Alongside spirit-chasing rituals, infected people were treated in homes where sticks of elephant grass signalled that only previous survivors could enter.</p><p>Such measures can't solve an outbreak of this magnitude, which has jumped to urban areas, too. The help of western nations is desperately needed, but for me the great tragedy of this outbreak has been the revelation of just how abjectly west African governments have failed to invest in their own citizens' healthcare, education and infrastructure – all of which might have nipped the epidemic in the bud.</p><p>Only four ambulances serve Kailahun, a district of nearly half a million people. Entire families sometimes cram into one car to accompany Ebola-sick relatives to the centre, so those who weren't ill before become infected. Unsurprisingly, that feeds a cycle of mistrust.</p><p>Dozens continue to die in conditions that are  unimaginable in the west. The only reason things aren't even worse is down to the incredible efforts of international medical charities, who can't safely expand without more experts on the ground.</p><p>One afternoon a group of women at the MSF centre dragged themselves to a small outside area fenced off with orange plastic mesh. It was impossible to guess their ages – they had been hollowed out by illness, and could barely acknowledge anything beyond their pain. One woman turned to glance at me with what was clearly enormous effort. I understood I was witnessing physical agony too private to be shared.</p><p>"It's sad in there. We see people who have diarrhoea, who have vomited on themselves; sometimes they fall on the ground and cannot move," said Moussa Kefa, a volunteer hygienist who was getting ready to enter the isolation tent. "Sometimes we see 10 people die in one day. It's a hard job, but we're doing it for our people."</p><p>The morning after the nine-hour ride back to Freetown, Cheikh, who had driven me back, called to say he wasn't feeling very well. He had a headache, he couldn't eat and – his voice wavered slightly – he had a temperature. All the classic symptoms of Ebola. I told him to head to the nearest clinic for a check-up.</p><p>My voice was calm but when I hung up, my hands were shaking. I couldn't disentangle my panic from what was real. I was acutely aware of every twinge or ache in my body.</p><p>Was I feeling this hot before I spoke to him, or was it the onset of fever? Had my neck really been so sore from sleeping badly last night or was it muscle aches?</p><p>I turned out to be okay, as did Cheikh. But each time I hear of fresh Ebola deaths, I picture those women sitting in a tent in the tropical heat, too weak to raise their heads.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/19/west-ebola-drop-bombs-iraq-while-drugs-africa <p>The language is familiar. “A potential threat of a human catastrophe <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/nationworld/ci_26547510/ebola-prompts-u-s-troops-dire-warnings-human" title="">unparalleled in modern times</a>.” More than 2,500 have died, and the same number are dying. Incidence of the disease is said to be doubling, even trebling, in some parts of Africa by the month. Hundreds of thousands now face death. Barack <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2014/sep/17/ebola-outbreak-barack-obama-video" title="">Obama declares</a> a menace “spiralling out of control, getting worse … with profound economic, political and security implications for all of us”. The window of opportunity to contain the outbreak is apparently closing.</p> <p>Africa is now six months into the worst <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/07/guardian-view-on-ebola-epidemic-world-health-organisation" title="">Ebola epidemic</a> in modern history. The director general of the World Health Organisation, Margaret Chan, calls the outbreak “the largest, most complex and most severe we’ve ever seen”. The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/04/ebola-six-nine-months-control-who-margaret-chan" title="">UN remarks</a> that we could “stop the Ebola outbreak in west Africa in six to nine months, but only if a massive global response is implemented”. As it is, the number of new cases is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them. According to Chan, “there is not one single bed available for the treatment of an Ebola patient in the entire country of Liberia”.</p> <p>The language of crisis is banal. Threat, disaster and catastrophe lie flat on the page. The nouns may be awesome, but are let down by qualifiers: “could”, “may face”, “potential”. We see lines of Africans waiting helplessly to die, but we have seen many of those over the years. The suspicion is always of hyperbole, what Americans call agency log-rolling. When Obama speaks of Ebola having “profound security implications” I eyed my nearest defence lobbyist.</p> <p>The true measure of how seriously the world takes a “crisis” is not the description but the response. This Ebola outbreak began last December. America is now slowly coming forward, with 17 treatment centres, and “training 500 medical staff”. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-29174923" title="">Cuba is sending 165 helpers</a>. China is sending 60. Britain is “planning a clinic”. Nurses are flying to help, former patients giving blood and volunteers queuing in Oxford for vaccine trials.</p> <p>The lumbering dinosaur of the drugs industry has at least been galvanised into life. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/17/ruth-atkins-first-british-volunteer-injected-trial-ebola-vaccine-oxford" title="">GlaxoSmithKline is producing 10,000 doses of vaccine</a> in case tests show it can work. True, as with the experimental cure <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/29/ebola-breakthrough-zmapp-drug" title="">ZMapp</a>, the vaccines will go to medical workers. But the regulators have found they can process the paperwork “in just four working days”, when it takes months, even years, to process other life-saving drugs. We might ask: why the difference?</p> <p>This belated activity hardly measures up to the words quoted in my first paragraph. <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/" title="">Ebola was first isolated in 1976</a>. Central Africa has experienced increasing outbreaks since the mid-1990s. Yet this spring there were still no drugs available and no sign of the millions of dollars required in associated aid. The best Washington’s federal drug administration could do, under the cosh of the pharmaceutical firms, was <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-issues-warning-on-fake-ebola-drugs/" title="">warn Africans against fake medicines</a>. Pushing untested “experimental” ones was unethical, it said. Drug companies had enough trouble before when accused of testing drugs on developing countries. Whatever the crisis, there must be no bad karma for big pharma.</p> <p>Contrast this hesitant humanitarian intervention with the hysteria driving the next military intervention by the west in Iraq. This needed no talk of catastrophe and disaster, no trumpets and drums from the media. Events in Syria and Iraq were monstrous, inhuman, cruel and – as we British say – unacceptable. So a “threat to national security” is declared and, bang, in go the air strikes. Anyone who protests is a wimp. America is putting <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/another-western-war-spread-terror-isis-us-crisis" title="">1,600 troops back on Iraqi soil “as advisers”</a>. Iraq is said already to be flooded with special forces. Another Baghdad government has been toppled and a new one is lauded as a saviour.</p> <p>Every military pundit now warns against doing in Iraq precisely what Islamic State (Isis) wants, which is offer it a powerful Christian enemy to rally jihadists to its flag. General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in Washington, is deaf to such warnings. He says he will be deploying ground troops in rescue missions and even “attacks against specific <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/17/6259923/isis-isil-the-islamic-state-daesh-what-is-isis-why-does-obama-use-isil" title="">Isil</a> targets”. The Pentagon was planning to widen “the types of targets it hits from the air, focusing on Islamic State leaders”. That was, said Dempsey, a “first step”. And the step after that? The idea of military escalation seems to electrify democratic politicians the world over. David Cameron dives to his bunker. Tabloids scream for revenge. Everyone congas to the deadly dance of mission creep.</p> <p>It must be ever more likely that a fundamentalist enclave in western Iraq will survive for a while. As with the Taliban’s rule in Kabul, we helped create it and will have to live with it. After the most appalling slaughter, much of it at our hands, we find another part of the world resolutely refusing to behave as we ordered. We bomb and kill, and it is as bad as it was before, probably worse.</p> <p>That said, the most encouraging news this week was that al-Qaida in Syria had pleaded with Isis not to kill aid workers, since they were trying to save Muslim lives. This was some antidote to one of the <a href="http://www.chathamhouse.org/node/15213" title="">gloomiest talks I have heard</a> recently, given at Chatham House by Yves Daccord, director general of the international Red Cross. Never, he said, had humanitarian relief work been so compromised as now through being seen as a proxy for one side or another in a civil conflict.</p> <p>Frequently, as in Syria, the Red Cross was seen as on the side of the ruling regime; elsewhere it was seen as on the side of rebels. Everywhere its image was tarnished by association with foreign, especially western, military intervention. The humanitarian ethic of the Red Cross and the early UN had become corrupted by militarism. Local commanders, said Daccord, demand that the UN and its local agents, “prove to me that you are really independent and impartial, that your service is relevant”.</p> <p>Relating the relief of suffering to “national security” – as Obama does, even in the case of Ebola – is madness. A casualty of the “anti-terror” wars of the past 15 years has been the confusion of humanitarian with politico/military intervention. It not only undermines the ideological purity of aid but also endangers aid workers. The impartiality of the founders of the Red Cross and the UN has been swamped in the rush to war. Humanity loses out to killing.</p> <p>We have dithered for six months over Ebola in Africa, yet in Iraq chase once more that will-o’-the wisp of political machismo: the perfect bomb strike.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/18/ebola-health-workers-missing-guinea <p>The prime minister of Guinea said that seven bodies had been found after a team of health workers went missing during a push to raise awareness of the outbreak of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/ebola" title="">Ebola</a> which started in the country nine months ago.</p><p>Witnesses said the team were set upon by angry residents in the remote village of Womey, where many remain in denial about the disease, or suspicious of foreign health workers. Several failed to return following the visit on Tuesday. Officials earlier said some – including three journalists and the director and two senior doctors of the main local hospital – were being held captive. Atempts to reach them stalled when angry residents destroyed bridges leading to the village.</p><p>"The meeting started off well; the traditional chiefs welcomed the delegation with 10 kola nuts as a traditional greeting," said a resident who was present at the meeting  and gave only his first name, Yves. "It was afterwards that some youths came out and started stoning them. They dragged some of them away, and damaged their vehicles."</p><p>In an announcement made on state television late on Thursday, Mohamed Saïd Fofana said authorities had located the bodies a day after the group was abducted. Among the dead were three Guinean radio journalists who had been covering the education efforts.</p><p>A government spokesman, Damantang Albert Camara. told Reuters: "The bodies were found in the village latrine. Three of them had their throats slit." Some others from the delegation are still believed to be missing.</p><p>The Ebola outbreak across five west African countries has spiralled into the world's biggest ever epidemic, with more than 700 cases – out of 5,300 overall – emerging in the past week alone, the World Health Organisation said on Thursday.</p><p>The WHO said there was a desperate shortage of health workers and supplies in an epidemic likely to last many more months. Health workers across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where most of the cases are, have been periodically attacked by citizens in a region experiencing the deadly virus for the first time.</p><p>The district of Nzérékoré, where the team disappeared, exploded in clashes after health workers tried to spray the local market last month. About 50 people were arrested and two dozen police officers who were sent to quell the riots were injured.</p><p>In Sierra Leone, almost 30,000 volunteers will go house-to-house to raise awareness of the disease <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/17/ebola-three-day-shutdown-sierra-leone" title="">during a three-day "lockdown", when residents have been asked to remain at home</a>. Thousands of soldiers are to enforce the curfew, due to start at midnight on Thursday.</p><p>A sluggish international response to the crisis has picked up in recent days. The US will send 3,000 troops to Liberia to help provide desperately-needed boots on the ground in the country hardest hit by the outbreak.</p><p>France's president, François Hollande, said the former colonial power would set up a military hospital to help tackle the disease in Guinea.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/17/william-pooley-ebola-flight-us-blood-transfusion <p>The British nurse who survived Ebola has travelled to the US to help save another victim, it has been reported.</p><p>William Pooley has been taken to Atlanta for an emergency blood transfusion which could save the life of a doctor who contracted the virus while working in Sierra Leone.</p><p>Pooley, 29, the first Briton to contract the virus, took a flight to the US on 12 September, according to London's Evening Standard. As a survivor, his blood contains antibodies against Ebola and doctors said those could be passed on via a transfusion.</p><p>Pooley, who has said he intends to return to Sierra Leone to help victims, was granted an emergency passport to travel to the US, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).</p><p>A spokesman said: "Following a request from his family, the FCO consular team and the UK Passport Office worked together to get a replacement passport to Will Pooley within 24 hours. This enabled him to fly out to the US immediately and potentially assist with the treatment of an Ebola victim."</p><p>The American aid worker was airlifted back from Sierra Leone after contracting Ebola. Dr Aneesh Mehta, an infectious diseases specialist who is treating the aid worker at the special isolation unit at Emory University hospital, said: "We believe the supportive care – allowing the body to heal itself and supporting it through that process – is the mainstay of therapy, as is true for any infectious disease," he said. "If we have therapeutic options, we'll evaluate those."</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/17/ebola-three-day-shutdown-sierra-leone <p>Residents across Sierra Leone, one of three countries at the centre of the biggest ever Ebola outbreak, scrambled on Wednesday to prepare for a three-day, unprecedented nationwide "lockdown" in a radical step intended to curb the spread of the killer virus, but which some health experts believe could worsen the epidemic.</p><p>Citizens will not be allowed to leave their homes from Thursday until Sunday. Known as "ose to ose" in the widely-used local Krio, health workers will also go house-to-house identifying cases and raising awareness. More than 2,300 have died across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the nine-month epidemic that the World Bank warned this week could lead to deaths in the "tens of thousands" if unchecked by the end of the year.</p><p>Some 21,000 people have been recruited to enforce the lockdown, bulking up thousands of police and soldiers already deployed to quarantine districts in the worst-hit regions near the border with Guinea. But some international health experts have advised against the move, citing both practical concerns and disastrous attempts at the mass quarantine of the biggest slum in neighbouring Liberia.</p><p>Isolating communities has succeeded in some rural areas in past outbreaks in Central Africa. But last month, West Point, a sprawling neighbourhood in Liberia's capital Monrovia, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/aug/22/ebola-liberia-monrovia-crisis-citizenship" title="">exploded in days of riots</a> that led to at least one death after the army poured in, showing the challenges of trying to quell a disease that has never before reached urban areas.</p><p>"What you don't want to do is actions that make the population lose more trust in you," said David Heymann, who was part of the team that first identified the virus near the Democratic Republic of Congo's Ebola river in 1976. "Trying to cordon off an area isn't rational unless you can enforce it 100 percent. It's not dealing with the problem the way we know how to do it."</p><p>Such extreme reactions seemed unlikely in Freetown. "I've accepted this if it will mean a light at the end of the tunnel," said Linda Barrie, who has given over her entire roadside stall of household goods for bleach and hand sanitiser – both of which help kill the virus. "I haven't seen any sign of Ebola here except that people don't come to buy anymore. So the government should do whatever it is so this suffering can end."</p><p>It's a different story in rural areas, where fear and misunderstandings have caused the outbreak to spiral out of control.</p><p>Vandy Cawray, the head of Kailahun's Ebola social mobilisation team, has a story he uses to encourage reluctant residents to talk to him. When he and his team tour the forest-clad interior, he explains how he once met two youths with telltale red eyes. "The men refused to admit they had been in contact with Ebola victims, but Cawray alerted contact-tracing teams anyway. When they were taken to a treatment centre, one survived.</p><p>"I tell them, look, that man was lucky; unless you yourself come forward, you might never have a chance for survival," he said. It's a story Cawray expects to tell many times over the next three days.</p><p>MSF, the medical charity leading the fight, said it had "concerns" about the proposed lockdown. "We support the idea of increasing awareness about Ebola but we're extremely concerned about the capacity," said Christina Falconi, country coordinator for Sierra Leone. "I'm standing in Kailahun right now and I can see all the wards we have here. Every single one is full. We're turning people away, so I can say that as of today there will not be enough beds for any new cases," she said, speaking from the 80-bed treatment centre in Kailahun.</p><p>President Ernest Bai Koroma is expected to give a speech before the lockdown's midnight start on Thursday; the government expects to identify up to 20% more cases. Those with suspected Ebola will be taken to "holding centres".</p><p>"It will be extremely difficult for health workers to accurately identify cases through door-to-door screening as this requires a certain level of expertise. But critically, even when potential patients are identified, there will not be enough Ebola management centres to care for them," MSF said in a press release. "It has been our experience that lockdowns and quarantines do not help control Ebola as they end up driving people underground and jeopardising the trust between people and health providers. This leads to the concealment of potential cases and ends up spreading the disease further."</p>

And that’s more incentive for people to stay home where at least they’re with their family,” he said. </p> <p>Brantly said at least 200 and as many as 300 doctors, nurses, hygienists and other staff members are needed to treat 100 patients.</p> <p>Many west Africans stay at home after they’re stricken with the disease, Brantly said. For this reason, he told the panel, the US should beef up its home health care initiative, adding to the thousands of home health care kits Obama pledged to send to the afflicted region. Part of this strategy should include community outreach with trust traditional and community leaders as well as educating home health-caregivers on best practices for treating the ill at home.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2014-09-17T18:31:49.832+01:00">at 1.31pm ET</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-5419b81be4b0afd22399547e" class="block"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2014-09-17T17:52:06.190+01:00">12.52pm <span class="timezone">ET</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Dr Chinua Akukwe,an Africa analyst with expertise in HIV/AIDS, said the global response to the Ebola outbreak provides an opportunity to re-build and improve Africa’s ill-equipped healthcare system.

Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly, who contracted the disease working for the a missionary group in Liberia, is scheduled to testify before the committee. Brantly recovered from the disease after being treated with Zmapp, an experimental antiviral drug.<br /><br />On Tuesday, the White House pledged to send 3,000 troops​ as well as medicine and equipment to help​ combat the Ebola epidemic raging across Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Speaking from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, President Obama urged international leaders to ramp up the response to the outbreak, which he called “a potential threat to global security”.<br /><br />“If the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected with profound political, economic and security implications for all of us,”​ Obama said.<br /><br />The United Nations​ said on​ Tuesday ​that nearly $1bn (£620m) is needed to combat the disease, which ​it said ​could grow almost exponentially​ by the year’s end. ​​The UN warned that Ebola, for which there is no known cure, could infect up to 20,000 people by the end of the year if unchecked.<br /><br />Since the rampage began, the virus has ​killed nearly half of the 4,985 ​people who have ​confirmed, probable or suspected cases​​b of the disease​, according to the World Health Organization. The WHO has described the outbreak as “unparalleled in modern times”.</p> <p>We’ll kick things off at 10am ET, when the hearing gets under way.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2014-09-17T15:52:42.515+01:00">at 10.52am ET</time></p>  </div>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/17/ruth-atkins-first-british-volunteer-injected-trial-ebola-vaccine-oxford <p>A woman in Oxford has become the first British volunteer to be injected with an experimental Ebola vaccine, which, if it works, will be fast-tracked for use in west Africa.</p><p>In an unprecedented move, the untested vaccine has already gone into mass production. Some 10,000 doses are being manufactured by the British drug company GlaxoSmithKline, funded by the Wellcome Trust and the UK government, which are also supporting the Oxford trial.</p><p>If the vaccine is effective, there will be supplies available to protect thousands of health workers in west Africa, who will be the first to receive it. Nobody wants a repeat of the ZMapp experience – only a dozen doses were available worldwide of the experimental drug and, controversially, they went mostly to foreign medical and aid workers.</p><p>The first British volunteer is Ruth Atkins, 48, a communications and engagement manager in the NHS from Marcham in Oxfordshire and a former nurse. She heard on the radio as she was driving home from work that volunteers were needed for a vaccine trial run by Oxford University researchers.</p><p>"I volunteered because the situation in west Africa is so tragic and I thought being part of this vaccination process was something small I could do to hopefully make a huge impact," she said.</p><p>One hour after the vaccination, she said: "I feel absolutely fine, it felt no different to being vaccinated before going on holiday."</p><p>Atkins is the first of 60 healthy people who will be vaccinated to find out whether the potential vaccine has any troublesome side effects. Studies involving animals have shown no ill effects so far.</p><p>The vaccine was under development by GSK – it was in the portfolio of Okairos, a smaller company bought by GSK last year – before the Ebola outbreak occurred, but it could have taken a decade to get it through the trials and into production.</p><p>There is a growing sense of urgency, with the World Bank warning on Wednesday that billions of dollars could be drained from economies in west Africa by the end of next year if the epidemic is not contained. The bank has pledged about $200m in emergency assistance to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three countries worst affected. The US announced on Tuesday it would send 3,000 troops to help tackle the outbreak.</p><p>Four trials of the vaccine will take simultaneously to gather enough safety data and early information on the immune response, which is an indication of whether it will protect against the disease.</p><p>Ten volunteers have already been injected in the US, where the National Institutes of Health has been funding the development of the vaccine against the Ebola Zaire strain and another against Ebola Sudan. If all goes well, there will also be trials in the Gambia and Mali in healthy volunteers.</p><p>It is hoped results from the trials will be available before the end of this year. If the vaccine is effective, it will be given to health workers in Ebola-stricken regions. This will be the only way to find out whether the it really can protect against the disease.</p><p>Prof Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, which is running the trial, said: "Witnessing the events in Africa makes it clear that developing new drugs and vaccines against Ebola should now be an urgent priority. It is tremendous that so many people have worked hard to make this trial happen in a short time, and I am enormously grateful to those volunteers who have come forward to take part and to the funders including the Wellcome Trust, DfID, MRC and MHRA for supporting this trial so quickly.</p><p>"These are initial safety trials of the vaccine and it will be some time before we know whether the vaccine could protect people against Ebola. But we are optimistic that the candidate vaccine may prove useful against the disease in the future."</p><p>Dr Ian Hudson, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency's chief executive, said the trial proposal was approved with extraordinary speed: "Our priority is to protect public health. Given the importance of Ebola as a risk to public health in some countries in Africa, we fast-tracked the review of the clinical trial application for this vaccine so that it was assessed and authorised by the MHRA's experts in just four working days."</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/17/7m-ebola-contribution-not-enough-australian-medical-association <p>Australia’s contribution to fighting the Ebola virus is still inadequate despite the promise of another $7m, the head of the Australian Medical Association has warned.<br /></p> <p>Brian Owler said <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/10/ebola-australia-must-provide-more-support-to-tackle-crisis-ama-says?CMP=soc_568">last week</a> that the government’s commitment of $1m to the World Health Organisation to control the outbreak in west Africa was inadequate, and on Wednesday the government pledged an extra $7m.</p> <p>WHO and Médecins Sans Frontières will each receive $2.5m, while $2m will be given to Britain to help combat the disease in Sierra Leone, the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said.</p> <p>But Owler said the extra $7m was still not enough compared with support being offered by the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/16/obama-to-announce-ebola-force-of-3000-us-military-personnel">US</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/12/ebola-outbreak-avoidable-tragedy-uk-ministers-mps">UK</a>.</p> <p>While he welcomed the extra funding, Owler said Australia urgently needed to coordinate the deployment of volunteer doctors and other health professionals to west Africa, and provide protective and medical equipment and supplies, transport and accommodation.</p> <p>“The Ebola outbreak is at epidemic proportions, and growing at an alarming rate,” he said in a statement. “Australia must step up its efforts as part of the international response to provide care and save lives in west Africa, and stop the deadly Ebola virus from spreading to other parts of the world, including Australia.” </p> <p>There are 4,985 confirmed cases of Ebola infection in the

its military personnel</a> to the affected areas, train health workers, and supply medical and logistical support in the form of healthcare facilities and beds.</p> <p>“The UK is coordinating the

/></p> <p>The WHO has estimated up to 20,000 could be infected by the end of the year if the haemorrhagic virus is not contained. </p> <p>Dr Grant Hill-Cawthorne, a researcher with the Marie Bashir institute for infectious diseases and biosecurity at the University of Sydney, said Australia had an obligation to help curb the crisis.</p> <p>Eight million did not sound like a lot of money to commit to the Ebola response, he said.</p> <p>“Sending medical staff would be a good way for our doctors to get experience in these situations and treat the disease just in case it comes to Australia,” he said. “Though Australia faces a very low risk even if it does come here as we are very prepared and have a strong health system, as we saw with the <a

was small.</p> <p>The risk to areas outside west Africa comes from spread via infected travellers, however, “Australia is well prepared for such a possibility”, the piece said.<br /></p> <p>“While Ebola virus is a scary proposition, with good infection control and vigilant health authorities, outbreaks will not occur in this country.”<br /></p> <p>The federal Department of Health had provided extensive guidance on recognising and treating the diseases, and state departments had issued risk assessment guidelines and management plans.<br /></p> <p>But associate professor Sanjaya Senanayake,<em> <br /></em>a practising infectious diseases physician at the Australian National University medical school, said it was clear the international community was struggling to get on top of the outbreak overseas.</p> <p>“So now the US is asking the international community to step up, especially France and Britain who have colonial links with the major countries involved,” he said.</p> <p>“The biggest and best way to reduce the threat to us is to control it in west Africa. I think the longer the outbreak goes on, the more the risk increases of it entering Australia.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/16/ebola-outbreak-us-to-send-3000-troops-west-africa <p>President Barack Obama called the Ebola epidemic in west Africa a potential threat to global security as the White House pledged to send 3,000 troops to fight the worst ever outbreak of the disease in history.</p><p>"If the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected with profound political, economic and security implications for all of us," Obama said, speaking at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</p><p>While in Atlanta, Obama met with healthcare professionals from Emory University, where two American aid workers infected with the deadly disease were successfully treated and released last month after being given doses of an experimental drug. Another American infected with Ebola is receiving treatment at Emory while a fourth is receiving treatment at a Nebraska hospital.</p><p>Almost $1bn (£620m) is needed to contain the Ebola epidemic raging across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, which could infect up to 20,000 people if unchecked by the end of the year, the UN  warned, as the US pledged to send troops to help contain the world's biggest ever outbreak.</p><p>"If not dealt with effectively now, Ebola could become a major humanitarian crisis in countries currently affected," Valerie Amos, the UN humanitarian chief,  told reporters in Geneva. The capacity of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to provide even the most basic necessities was, she warned, "on the brink of collapse".</p><p>The stark warning was echoed by other health bodies at an emergency meeting in Geneva on Tuesday, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) emergency chief, Bruce Aylward, saying the outbreak was "unparalleled in modern times".</p><p>"We don't know where the numbers are going," he said. He said two weeks ago that when the WHO said it needed the capacity to manage 20,000 cases "that seemed like a lot. That does not seem like a lot today."</p><p>The US said it would send 3,000 troops to help tackle the Ebola epidemic.</p><p>A regional centre run by the US army in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, where the outbreak is spiralling out of control fastest, will coordinate efforts to build more than a dozen treatment centres and train thousands of healthcare workers.</p><p>More than 2,400 people have died from the virus, for which there is no approved cure in this outbreak. A few cases have been recorded in Nigeria and Sierra Leone. All 26 previously recorded outbreaks have been successfully contained largely by isolating patients but the WHO said cases would continue to rise for at least sixmore months in an epidemic that has jumped borders and erupted in urban areas.</p><p>WHO said about $987.8m was needed for everything from paying health workers and buying supplies to tracing people who had been exposed to the virus, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids such as blood, urine or diarrhoea.</p><p>Foreign medical teams with up to 600 experts, as well as at least 10,000 local health workers, are needed to stem the outbreak, the global health body has said.</p><p>About $23.8m is needed to pay burial teams and buy body bags, since the bodies of Ebola victims remain highly infectious and workers must wear protection suits.</p><p>The cost of the US's latest effort will come from $500m allocated for overseas contingency operations, such as the war in Afghanistan, which will instead be reallocated to west Africa and Iraq.</p><p>"This humanitarian intervention should serve as a firewall against a global security crisis that has the potential to reach American soil," US senator Chris Coons told the Associated Press.</p><p>The Obama administration has also requested an additional $88m from Congress to fight Ebola, including $58m to speed production of the ZMapp experimental antiviral drug and two potential Ebola vaccines. The US classifies Ebola as a bio-terrorist weapon.</p><p>Troops will take about two weeks to be deployed, with Barack Obama expected to give further details after a visit to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Tuesday.</p><p>Liberia has borne the brunt of the epidemic, recording 1,224 deaths as of 6 September.</p><p>Médecins Sans Frontières, the medical charity leading the fight against Ebola, has repeatedly said the international community's response has been "lethally inadequate,". amid a shortage of everything from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/04/ebola-kailahun-sierra-leone-burial-boys-west-africa" title="">burial teams</a>  to surgical gloves.</p><p>"We are honestly at a loss as to how a single, private [non-governmental organisation] is providing the bulk of isolation units and beds," MSF president Joanne Liu said in a speech to the UN in Geneva.</p><p>"Highly infectious people are forced to return home, only to infect others and continue the spread of this deadly virus. All for a lack of international response," she said.</p><p>She called on countries with biological-disaster response capacity, including civilian and military medical capacity, to dispatch specialist medical units to west Africa.</p><p>Ruggero Giuliano, MSF medical coordinator in Liberia, said plans were under way to double capacity at the organisation's 200-bed facility before ramping up to 1,000 beds. "There are many days where we need to close the [centre's] gates and leave patients outside. The problem isn't building facilities – it's staffing them. You need experts to run the place, people need to be highly trained."</p><p>So far, Cuba and China have said they will send medical staff to Sierra Leone. Cuba will deploy 165 people in October while China is sending a mobile laboratory to speed up testing for the disease. Health workers in Kenama, in Sierra Leone's badly-affected eastern region, said they were using plastic bags amid a shortage of basics such as rubber gloves.</p><p>The outbreak has rippled beyond the health sector, prompting spending cuts across the board as all three countries struggle with rising inflation and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/27/ebola-epidemic-business-impact-africa" title="">drops in productivity</a>. Liberia and Sierra Leone's fragile postwar economies will shrink by 3.5% this year, the IMF said, meaning less money is likely to go into vital infrastructure and education projects.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/15/ebola-doctor-death-olivet-buck-sierra-leone <p>My brother-in-law, Albert, is a GP based in the West Midlands. His sister Olivet Buck was a doctor too: though her work was quite different. She practised in the land of their birth, Sierra Leone. For the past few months she was fighting in the desperate battle against Ebola ravaging parts of her country. Last Tuesday came the awful news that she’d caught the virus.</p> <p>To save her life, local campaigners called for her to be evacuated to Germany to receive treatment – all three previous doctors who had caught the disease in the country had died. Sierra Leone’s president backed her, saying that a hospital in Hamburg was “in readiness to receive her”. Last Friday, though, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/14/ebola-outbreak-fourth-doctor-dies-sierra-leone" title="">the World Health Organisation said it would not allow her to leave Sierra Leone</a>, and refused to fund the move. Desperate attempts were made to try to overturn this decision but on Sunday came the news everyone was dreading: Olivet had died.</p> <p>Albert, distraught, told me: “I shall never stop weeping at all our loss. Olivet was a truly remarkable person. She died because she would not forsake her service to others.”</p> <p>But the death of Olivet, a 59-year-old mother of three, raises wider questions about how the world responds to the Ebola crisis, and how it protects those working closest to stop its spread.</p> <p>Despite the fate of the previous doctors, the WHO had said merely that it would work to give Buck “the best care possible” in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>However, foreign health and aid workers have been sent abroad from Sierra Leone and Liberia for treatment – including the British nurse <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/09/william-pooley-ebola-sierra-leone-outbreak-epidemic" title="">William Pooley, who survived and now wishes to go back to Sierra Leone</a> to continue helping to fight the disease. Only last Friday, <a href="http://www.amsterdamherald.com/index.php/rss/1247-20140912-dutch-doctors-exposed-ebola-patients-flown-home-sierra-leone-netherlands-health" title="">two Dutch doctors were flown home after coming into contact with infected patients</a>.</p> <p>But so far no local health workers have been evacuated: even though, according to the WHO, in west Africa <a href="http://www.onenewsnow.com/ap/world/sierra-leone-requests-funds-for-ebola-evacuation#.VBcAgPb6qYE" title="">301 have so far caught Ebola and 144 have died</a>. Dr Sheik Humarr Khan, Sierra Leone’s top Ebola doctor, was being considered for evacuation to a European country when he died of the disease in late July.</p> <p>Albert is convinced that, despite Olivet being diagnosed only last week, her life could still have been saved. “The Hamburg hospital was ready to take her on Thursday; and when I spoke to her on Friday, even though she was weak she was still in good spirits.”</p> <p>And he says of the WHO’s decision: “I think it showed a callous lack of compassion for a devoted frontline clinician, especially since there is now awareness of equipped units elsewhere to which other patients have been evacuated and successfully treated.” The combination of specialist equipment, drugs and a clean healthcare environment can have rapid results, he points out. Olivet was, in contrast, working in an overcrowded unit with poor sanitary conditions – in a part of the capital, Freetown, that has become densely populated since refugees fled the country’s civil war in the 1990s. “The best care possible” is a meaningless phrase in this context.</p> <p>The WHO decision seems to be making a distinction between western health workers in the region who are, rightly, given live-saving treatment – and those from the countries concerned who are taking equal risks, are equally courageous and are equally important in the struggle, but condemned to take their chances in a poorly funded healthcare system that can barely cope.</p> <p>And the decision was hugely counterproductive too, because if Ebola is to be tackled, everything must be done to encourage those in the frontline to continue their work despite the huge risks they face.</p> <p>According to Liberia’s president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the disease could overwhelm the country and “threatens civil order”. <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201409151392.html" title="">In a letter to President Obama, Johnson-Sirleaf said</a>: “Diseases that were treated with relative ease pre-Ebola now take lives because of the pall that Ebola has cast over our health system.”</p> <p>Without the work of those like Dr Buck the disease could rapidly rage out of control, threatening not only the region but the wider world too.</p> <p>Nearly 5,000 people have now contracted Ebola, half of whom have died. And the rate of infection is increasing. Just days ago the WHO director general, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-surging-beyond-control-who-s-margaret-chan-warns-1.2764285" title="">Margaret Chan, warned that “the number of new patients is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them</a>”, and called for urgent international support in the form of doctors, nurses and medical supplies to the worst-affected countries.</p> <p>Denying potentially life-saving treatment to those on the frontline can only work against this international effort. Albert feels very angry about his sister’s treatment. “Those involved in this decision need to be held to account,” he says.</p> <p>Health workers from a wide range of countries are working alongside each other to fight Ebola. How can it be right to give some the chance of life when they contract the disease, and condemn others to death?</p> <p>And though it’s too late to save Olivet, Albert now wants a change of WHO policy so that her fellow health workers know they’ll be fully supported if they’re unfortunate enough to contract the virus. That way, he feels, her death need not have been in vain.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/15/as-ebola-closes-schools-in-africa-how-do-we-help-children-learn <p>In response to the growing threat of Ebola across west Africa, the governments of Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have closed their schools. The closures are only temporary, but that could change if the spread of the virus continues and accelerates.</p> <p>As of 12 September, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are facing widespread and intense transmission of Ebola (about 100 to 200 new cases per country per week). In other affected countries, the outbreak has been more localised. But in each affected areas the threat could expand rapidly, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/09/09/oxford-study-predicts-15-more-countries-are-at-risk-of-ebola-exposure/">there are credible predictions</a> that Ebola could migrate to 15 additional countries and <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/ebola">infect more than 20,000 people</a>.</p> <p>With that prognosis, closing schools is an understandable and prudent step to protect children and their families from exposure. The most immediate priority is to put out a raging and growing fire that threatens to affect more lives and territory. </p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-305e47ff-75ef-4de1-be53-0be02a57024a"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/15/1410738319705/bfa43566-fdad-4949-a7aa-58c41022fff8-460x276.jpeg" alt="Children play at the Restoration Baptist church in Monrovia." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Children play at the Restoration Baptist church in Monrovia.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Dominique Faget/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The closure plays a dual role in a child’s life. It’s a measure to keep them safer and more days out of school, all wrapped up into one. </p> <p>Many of the Ebola impacted nations were already struggling to provide education for children who had missed years of schooling because of poverty or civil war. The problem of lost time will be compounded: the health crisis is putting on hold teacher training, school constructions, curriculum reviews and the delivery of textbooks – to name just a few issues raised by the crisis.</p> <p>As Ebola robs children of schooling, the seeds are also being sown for ongoing problems in public heath: the more educated people are, the more likely they are to keep themselves, their families and communities safe. In affected countries, fear and misunderstanding about Ebola is intense and widespread, complicating the efforts of health workers to contain the disease. In some cases, people suspected of being ill with the virus, including medical practitioners caring for the sick, face discrimination because of a lack of knowledge about the disease.</p> <p>The scenarios playing out in these African nations are all too familiar to the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) and our many partners in the education sector. It is one of our priorities to help countries plagued by conflict or natural disaster to maintain continuous schooling for their children. When full continuity is impossible, our aim will be to facilitate children getting education in some other way than through school attendance. In all these contexts, GPE’s role is to keep all the essential players – the NGOs, government ministries, humanitarian responders and education specialists from donor countries and multilateral institutions – working together.</p> <p>In Liberia, where schools will remain closed at least until 1 October, our education partners are currently collaborating closely. They have drawn up an emergency response plan that equips teachers, schools and districts to help raise public awareness about the virus. Plans are being put in place to help children to live with the trauma associated with the outbreak. Should schools remain closed for an indefinite period of time, education leaders are considering a national education radio program for home-based learning.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-cd0f12b5-b505-4a37-9a70-64dab2707006"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/15/1410739012513/a39c0b4a-015c-41a2-97f1-7af7002a71b0-460x276.jpeg" alt="Children sit outside their homes in a favella in Liberia." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Children sit outside their homes in a favella in Liberia.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tragically, the emergency will almost certainly slow, and possibly stop, the remarkable progress Liberia has made over the past decade when it comes to education. In 2010, the Global Partnership approved a US$40m education grant to further this progress and strengthen the management capacity and accountability in the education sector and to improve education in rural areas. While that grant is not at risk, it is dispiriting to see Liberia progress of recent years will stall. In Sierra Leone, schools have not opened since 9 September, and authorities are suggesting they may remain closed for three months or more. As in Liberia, contingency measures are being put in place to compensate for the loss of learning opportunities.<br /></p> <p>As we have learned from many nations in crisis, it is essential that education planners remain vigilant and flexible. Vigilant, to ensure that children are not kept away for too long from their learning, and flexible so they can adapt quickly and effectively to the unexpected. The stakes for anything less are much too high –the time for considered action is now.</p> <p><em>Julia Gillard is chair of the Global Partnership for Education</em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/14/ebola-decades-humanitarian-work-never-seen-such-suffering <p>I wake up each morning – if I have managed to sleep – wondering if this is really happening, or if it is a horror movie. In decades of humanitarian work I have never witnessed such relentless suffering of fellow human beings or felt so completely paralysed and utterly overwhelmed at our inability to provide anything but the most basic, and sometimes less than adequate, care.</p><p>I am supervising the suspect tent, which has room for 25 patients who are likely to have <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/ebola" title="">Ebola </a>– 80-90% of those we test have the virus. We administer treatment for malaria, start patients on antibiotics, paracetamol, multivitamins, rehydration supplements, food, water and juice while they wait for their results. Sometimes people have arrived too late and die shortly after arriving.</p><p>In one afternoon last week I watched five seemingly fit, healthy, young men die. I gave the first a bottle of oral rehydration solution and came back with another for the second. In the half a minute or so in which I had been away the first man died, his bottle of water spilt across the floor. The four others followed in quick succession.</p><p>We sometimes have to hold back tears but try to offer patients all the comfort that we can – especially if they are in their last moments. I cannot spend as much time as I would like with each of them due to the intense heat of the personal protective equipment and the sheer number of patients.</p><p>My colleagues in logistics are doing a fantastic job of building new extensions and hopefully, in the next week, we will increase our capacity further still. In the meantime, we are only open to admit patients for a couple of hours each day before all our beds are full again. Once admitted, patients spend 10-14 days with us, and if their body beats the virus – and they have three days in which they do not show symptoms – we perform another test to see if they have fully recovered. &nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, people die before they even reach our centre. It is a difficult and dangerous procedure to remove a body from a vehicle and the team often has to do this many times a day. We have been forced to order an incinerator from Europe because the local crematorium cannot cope with the number of bodies.</p><p>Each day this week patients have recovered – in the early stages there were no survivors whatsoever. Yesterday seven people went home, including a young man who had painted the inside of one of our tents red when he arrived because he was bleeding so profusely. Our team had thought he had no hope of survival. It is lovely to see the patients going home with their certificate of discharge, though most have lost family members or friends, and can face stigma upon their return.</p><p>I believe MSF is doing a fantastic job, but we are only able to care for a minority of the people in Monrovia who have Ebola. We also work in the north of the country, but every county is now reporting cases and we have absolutely no capacity to respond.</p><p>It is extremely sad to see the indifference of the international community with regards to this epidemic. It is great to see an added interest and investment in research for vaccines, but we urgently need experts who are physically present and more structures on the ground here in west Africa, where the situation continues to be catastrophic.</p><p></p><p><em>The author is an aid worker for </em><a href="http://www.msf.org.uk/" title=""><em>Médecins Sans Frontières </em></a><em>who wished to remain anonymous</em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/13/liberia-president-asks-us-help-ebola <p>Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has begged the US for help in tackling Ebola, as American scientists warned that official forecasts on the development of the outbreak might be far too conservative.</p><p>The disease might not be contained for 18 months and could infect hundreds of thousands of people, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/world/africa/us-scientists-see-long-fight-against-ebola.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0" title="">epidemiologists mapping its spread for the US told the <em>New York Times</em></a>.</p><p>The World Health Organisation has forecast that Ebola could be contained in six to nine months after infecting around 20,000 people. But the American scientists warned that at the rate the disease is currently spreading, that many people could potentially be infected in a single month.</p><p>Dr Jeffrey L Shaman, associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Heath, was part of the project that forecast the outbreak would be contained in 12 to 18 months.</p><p>Ebola has infected more than 4,000 people in West Africa. Monrovia, Liberia's crowded capital, has been badly hit. A slum was quarantined last month, leading to food shortages and riots, and a teenager was killed when police opened fire on the crowds, but the blockade seemed to have little impact on the spread of Ebola.</p><p>Liberia is still recovering fromthe impact of a civil war that lasted over a decade and only ended in 2003. Without help in tackling the spread of Ebola, the country could slip back into chaos, Sirleaf warned in a letter to Barack Obama.</p><p>"I am being honest with you when I say that at this rate, we will never break the transmission chain and the virus will overwhelm us," the <em>New York Times</em> quoted her saying.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2014/sep/12/time-to-support-science-mr-obama <p>If anyone had the notion that the 21<sup>st</sup> century would bring peace and prosperity to most of the world, a mere glance at the newspaper shatters that illusion on a daily basis. Horrific wars and conflicts, downed civilian aircrafts, beheadings and executions and the brutal kidnapping of hundreds of young girls dominate the news. Western democracies must make concerted attempts to intervene and prevent such terror. This is easier said than done, as many such attempts have ended with poor results leading to a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” philosophy.</p> <p>However, in addition to man-made dangers lurking around the globe, infectious diseases remain rampant in the less developed world. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta (US), the outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa has infected a suspected number of over 3000 cases with more than <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/guinea/">1500 suspected deaths</a>.</p> <p>Although I hope that treatments will be discovered that will help the African patients, it is with pride that I have read that two US physicians who were infected while courageously manning the front lines of this war on disease in Africa appear to be <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/american-ebola-patient-hopes-for-discharge-soon-1408126329">doing well in US hospitals</a>. A third US physician, also infected, was admitted several days ago to my own medical center <a href="http://www.livewellnebraska.com/health/american-doctor-with-ebola-virus-arrives-at-nebraska-medical-center/article_94326f90-34e2-11e4-95df-0017a43b2370.html">hospital here in Omaha, Nebraska</a>, and news reports suggest that <a href="http://www.kcci.com/news/update-on-how-omaha-ebola-patient-is-doing/28015574">he may be improving</a>.</p> <p>There is no vaccine available for Ebola, and there are apparently very limited amounts of the experimental drug that was <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/05/us-doctor-infected-with-ebola-arrives-in-nebraska/15119223/">reportedly used</a> for the other two US physicians. In any case, the Ebola outbreak coupled with the lack of vaccines and ability to treat the masses of infected patients with drugs highlights the concern that scientific and biomedical research is not being sufficiently supported.</p> <p>In the US, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – which is the primary source of funding for biomedical researchers – has a budget of just over 30 billion dollars. For those of us in research, this eventually translates into a ~5-10% chance of having a grant proposal funded. This means that a reviewer who is given a stack of ten of these grants to review, knows that statistically, 0 to 1 of the 10 grants will be funded. It’s not hard to see why scientists are feeling the pinch.</p> <p>But even for those who are fortunate enough to be funded through the NIH, in real terms, science budgets have been declining for many years. The average yearly budget of an NIH grant has not increased in the 11 years that I’ve run my own lab. Factoring in cost-of-living expenses for personnel salaries, student stipends, and the inflation and increasing cost of reagents, the actual buying power of today’s budget compared to the same budget ten years ago has decreased dramatically. Just this week, my lab asked for a quotation for Foetal Bovine Serum, a staple for growing cells in culture to do experiments. In a typical year we purchase 10–15 bottles of 500 ml all at once (from the same batch and lot number to ensure consistency in our studies). Last year, the bottles cost $93 each. This year the cost has increased to $195. It’s not difficult to envision the negative impact that this has on the science.</p> <p>I therefore make an impassioned plea to Mr Obama and other world leaders: do not neglect science. Support basic research in all of the sciences. Support biomedical research. Do so now, so that just as smallpox, polio and diptheria have been nearly eliminated from the list of threatening diseases, Ebola, HIV, malaria and other parasitic diseases may join the ranks of unemployed pathogens.</p> <p><em>Steve Caplan is a biomedical researcher with a lab working on endocytic protein trafficking.

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/12/ebola-outbreak-avoidable-tragedy-uk-ministers-mps <p>The Ebola epidemic that has so far killed more than 2,200 people in west Africa was an “avoidable tragedy” that underlines the vital need for Britain and other international donors to spend more on strengthening health systems in developing countries, an influential group of UK MPs has warned.</p> <p>In a <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmintdev/246/24602.htm">blunt report published on Friday,</a> the international development committee urged Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID) to place greater emphasis on building up weak health systems and to draw on the medical and managerial expertise of the NHS in doing so.</p> <p>“The devastating ongoing Ebola epidemic in west Africa has served to emphasise the importance of establishing strong health systems,” it said. “The apparent hesitancy and lack of coordination in the international response suggest that the global health system and emergency plans have failed.”</p> <p><a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee/">While the committee</a> described DfID as a “world leader” in strengthening health systems, it said it feared the department’s “target-driven mentality”. It added that work with large international partnerships whose focus is on getting rapid results by concentrating on specific, high-profile diseases had come at the expense of shoring up health infrastructures in poorer countries.</p> <p>According to the report, DfID spent £360m on supporting health systems and £10m on health systems research in 2013-14. Over the same period, it provided £387m to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi); £543m to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and £53m to Unitaid, the international organisation created to increase the supply of affordable medicines to the developing world.</p> <p>“DfID has a good record on health but relies on international partners such as the Global Fund and the vaccine alliance to spend an ever greater proportion of the UK aid budget,” said the committee’s chairman, Sir Malcolm Bruce. “To date, these organisations have successfully delivered significant ‘quick wins’ by targeting Aids, malaria and TB.”</p> <p>Bruce said the department needed to review its funding arrangements to ensure that aid money was being used to build stronger health systems, adding: “It must also be prepared to withhold funds from organisations unwilling to take this approach.”</p> <p>The committee recommended that DfID become a “more vocal champion of health system strengthening on the world stage”. This could be achieved by publishing more figures about its spending and performance – and by encouraging others to follow suit, it said.</p> <p>Another of the report’s key suggestions was that the department make proper use of the skills and knowledge on its own doorstep. “For all the domestic criticism it gets, the NHS is internationally recognised as one of the best health systems in the world,” said Bruce. “Yet DfID only makes modest use of the considerable expertise that resides within the NHS.”</p> <p>The committee said the NHS had much to offer in both human and institutional expertise. Not only would encouraging more UK medical staff to volunteer overseas help share knowledge and skills, it would also benefit the NHS by building global contacts. Similarly, argued the committee, NHS administrative staff could offer advice on finance and management while also learning “to tackle familiar problems in unfamiliar settings”.</p> <p>Bruce said lessons had to be learnt from the Ebola epidemic, which has spread to Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.</p> <p>It was, he said, “an avoidable tragedy that has served as a devastating reminder for what happens when health systems are weak”.</p> <p>A DfID spokesperson said: “DfID is a world leader in supporting developing countries to strengthen their health systems, improving facilities, management, staffing and access to supplies. The Ebola crisis demonstrates the vital importance of a fully functioning health system and the UK will continue to help affected countries to respond to the outbreak.</p> <p>“More than £25m of British funding is supporting the global effort to contain Ebola, which also includes providing medical supplies, funding vaccine trials. In addition, British military and humanitarian experts will set up a medical treatment facility in Sierra Leone.”</p> <p>International health agencies have been accused of responding far too slowly to Ebola. A month ago, Joanne Liu, international president of the medical charity Médecins sans Frontières, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/15/ebola-outbreak-vastly-underestimated-world-health-organisation">criticised the World Health Organisation for not declaring the outbreak an international public health emergency until 8 August</a>, adding: “I think the wake-up call was too late.”</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it would spend $50m (£31m) to support the emergency response to the outbreak.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/11/scientist-identified-ebola-quasi-military-intervention-peter-piot <p>The microbiologist who helped identify the Ebola virus in 1976 has urged David Cameron to support a "quasi-military intervention" to stop the current epidemic, which is spreading unchecked in west Africa.</p><p>Professor Peter Piot, the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the outbreak was now so bad that a UN peacekeeping force ought to be mobilised in Sierra Leone and Liberia with huge donations of beds, ambulances and trucks as well as an army of clinicians, doctors and nurses.</p><p>"At the moment, I'm not so optimistic, I'm pessimistic about how to control it. It's one thing to isolate patients or put a small village or town in quarantine; it's another thing when entire countries are affected," he said. "This requires a state of emergency and a kind of quasi-military intervention – and it's not my style to&nbsp;exaggerate."</p><p>Piot, who has worked for the UN and World Health Organisation, said the US and UK efforts were good, but not good enough. "It's all going far too slow; I think there's still no sense that this is an absolute emergency and catastrophe," he said.</p><p>Describing the "formidable management challenge" that lies ahead, he said the biggest question for him was what would happen if the disease spread to "megacities" in Nigeria, where there have already been seven deaths from 19 confirmed cases.</p><p>"One of the reasons for this being out of control is because of the slow response both from the national community and the international community, with the exception of Medecins sans Frontières (MSF)," he added.</p><p>Piot said the Ebola outbreak was discussed at a meeting of the government's Cobra national emergencies committee last month, so he knew Cameron had been briefed on the problem.</p><p>He said: "I call on the government and the prime minister to intensify the country's efforts and provide assistance, and to accelerate it also."</p><p>He said Cameron should sanction the release of up to 100 NHS doctors and nurses to go to Sierra Leone and Liberia and called on the UN to put an international emergency programme into action. "There is no way that the three countries effected most can handle this on their own," he said.</p><p>In an interview with the Guardian, Piot also called on British Airways and other airlines including Air France to resume flying to the two countries, saying the closure of services this summer "has not been helpful" to the aid effort.</p><p>He said security could be guaranteed if passengers were screened before boarding.</p><p>A Belgian, now based in London, he co-discovered the virus in Zaire 38 years ago but never thought he would see an outbreak of this scale. It has already affected four countries and has claimed about 2,300 lives, more than the combined total of all previous outbreaks.</p><p>Piot, who is working hard behind the scenes to provoke a sense of urgency at government levels, said the head of the UN's peacekeeping operations in Liberia had already offered to assist, but that the force needed training.</p><p>"I was in contact with them and they said: 'We are not trained for that, we do not know how to do this.'"</p><p>The African Union has also offered to get involved on a military level, but again needs outside help from experts in infectious disease containment.</p><p>"This is an enormously complicated logistics job. Frankly, the military, together with DHL and so on, and companies who do transport and delivery, they would be extremely useful," Piot added.</p><p>He urged the UN High Commission for Refugees to get involved and other agencies who deal with disasters including the International Rescue Fund, chaired by David Miliband. "I think they should get involved, absolutely," he said. "They are the ones with most experience to organise and mobilise on a large scale in a minimum of time, [as well as] the military.</p><p>"I think the NHS and universities can help. We should make it possible for nurses and doctors who wanted to do this and want to work in an organised way, like through MSF, to go."</p><p>A team of up to 100 would have huge impact, he said, and would not compromise the NHS.</p><p>"This should be the last epidemic of Ebola where all we have is quarantine and isolation," Piot said. "What we need the next time are stockpiles of drugs or treatments or vaccines in countries where undoubtedly the virus will resurface."</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/11/ebola-treatment-centre-liberia <p>Soon after arriving in Monrovia, I realised that my colleagues were overwhelmed by the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/08/ebola-liberia-thousands-new-cases-in-weeks-who" title="">scale of the Ebola outbreak</a>. Our treatment centre – the biggest <a href="http://www.msf.org/" title="">Médecins Sans Frontières</a> has ever run – was full, and Stefan, our field coordinator, was standing at the gate turning people away. This wasn’t a job that we had planned for anyone to do, but somebody had to do it – and so I put myself forward.</p> <p>For the first three days I stood there, it rained hard. People were drenched, but they carried on waiting because they had nowhere else to go.</p> <p>The first person I had to turn away was a father who had brought his sick daughter in the trunk of his car. He was an educated man, and he pleaded with me to take his teenage daughter, saying that while he knew we couldn’t save her life, at least we could save the rest of his family from her. At that point I had to go behind one of the tents to cry. I wasn’t ashamed of my tears but I knew I had to stay strong for my colleagues – if we all started crying, we’d be in trouble.</p> <p>Other families just pulled up in cars, let the sick person out and then drove off, abandoning them.</p> <p>One mother tried to leave her baby on a chair, hoping that if she did, we would have no choice but to care for the child.</p> <p>I had to turn away one couple who arrived with their young daughter. Two hours later the girl died in front of our gate, where she remained until the body removal team took her away. We regularly had ambulances turning up with suspected Ebola patients from other health facilities, but there was nothing we could do. We couldn’t send them anywhere else – everywhere was, and still is, full.</p> <p>Once I entered the high-risk zone, I understood why we couldn’t admit any more patients. Everyone was completely overwhelmed. There are processes and procedures in an Ebola treatment centre to keep everyone safe, and if people don’t have time to follow them, they can start making mistakes.</p> <p>It can take 15 minutes to dress fully in the personal protective equipment and, once inside, you can only stay for an hour before you are exhausted and covered in sweat. You can’t overstay or it starts getting dangerous. The patients are also really unwell, and it is a lot of work to keep the tents clean of human excrement, blood and vomit, and to remove the dead bodies.</p> <p>There was no way of letting more patients in without putting everyone, and all of our work, at risk.</p> <p>But explaining this to people who were pleading for their loved ones to be admitted, and assuring them that we were expanding the centre as fast as we could, was almost impossible. All we could do was give people home protection kits, containing gloves, gowns and masks, so that they could be cared for by their loved ones with less chance of infecting them.</p> <p>A week ago, MSF’s president spoke at the UN and called on states with biohazard response capability to urgently send teams to west Africa. To have any hope of getting the outbreak under control we need more treatment beds for Ebola patients and we need them yesterday. We are worried that if left to UN agencies and NGOs it will take too much time to respond – more lives will be lost and the virus will spread even further.</p> <p>MSF is currently providing 160 beds in Monrovia, we will soon have 200, and we will carry on expanding as fast as we can. But we are stretched to capacity by our work elsewhere on the outbreak and through the rest of the world.</p> <p>In Monrovia, we estimate that there needs to be more than 1,000 beds to treat every Ebola patient. There are currently just 240 in total. Until that gap is closed by treatment centres with hundreds, rather than the small numbers pledged so far, the misery of turning people away at our gates will continue.</p> <p>After one week on the gate my colleagues told me to stop. They could see the emotional toll that it was taking on me. That same afternoon a nurse came to find me, saying there was something I had to see. Whenever people recover, we have a small ceremony for the patients who are discharged.</p> <p>Seeing the staff gather to celebrate this exceptional moment, hearing the words of the discharged patients as they thank us for what we did, gives us all a good reason to be there. Looking around I saw tears in all of my colleagues’ eyes. Sometimes there are good reasons to cry.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/ebola-virus-sierra-leone <p>It’s midnight and I am driving around the East End of Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital, with a young taxi driver known as Human Right. For the past year I have regularly accompanied Human Right while he works as part of my doctoral research in anthropology. The East End is usually buzzing at night; every junction packed with people drinking, eating street food, and hanging out. But tonight there are only a handful of passengers. “The streets are dry,” Human Right says.</p> <p>The rainy season is slowing down now, which normally means more people on the streets and more business for many, including taxi drivers. But in the past month <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/06/sierra-leone-lockdown-ebola-outbreak">Sierra Leone’s government has issued numerous restrictions</a> to try to tackle the country’s Ebola outbreak. Motorbike taxis are running on a limited basis during daylight hours. Places of assembly, such as bars, cinemas and schools, are closed around the country. Travel in and out of the outbreak epicentres in the east is severely restricted. Many people do not have places to go, or money to spend.<br /></p> <p>Human Right says out that Sierra Leone’s elite are not suffering from the Ebola epidemic as much as ordinary people. He’s not the only one who believes that some even stand to benefit from donations from the international community and local big businesses. Wealthy people also have a lower risk of infection than those who work on the streets. </p> <p>We approach a police checkpoint as we head downtown. They pull us over and point out various problems with the car, threatening to take us to the police station. As expected, Human Right gives them a portion of his earnings and we continue.</p> <p>With fewer drivers on the streets the traffic police, who gain rely on income from bribes and fines, are resorting to harsher penalties. Human Right is confident that the crisis will end soon; the dry weather will kill the virus, which thrives, he believes, in wet.</p> <p> But some are less sure. Abdul Johnson is a police officer, a neighbour and a drinking buddy. A few months ago, when it wasn’t clear to anyone whether all the talk about Ebola was rumour, conspiracy or reality, Johnson was sceptical. </p> <p>He suggested that Ebola had been fabricated by the government to siphon international aid money; or that it was part of a terrorist plot to drain the country’s resources. Now, like many others, he is critical of the government for not acting more quickly when the outbreak began in neighbouring Guinea, allowing the virus to fester and spread. </p> <p>These suspicions of the government are not uncommon or, in other cases, unfounded. They reflect genuine experiences of corruption and inequality. </p> <p>Most people here feel a sense of disconnect between their own experiences and the international media reports that place them in the heart of a global crisis. Everyone I speak to insists they do not know anyone who has Ebola; the epicentres of the disease are in the east, several hours drive from Freetown. They point out that Sierra Leoneans suffer all the time in multiple ways, but rarely get the international attention and relief that is being directed at Ebola.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-2450f6e4-ca5c-4282-b0fe-4eb6b04892cf"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/10/1410351776238/03bd3392-1611-49c7-9658-6d639fdd9a7c-460x276.jpeg" alt="A sign outside a Freetown hospital in Sierra Leone warning of the dangers of Ebola." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">A sign outside a Freetown hospital warning of the dangers of Ebola.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Carl De Souza/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Johnson compares this to the way residents of Freetown experienced the country’s civil war, which took place between 1991 and 2002. For many of those years the war did not seem to have reached Freetown. Most of the fighting was taking place in the provinces – the same regions that are most affected by Ebola. </p> <p>Thousands fled to the capital but for long periods it was hard to travel because then, like now, roads were often heavily policed or blocked. But life continued in Freetown, albeit with an even greater sense of uncertainty, until the city was invaded in January 1999 with disastrous consequences. <br /></p> <p>Similar insecurities are being felt in Freetown now. It is not just school and work that have been affected. Johnson is waiting until the restrictions on gatherings are lifted – and also until more money becomes available – to perform the naming ceremony for his new-born son. Most people I know are waiting for normality and greater clarity, rather than disaster.</p> <p>One such person is Hawa Bangura, who runs a small grocery shop outside her mother’s house in Congo Town. She set up the shop in partnership with her boyfriend, who works as a receptionist at a guesthouse and restaurant frequented by expats. Bangura is half-way through a four year university course in financial services but does not know whether classes will start as usual next month. Her boyfriend has been laid off until further notice; most potential customers have left the country and most airlines have stopped flying to Sierra Leone. </p> <p>This puts more pressure on Bangura, as there are more people relying solely on the shop. At the same time stock prices have risen. Many items are imported through Guinea but with the border currently closed they are either smuggled at great cost or sourced elsewhere. Goods from Sierra Leone, such as coal and palm oil, are also harder to obtain now that the <em>luma</em>, the weekly produce markets, have been banned.</p> <p>The vast majority of Freetown residents have yet to witness a single case of Ebola firsthand, yet it remains the dominant topic of conversation. There’s a joke doing the rounds that involves friends starting to shake hands but then comically turning away, as if to avoid any human contact that could cause infection. Knowing what to believe and who trust is not easy, and it’s surprising how most people do not consider themselves to be at risk of catching the virus itself. But the economic and social fallout from the crisis are inescapable.</p> <p><em>This article first appeared on <a href="http://thinkafricapress.com/sierra-leone/life-time-ebola">Think Africa Press</a></em><br /></p>

While we have little information to go on, there are a number of infections that could present in a similar way to Ebola, including malaria.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/10/gates-charity-60m-donation-ebola-fight-west-africa <p>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation said on Wednesday it would spend $40m (£25m) – on top of $10m already committed – to support the emergency response to west Africa's Ebola outbreak – the group's largest donation yet to a humanitarian effort.</p><p>"It became clear to us over the last 7 to 10 days that the pace and scope of the epidemic was increasing significantly," Chris Elias, president of global development for the world's largest charitable foundation, told Associated Press.</p><p>The Seattle-based foundation, said the money would go to the United Nations, World Health Organisation (WHO), US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and other international organisations involved in fighting transmission of the virus.</p><p>The money will be used to purchase supplies and to develop vaccines, therapies and better diagnostic tools. Elias said they had been talking to the foundation's partners around the world to assess how best to use the money and could not say how it would be split between the emergency response and research and development.</p><p>"One of our key advantages is flexibility," he said.</p><p>Global health and development dominate the work of the foundation, which has given away $30bn since 1997. The foundation formed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife reported an endowment worth $40m, as of March 2014.</p><p>The foundation was particularly influenced by the request on Friday by Ban Ki-Moon, the UN secretary general, for $600m to fight the Ebola outbreak.</p><p>Ban said efforts in the next few weeks would be essential to stopping the virus that has killed more than 2,000 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.</p><p>The foundation had previously committed more than $10m on emergency operations, treatment and research. Of that money, $5m went to the WHO for emergency operations and research and development.</p><p>Another $5m went to the US Fund for Unicef to support efforts in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea to purchase medical supplies, coordinate response efforts and spread information.</p><p>Some of the $50m will support strengthening existing health care systems in the countries affected by the outbreak, the foundation said.</p><p>• The headline and body copy of this article were amended on 11 September 2014 to correct an error in the total amount being donated</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/10/ebola-australia-must-provide-more-support-to-tackle-crisis-ama-says <p>Australia must provide greater support to tackle the ongoing Ebola crisis in west Africa, the head of the Australian Medical Association has said.<br /></p> <p>With the death toll from the virus close to 2,300, Professor Brian Owler said the government needed to outline how it would help the World Health Organisation (WHO) in tackling the worst Ebola outbreak in history.<br /></p> <p>“What we are witnessing is an evolving humanitarian crisis in west Africa and the international community needs to step up its support,” Owler said on Wednesday.<br /></p> <p>“If we don’t, the human cost will be enormous, there will be an increased spread to other areas and I’m sure the call will come from WHO in the next few days for Australia to lend its support so we need to be ready.”<br /></p> <p>Last month, the government announced it would contribute $1m to the WHO to help control the outbreak.<br /></p> <p>But Owler said greater efforts were needed and that the government should support any Australian medical staff wanting to volunteer in west Africa and cover their costs, and also provide mobile beds and equipment.<br /></p> <p>“There was no hesitation by the government in providing support to stop the Isis terrorists in Iraq,” he said.<br /></p> <p>“I’m not disputing that support but we must also provide resources to west Africa, because their lives are as important as anyone elses.<br /></p> <p>“This outbreak is in areas with very limited public health resources where health systems are overrun and healthcare workers are dying.”<br /></p> <p>The office of the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, was not immediately available for comment.<br /></p> <p>However, a leading infectious diseases physician and professor at the Australian National University, Peter Collignon, said while the government had an obligation to help, it would be difficult.<br /></p> <p>“There are many practical issues that need to be worked through,” he said.<br /></p> <p>“For example, most of the areas affected are French-speaking and it is so important to be able to communicate with people and educate them about the virus. It wouldn’t be a good idea at all for Australian volunteers to just run off and go without training.<br /></p> <p>“We also barely have a relationship with these countries affected, so any response must be co-ordinated through the WHO otherwise we run the risk of wasting resources.”<br /></p> <p>There could be resentment among local communities if care wasn’t delivered by volunteers in a culturally sensitive way, Collignon said. He praised Australia’s chief health officer, Professor Chris Baggoley, for liaising with the WHO and taking a careful and considered approach.<br /></p> <p>Last week, the United Nations’ senior leadership on Ebola said the outbreak could be stopped within six to nine months, but only if there was a “massive” global response.<br /></p> <p>Previous Ebola outbreaks had affected central Africa, but this was the first time it had affected West Africa, an area with weaker medical resourcing and where health staff are less experienced at tackling the virus, making it difficult to contain.<br /></p> <p>Funeral practices in the region, where people touch the deceased, was also speeding up the spread, with the virus largely transmitted through close contact blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids.</p> <p>The haemorrhagic virus causes fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, internal and external bleeding. It has a death rate of up to 90% for people who lack fast access to intravenous fluids and hospital care.</p>

"Sierra Leone needs lots of international health-care workers working with big NGOs like MSF and Red Cross. All of that needs to be increased."</p><p>Relaxing at home in Suffolk after being discharged, virus-free, from the Royal Free hospital, in London, a week ago, Pooley is happy to have survived his ordeal but also desperate to carry on helping. Some in the profession call it survivor's guilt.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-446810216'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/10/1410335675067/William-Pooley-and-his-mo-009.jpg' alt='William Pooley and his mother, Jackie' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>William Pooley and his mother, Jackie. Photograph: Laurence Topham for the Guardian.</figcaption></figure><p>"So while I'm happy to be recovered and alive, there's a lot of stuff on my mind with what's going on back there. It would be relatively safe for me to go back and work there, and it's really the least I could do having received all this amazing care and have people look after me and potentially save my life. It's the least I could do to go back and return the favour to some other people, even just for a little while.</p><p>"The more help they get the less chance there is they get sick. If they get sick they are just going to end up in a ward in Kenema with less chance than I had."</p><p>Pooley had not discussed his plans to return with his parents, but when asked how she would feel, his mother, Jackie, took a few sharp breaths. "Well, it would be his choice. We would want him to go back, not as an individual but with an organisation of some kind so he's got the backing. Obviously in a way we don't want [him] to, but I can see I would feel very proud of him if he decided he was going to, because he knows what it is going to be like."</p><p>Certainly it would be different from the state-of-the-art medical treatment Pooley received at the Royal Free, where he was treated after his emergency repatriation. There, he lay inside a polythene "patient isolator" tent, tended by dozens of staff in a unit tailor made for "category four" infectious diseases. The tent alone cost £25,000.</p><p>He was the first patient in the unit for two years. There were protocols for everything, covering food and drink to removal of materials, including body waste through heat-sealed containers. The ward's floors were colour-coded for contamination and non-contamination sides, and there was a one-way flow of people.</p><p>Stephen Mepham, the infectious diseases and microbiology consultant who flew to Sierra Leone to accompany Pooley home when he was evacuated by the RAF 18 days ago, explained that the ward kept its air at negative pressure and that it was systematically replaced because of the possibility of "aerosolisation" of particles.</p><p>Thousands of miles away in Kenema's government hospital , the contrast could not be more different –  few resources and little dignity existed for the dying and convalescing patients.</p><p>Pooley says: "Those wards A and B when I first started were pretty grim. Corpses, blood, the place was really dirty – people just dying in quite unpleasant ways. When I first started there were not enough materials, there was no running water, no sheets or towels to clean a patient with. They might be incontinent, they are often confused, so you can imagine, with diarrhoea and vomiting, patients get in horrible condition.</p><p>"When I first started there was not a thing that you could use to help them. You'd just have to improvise, find a way of cleaning them and try and find something to cover them with."</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-446810217'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/3/1409739034601/Will-Pooley-in-Sierra-Leo-009.jpg' alt='Will Pooley in Sierra Leone' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Will Pooley in Sierra Leone, pictured some of the people he helped nurse to recovery.  Photograph: Michael Duff for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Death can be swift. He felt safe in his personal protective equipment (PPE) but frightened because the infection was liable to be anywhere. His first sign of illness was a sore throat. Overnight he developed aches, a headache and felt "pretty rough" but still went to work. That afternoon he was tested and he went home to await the results.</p><p>"I went to sleep and then later when it was dark I woke to [see] Ian Crozier, a wonderful doctor who is working with the World Health Organisation, out there. I woke to his voice and his voice was muffled, and when I saw he was wearing PPE I knew it was bad news.</p><p>"He was saying to me the kind of stuff I said to patients myself loads and only ever half believed. He was saying to me 'you are young, you are strong, you are going to be fine' – and it's amazing how that can reassure you."</p><p>Behind the scenes Crozier and others worked furiously on the evacuation. Two American doctors had already been airlifted out of the region. At 4 o'clock the following morning, the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, talked. At 6am the evacuation was confirmed. By 10am Mepham was preparing for his trip to Freetown.</p><p>Pooley still had not told his parents, delaying it until the evacuation was in progress. "Telling mum and dad about having Ebola was just horrible. It was definitely the worst thing of it all."</p><p>His father, Robin, recalls the conversation, during his cousin's wedding breakfast. "I think he said 'dad, I've got it'. I said 'you mean?' and he said 'Ebola' and there was a long pause after that."</p><p>Pooley says: "They had loads of support from the Foreign Office and things like that but it doesn't take away from the fact that I had just told them I had a 50% chance of not surviving."</p><p>He did not think a lot about "the death thing", he says. "My fear of the symptoms was perhaps worse than the fear of the death. Working in the hospital, seeing the way people die. Even here with the amazing care you get here you could still die a very horrible death."</p><p>His father coped by going into "emotional lock down". His mother said she could not let herself feel pessimistic. Buoyed by the "magnificent" treatment at the Royal Free, they gained comfort from two doctors who had worked with their son in Kenema, and from Hunt who spent an hour with them at the Royal Free.</p><p>"He brought the prime minister's warmest words with him" said Mr Pooley. "He was very supportive and warm." Robin Pooley says. "I think we did mention the fact it's not about us and it's not about Will, it's about what's happening out there [in west Africa]."</p><p>Pooley says he has been touched by the cards and children's drawings he has had from the public. A Sierra Leone family went to the hospital to give him children's drawings and thank him; another sent 50 red roses to his house, joking that he now needed to find a "Salone" (Sierra Leonean) wife.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/09/ebola-who-guidelines-risk-health-workers-lives-expert-claims <p>An Australian infectious diseases expert has accused the World Health Organisation of playing Russian roulette with the lives of healthcare workers fighting the Ebola outbreak in west Africa.<br /></p> <p>Raina MacIntyre, a professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at the University of New South Wales, questioned health worker protection <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/">guidelines</a> issued by the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control in a co-authored <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002074891400234X">editorial</a> in the International Journal of Nursing Studies on Tuesday<em><strong><strong>.</strong></strong></em><em><strong> <br /></strong></em></p> <p>The guidelines recommend medical staff treating Ebola patients wear goggles and masks, but because the virus is largely transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids and not airborne particles, they do not recommend using higher-level protective equipment like respirators.</p> <p>But in controversial comments MacIntyre said this was a mistake, with <a href="http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2014-08-27/ebola-outbreak-world-health-organisation-shuts-sierra-leone-laboratory-after-healthcare-worker-infec/1361292">120 healthcare</a> worker deaths reported during the ongoing outbreak so far, which is also the<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/23/west-africa-ebola-epidemic-out-of-control"> worst recorded</a>.<br /></p> <p>“I have conducted the world’s largest randomised control trial of respirators and surgical masks, and it is concerning to me that we are dealing with a disease which has a fatality rate of up to 90% and yet we are not taking the most cautious approach,” she said.<br /></p> <p>“If our healthcare workers die we have no hope of controlling the outbreak. There has been no criticism of the guidelines but lots of commentary supporting them. But they’re playing Russian roulette with frontline health workers’ lives.”<br /></p> <p>Laboratory workers researching Ebola were required to wear full protective gear, yet face masks and goggles had been deemed adequate for healthcare workers, MacIntyre said.<br /></p> <p>It was “outrageous” that scientists had one set of guidelines and healthcare workers had another, she said.<br /></p> <p>“It’s like they have no concept of what the clinical setting is like,” MacIntyre said.<br /></p> <p>“The hospital is an unpredictable, highly contaminated setting which poses higher risk of Ebola transmission.”<br /></p> <p>Her comments come as medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières accused world leaders of turning their backs on west Africa and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-29031987">described</a> the international Ebola response as “lethally inadequate”.<br /></p> <p>However, MacIntyre’s comments are controversial. A recent <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61343-X/fulltext">piece</a> in the highly respected international medical journal, the Lancet, said a rational and efficient approach to healthcare worker protection was needed.<br /></p> <p>“Excessive precautions could offer reassurance to those responding to Ebola, yet complete respiratory protection is expensive, uncomfortable and unaffordable for countries that are the most affected,” the authors wrote.<br /></p> <p>“Worse, such an approach suggests that the only defence is individual protective equipment, which is inaccessible to the general population.<br /></p> <p>“Goggles and masks might not even be necessary to speak with conscious patients, as long as a distance of one to two metres is maintained.”<br /></p> <p>It’s a view that Allen Cheng, an associate professor with the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at Melbourne’s Monash university, agrees with.<br /></p> <p>“The issue is whether Ebola can spread via an aerosol route, and the overwhelming weight of evidence is that it doesn’t,” Cheng said.<br /></p> <p>“There has been quite a lot of experience from people who have dealt with Ebola outbreaks that came before this one, and while this one does seem to be a little bit unusual in terms of the number of deaths, there are a lot of other explanations for why healthcare workers are so affected.”<br /></p> <p>It could be that medical staff were not removing their masks or goggles correctly and were contaminating themselves in the process, he said, or were poorly trained.<br /></p> <p>“The other way of looking at this is there is a very limited pot of money for dealing with Ebola and we want to maximise the amount of masks and other equipment that is out there,” he said.<br /></p> <p>“I am also concerned that by criticising the guidelines people may not trust them, which could also be a real problem.”<br /></p>

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/08/ebola-orphans-sierra-leone-isolation-families <p>On the sunny morning he was released from the Ebola treatment centre, Abraham was especially looking forward to seeing his mother again. For three weeks, the 14-year-old had lain feverish on a mattress as others around him succumbed in Kailahun, the remote forested region at the centre of Sierra Leone’s Ebola outbreak. Abraham had beaten the odds.</p> <p>“He was so excited about seeing his mother again,” says Emily Veltus, the <a href="http://www.msf.org.uk">Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) </a>health worker who had accompanied him on the bumpy drive along forest tracks to his home. More than a dozen family members had come out to welcome Abraham, Veltus recalls, then an uncle had shuffled forward. “Son, I’m sorry but your mother died two weeks ago from Ebola,” he told Abraham. The boy sat down wordlessly.</p> <p>In Sierra Leone, one of three west African nations hardest hit, the disease has sliced not only through entire extended families but the kinship networks that traditionally support orphans in Africa. Abraham’s uncle, who is already looking after three sets of orphaned relatives, said he would care for his nephew despite struggling to feed his enlarged family.</p> <p>Many are less fortunate. Caught up in a perfect storm of poverty, fear and stigma amid the chaos of the epidemic, other orphaned children have been unable to trace relatives or have been abandoned. Extreme cases include that of 10-year-old Saah Exco, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/08/21/342216397/the-10-year-old-boy-has-died-probably-of-ebola">who was found naked and abandoned on a beach in neighbouring Liberia</a>. He later died.</p> <p>Part of the cruelty of Ebola is how the disease sows division; as it is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids, it means mothers no longer nurse infants; grandparents die without loved ones holding their hands.</p> <p>“Interestingly, when you had the HIV pandemic, which caused many more orphans, <a href="http://www.unicef.org/sowc06/pdfs/africas_orphans.pdf">90% of them were absorbed by their [extended] families</a>. But because of the stigma, that is not happening [here],” says Roeland Monasch, Sierra Leone’s Unicef director.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-82df278f-0084-4b72-9f15-e7ca907ac026"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/8/1410163775655/a8d9791d-9b43-4eb0-ba87-b65c6906a682-460x276.jpeg" alt="MDG : Ebola orphans in Sierra Leone" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption"> Hawa and Amidu Alieu have been taken in by their step-grandmother ‘Mami’, after their parents died of Ebola. </span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Monica Mark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even in ordinary times, children are <a href="http://www.who.int/countries/sle/en/">more likely to die before the age of five in Sierra Leone</a> than in any other country in the world. Roughly a quarter of those who have caught Ebola are under 18, and about 100 children in Kailahun alone need to be rehoused at any given moment, according to Unicef. With schools closed indefinitely and scarce resources diverted to curbing the world’s biggest outbreak, countless more may have slipped under the radar of authorities.</p> <p>Many children reach the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/24/ebola-the-frontline-liberia-sierra-leone">treatment centre</a> dazed with pain or traumatised. Recently, a seven-year-old arrived after an 11-hour drive, during which her mother died.</p> <p>“It’s terrifying for young children,” says Malcolm Hugo, a psychologist at the 80-bed centre where dozens of staff in anti-contamination suits work. Earlier that day, he had discovered that another seven-year-old survivor had been having nightmares since being released. “I remembered [that case] very clearly because his brother died in the night and he’d stayed with the body all night.”</p> <p>Yet bonds form even amid the misery. In a tent for those recovering, a talkative man wearing a heavy gold chain played up to amused doctors during the lunch break. “I’m the president of the Ebola centre!” he joked. Later though, when no one was watching, he gently encouraged a frail boy to finish his food. Mothers who have lost their own children sometimes care for young ones, doctors say.</p> <p>“The hardest part of the job is telling parents their children have died, or separating children from their parents,” Hugo says.</p> <p>Seventeen-month-old Lansana Kamara was still being breastfed when his mother died. Health officials found a foster father for him while they attempted to trace his family, so far in vain. “I get sympathy. The whole family don die. [I felt sorry for him, he lost his whole family],” said Aboubacar, a 33-year-old carpenter cradling the child he has been caring for since July.</p> <p>“Normally, people do want to take care of really vulnerable children,” says Fatou Fomba, a child protection officer with Save the Children, one of the agencies working alongside the government. But in this “era of Ebola”, some families aren’t coming forward to claim their children, because of either fear or the general chaos, she said, before breaking off to answer a phone call.</p> <p>A home was needed for a teenager, the medic said down the line. Did she have a family available by tomorrow? By the time the hour was up, three sets of children needed shelter.</p> <p>Other pressing child welfare issues have been put on hold as agencies and the government struggle to rehouse the stream of child survivors, despite an emergency rapid registration of potential carers.</p> <p>Crucial long-term funding hasn’t materialised, Monasch says. A recent grant from the UK government has boosted the organisation, but “basically only local well-wishers are funding Unicef”. For now, temporary carers receive rice, secondhand clothes for the children, toiletries and a small stipend, while regular financial help from the government and Unicef is being considered. The ministry of social welfare has opened a temporary five-room shelter for children in Kailahun.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are signs of hope, says Rosina Mahoi, a case officer with Unicef. “Even a man in the village will know about the 21 days [virus incubation period]. Now, people observe and see if the kids are OK. Based on that, they come around.”</p> <p>Growing acceptance came too late for 15-year-old Musu Allieu, whose parents both died of Ebola. Traumatised, she fled her step-grandmother’s home, where she complained neighbours shunned them. Her two younger siblings coped better. Amidu, five, and Hawa, three, have been taken in by their step-grandmother.</p> <p>As Mahoi visited one afternoon, Amidu waved shyly as Hawa bounded up, forcing her step-grandmother to shout out a reminder about the “no touching” rule in force in the town. “You know,” she said, smiling, “people here now call her [Hawa] ‘how are you’ because she’s always running up to everyone and asking, ‘how are you?’”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/07/guardian-view-on-ebola-epidemic-world-health-organisation <p>Two diseases intersect in the west African epidemic, whose frightening scale is only just beginning to be fully grasped. One is Ebola itself. The other is the wasting away of the very organisation tasked to fight such illnesses. While Ebola was incubating away in the animal population of the Guinea forest over the years, something akin to muscular dystrophy was eroding the tissue, bone and nervous systems of the main international body set up to lead the response to epidemics, the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>The name evokes a picture of expert staff constantly conferring in Geneva on a stream of reports sent in by their people all over the world in order to identify epidemic threats at their inception, then despatching teams of doctors and other specialists, organising the shipment of drugs and equipment, providing resources when affected countries cannot cope on their own, and advising on the international precautions that ought to be adopted. That was true in the past, when WHO played a leading part in containing the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2395567/" title="">Ebola outbreak in Zaire in 1976</a>, and the<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92476/" title=""> Sars virus in east Asia in 2003</a>, but it is sadly not true today.</p> <p>A devastating <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/world/africa/cuts-at-who-hurt-response-to-ebola-crisis.html" title="">report in the New York Times </a>shows that WHO has been savagely run down in recent years, with the most eviscerating cuts made in the very departments vital for the containment of epidemics. One department was closed down entirely, another key section had its staff cut by two-thirds, and staff in the field, especially in Africa, were similarly reduced. The reasons were both financial and ideological. Countries cut contributions to WHO after the financial crisis and, at the same time, the idea took hold that the organisation should concentrate its efforts on helping nations build their own capacity to respond to emergencies rather than providing that capacity itself in the first instance.</p> <p>This was theoretically reasonable, but did not happen in practice, especially in poorer parts of the world. The result was that WHO simply walked away from the lessons of its own successes, stripping itself of the means to act effectively when Ebola emerged again. Tellingly, the disease spread for three months before it was spotted, and it was an NGO, Médecins sans Frontières, that first categorised it as a major outbreak. The head of MSF, Dr Joanne Liu, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/02/ebola-outbreak-call-send-military-curb-epidemic" title="">told the UN last week that the battle to contain Ebola was being lost</a>.</p> <p>The weak health systems of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, she implied, have become centres for the spread of Ebola rather than its control, as carers fall ill and patients flee. Dr Liu called on wealthy countries to send military biohazard teams to west Africa, a measure worth immediate consideration. Beyond that, there must be a resolve never to let the WHO fall into such an eroded state again.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/07/ebola-trial-vaccine-monkeys-ten-months-protect <p>Hopes for an effective Ebola vaccine have been raised after trials of an experimental jab found that it gave monkeys long-term protection from the killer disease.</p><p>Animals that received a first shot of the vaccine and a booster two months later were immune to the infection for 10 months, according to US government researchers. If further trials show that the vaccine works safely in humans, it could be used to protect health workers and contain future outbreaks by immunising villagers living next to affected areas.</p><p>The findings will encourage scientists in the UK and elsewhere who have just begun human trials of an Ebola vaccine in the hope of preventing another outbreak of the virus which has swept through Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, claiming more than 2,000 lives.</p><p>The World Health Organisation warned last week that the total death toll in African states could reach 20,000 before it could be brought under control. The infection is spread by contact with bodily fluids and causes fever, vomiting and severe bleeding.</p><p>Researchers led by Nancy Sullivan at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Maryland tested two different vaccines on macaques. The first was based on a harmless monkey virus which had been modified to carry a protein from the Zaire strain of Ebola, responsible for the latest outbreak. A single shot of the vaccine protected the animals from the virus for several weeks. The same vaccine, developed by the US NIH and GlaxoSmithKline, has just gone into human clinical trials in the UK and will potentially be trialled in Mali and the Gambia.</p><p>The US researchers went on to test a second vaccine based on a modified cowpox virus. Monkeys that received the vaccine as a booster two months after the first vaccine were protected against lethal doses of Ebola for a full 10 months, according to a report in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nm.3702" title="">Nature Medicine</a>.</p><p>The Guardian understands that UK researchers are keen to include the booster jab in future human trials.</p><p>Jonathan Ball, a molecular virologist at the University of Nottingham, said that a single jab that gave even a few weeks of protection could help to contain an Ebola outbreak.</p><p>"This is important as it would keep the dosing regimen simple and could still provide good protection in the sort of outbreak that we are seeing in western Africa at the moment," he said. "For longer-term protection to prevent future outbreaks one could envisage using the combination, the so-called prime / boost approach."</p><p>Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the study "gives hope for a successful trial in humans".</p><p>On Friday, the UN chief, Ban Ki-moon, set the goal of stopping the worst-ever outbreak of the disease within six to nine months. The "next few weeks will be crucial," Ban said in New York, adding that this was an "international rescue call".</p><p>Meanwhile, authorities are ordering people in Sierra Leone to stay inside their homes for three days later this month as part of an effort to stop the spread of Ebola, a government spokesman said on Saturday. Abdulai Bayraytay said the government was telling people to stay inside their homes on 19, 20 and 21 September. The dates were chosen to give people enough time to stock up on food and other provisions before the ban on movement goes into effect, he said.</p><p><em>This piece was amended on 8 September to clarify that human clinical trials <br />of the Ebola vaccine could go ahead in Mali and The Gambia but have not yet done so.</em></p>

This leads to the concealment of potential cases and ends up spreading the disease further."</p><p>The move was intended to allow health workers to identify and isolate new cases to prevent the disease from spreading further, said Ibrahim Ben Kargbo, a presidential adviser on the country's Ebola task force.</p><p>"The aggressive approach is necessary to deal with the spread of Ebola once and for all," he said.</p><p>There were riots in Monrovia, Liberia, after the government quarantined a community in one of the poorest areas of the capital last month.</p><p>The MSF spokeswoman said the spread of virus would be more effectively controlled with more specialist care beds. "What Sierra Leone and Liberia both urgently need are more beds in case management centres, and they need them now," she said.</p><p>So far, more than 3,685 people have been infected in west Africa, with 1,841 deaths from the virus recorded in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria since March, according to the latest World Health Organisation (WHO) figures.</p><p>As of 4 September, Sierra Leone's health and sanitation ministry had recorded 404 deaths. Last week, the WHO warned that there could be <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/28/ebola-cases-rise-20000-world-health-organisation-west-africa-death-toll" title="">another 20,000 cases across west Africa before the outbreak is stopped</a>.</p><p>Dr Mohamed Yilla, a Freetown obstetrician and country director of the MamaYe maternal health programme, told the Guardian the lockdown was a good idea but said it would be a challenge to enforce.</p><p>"If it is handled properly and we get it right, it will yield some significant results," he said.</p><p>He said the outbreak was spreading because infected people were not going to hospital for treatment but were staying at home and passing the virus on to other family members.</p><p>This lack of trust in hospitals and doctors was also causing additional problems, he added.</p><p>"People still have heart attacks, children are still getting sick and mothers are still giving birth, but they are not showing up to the hospitals. We now have the potential for things like measles to start creeping up again. We have to be prepared for the bigger health crisis we have on our hands."</p><p>Yilla said the immediate problem would be logistical. If 1,000 new potential cases were identified during the lockdown, there needed to be enough ambulances to transport them, staff to deal with blood screening and the correct facilities in hospitals.</p><p>Kargbo has said 21,000 people would be recruited to enforce the lockdown. Thousands of police officers and soldiers have already been deployed to enforce the quarantining of towns in Sierra Leone's worst-hit regions, near the border with Guinea.</p><p>Tom Dannatt, founder of Street Child, a charity which employs 650 people in Sierra Leone and Liberia, also raised concern over the scale of the lockdown.</p><p>He said: "Can you imagine telling everyone in this country you have to stay at home for three days?"</p><p>He also expressed concerned about the country's street children, many of whom live in food markets which will be closed. "Where will they go?" he asked.</p><p>But Dannatt said he hoped the measure would make the international community wake up to the severity of the outbreak. "It will highlight the fact Ebola is touching everyone. It's not just the thousand who have contracted it," he said.</p><p>"I can see in six or nine months' time, people will say how did we get to this. But this is like watching a train coming down the tracks."</p><p>Sierra Leone <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ministry-of-Health-and-Sanitation-Sierra-Leone/281064805403702?fref=ts" title="">has confirmed 1,179 infections</a>, including British nurse Will Pooley who has completely recovered from the virus after being airlifted out of the country by the RAF for treatment at the Royal Free hospital in London.</p><p>Pooley worked in the government hospital in Kenema, the third largest city in Sierra Leone, which has been quarantined for some time and is the centre of the outbreak.</p><p>More than 20 <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/ebola-liberian-nurses-strike-lack-protective-equipment" title="">infected health workers </a>have died in Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak in March.</p><p>Earlier this week the director general of the WHO, Dr Margaret Chan, called for a massive global response to the outbreak and suggested it would <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/04/ebola-six-nine-months-control-who-margaret-chan" title="">take  at least six to nine months to halt the virus and cost more than $600m (£365m) </a>.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/04/american-doctor-ebola-nebraska-virus-treatment <p>A <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/03/ebola-victim-second-doctor-rick-sacra">second</a> American doctor diagnosed with Ebola is en route to the United States where he will receive treatment at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. He is due to arrive Friday morning local time.</p> <p>Dr Richard Sacra of Massachusetts contracted Ebola in Liberia, where he worked at a hospital delivering babies. It is not yet clear how Sacra contracted the disease, as he was not working in the hospital’s Ebola isolation unit. </p> <p>During a Thursday afternoon press conference, Dr Jeff Gold, the chancellor of the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said Sacra will receive “world-class care”. He said the hospital has been preparing for such an event for years, and that the bio-containment unit where Sacra will be treated was designed specifically to handle patients with dangerous and contagious diseases. The facility was created in 2005 in response to the Sars outbreak. </p> <p>Dr Phil Smith, medical director of the university’s biocontainment unit, said Sacra was able to board the plane in Monrovia using “his own power”, which is an encouraging sign. </p> <p>Sacra is the third worker for the international missionary group SIM USA to be infected by the deadly virus. He returned to Liberia roughly a month ago after two American missionaries fell ill with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/ebola">Ebola</a>.</p> <p>The other missionaries, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/03/condition-ebola-infected-us-doctor-improved-hospital">Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol</a>, were recently discharged from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta where they were treated for several weeks. </p> <p>Hospital officials said the Nebraska Medical Center’s bio-containment unit is the largest of its kind in the US, and one of only four such facilities in the country equipped to safely care for patients with serious communicable diseases.<br /></p> <p>Smith said believes there is a strong likelihood that more Americans could become infected with the disease, given the trajectory of the epidemic and the number of US workers in west Africa. For this reason, he said it makes sense to test different facilities before the need is urgent. </p> <p>“It seemed likely that we’re going to continue to see people like this, and so [the US state department] want to test the capacity of different places and more than one facility, namely Emory, on call and able to handle a patient like this,” he said.</p> <p>To allay public fears of the disease spreading, public health officials said they plan to open an Ebola information hotline.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/04/ebola-kailahun-sierra-leone-burial-boys-west-africa <p>The night after Alfred Jusson buried his first Ebola victim he had a nightmare: the corpse sat on the edge of his bed, blood dripping from her nostrils. When he got up to run away, she chased him.</p><p>Three months ago, Jusson had never heard of Ebola, one of the world's most lethal viruses. Now he volunteers to collect corpses, a job that puts him at the frontline of battle as the disease is spread by contact with bodily fluids.</p><p>"Sometimes when I think of it at home when I'm alone, I become scared. It's not easy to just [handle] a dead body like that," the 22-year-old said one evening after carrying out four burials in Kailahun, the remote, forested district at the heart of Sierra Leone's Ebola outbreak. Malaria, cholera and tuberculosis – endemic diseases that fell tens of thousands annually in Sierra Leone – used to be the illnesses that filled Jusson's days as he worked in his parents' tiny, dusty pharmacy and dreamed of one day becoming a doctor. In his spare time, he worked on the family's farm, saving and studying every day, until he was able to sit pre-university exams in December.</p><p>Then in March, weeks away from Jusson getting his results, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/04/guinea-ebola-outbreak-sierra-leone-liberia" title="">Ebola erupted in neighbouring Guinea</a>. It arrived in Liberia in April, then Sierra Leone the next month. Unlike previous outbreaks, the disease has mushroomed in the capitals of all three countries, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/04/ebola-outbreak-pace-of-infection-increases-guinea" title="">killing more than 1,900 people</a>. Nigeria and Senegal have recorded cases.</p><p>"The outbreaks are racing ahead of the control efforts in these countries," said World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Margaret Chan. The WHO says more than 20,000 could eventually be infected in an outbreak that in the best case scenario will continue for six more months.</p><p>Everything from surgical gloves to ambulances is in short supply, but Ebola's real lethality may lie in the fear and isolation it spawns. One morning, residents in Kailahun woke up to find their only bank closed. Those with cars fled. Life did slowly pick up again, but a state of emergency in July shut down schools. Soldiers poured in to quarantine entire communities and, in these lush farming hills, trade slowed to a trickle.</p><p>In desperation, 20 young men signed up for the burial teams, each paid $100 (£61) a month for the task. "Hunger is killing more people than Ebola," said Abraham Kamara, 21, a fellow digger. They work to rigorous standards enforced by the Red Cross, but pay a heavy price.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-446621903'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/4/1409858955929/kailahun1-011.jpg' alt='kailahun1' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Medical staff working with Médecins sans Frontières put on their protective gear before entering an isolation area at the Ebola treatment centre in Kailahun. Photograph: Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>"When I'm passing, people I know say, 'don't come near me'!" Jusson said. He looked skyward for a moment before continuing: "I try to explain to them. If we don't volunteer to do this, there'll be nobody to bury the dead bodies because all of us will be infected."</p><p>The burial team's battle for acceptance is a reflection of a wider struggle. Amid fear, confusion and conflicting public health messages surrounding west Africa's first recorded encounter with Ebola, Kailahun and its surrounding chiefdoms must make decisions that will be vindicated by time or become tragic missteps.</p><p>"What would people do if they had 10 people in their neighbourhood dying every day?" said Barry Hewlett, a medical anthropologist who has worked in three outbreaks in central Africa. "Would they trust the government; which news station would they trust; would they try to flee their neighbourhood?"</p><p>Some communities have encircled themselves with denial and trenches, violently blocking outsiders from coming in; others have overturned long-ingrained traditions to accommodate bewildering advice on identifying and isolating infected people that can result in victims facing a lonely death in a clinic far from home.</p><p>"Ebola kills!" was the initial motto of a belated nationwide campaign, a stark tone which may have dissuaded some sick people from coming forward to face that truth. The scramble for containment meant counselling was sidelined, an oversight that has boomeranged with vicious consequences.</p><h2><strong>Lacking Knowledge</strong></h2><p>"To me, empathy is the place to start with Ebola. You're asking people to accept they're probably going to die in a few days' time. [You're] telling families to say goodbye to relatives they are never going to have human contact with again," said Raphael Frankfurter, director of the Wellbody Alliance, a medical charity based in Kono, where Sierra Leone's first case was recorded. "There's a misconception that when people don't comply with public health messages, it's because they're ignorant or lacking knowledge."</p><p>Matters haven't been helped by years of mistrust as successive governments failed to deliver health services. Kailahun has just four ambulances for almost half a million residents. Yet the outbreak which has killed more than all 26 previous episodes combined need never have spiralled out of control.</p><p>"It's not rocket science," said David Heymann, who was part of the team that first identified the virus near the Democratic Republic of Congo's Ebola river in 1976. "If I'd been told then it would become a global public health emergency, my reaction would have been, that's very unfortunate, because we know exactly how to stop outbreaks in rural areas."</p><p>Those methods are being implemented on a scrubby hill in Kailahun, the site of Médecins Sans Frontières' biggest ever field hospital. But the 80 beds aren't enough, and the organisation says expanding without more boots on the ground will endanger staff and patients. Fear is also hobbling efforts. Survival rates hover around 50% if early treatment is sought, but of the 1,038 Ebola patients seen by MSF across three countries, only 241 have survived.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-446621904'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/4/1409858253662/kailahun2-011.jpg' alt='kailahun2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A Médecins sans Frontières medical worker, wearing protective clothing at an Ebola treatment facility in Kailahun. Photograph: Carl De Souza/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>As they scour villages deep in the tropical forests, the burial team rely on spaceman-like suits for protection. If a bag of flour were poured over them, the suits should prevent even one grain touching their skin. But once the job is done, these very suits become a danger – they have to be removed without a grain of that flour getting on them.</p><p>"The truth is, no one in [the capital] Freetown wanted to come here and do this job," said Daniel James, the Red Cross team leader in Kailahun, as he prepared to lead the burial team one morning. "Eventually my colleagues said, 'you're from Kailahun, you go.'"</p><p>For the second time in his life, James found himself burying corpses in Kailahun. The first had been when the district was at the heart of the 11-year civil war which ended in 2002. "The boys are brave, but I can see they're scared sometimes," he said, pointing to the diggers.</p><p>Jusson arrived late, held back by the daily lecture from his mother as he set off for work. "Forget about this job," she had pleaded. "Qualified doctors and nurses have been dying. So who are you, that you think you're not going to die if you're doing this?" More than <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/25-august-2014/en/" title="">240 frontliners have been infected</a> during this outbreak, the highest rate ever. When Jusson tried to reassure his mother, she switched tactics. Even if he didn't care about dying, she said, the pharmacy's trade had dwindled because customers were scared when he approached.</p><p>"Tell her you've been trained, it's a job now," Nickson Haruna, an 18-year-old colleague, advised Jusson.</p><p>The youngest of the so-called burial boys is 17-year-old Andrew Neyuma. "I want to kick Ebola out of this country," he said, to nods from the others. "Our population is already very small and Ebola wants to reduce it? No way!"</p><p>On the streets, many believe Ebola was spread by local politicians to decimate the Kissi population ahead of elections, or that foreigners are using it as a way to harvest body parts.</p><p>In part, the rumours are fuelled by the fact relatives rarely ever see those who succumb in hospitals as their bodies are doused in bleach, sealed in anonymous plastic bags and hurriedly buried to halt further contagion. After several attacks, the burial boys began chlorinating the bodies then opening windows, if possible, so loved ones could watch what was happening inside. All of the burial team dread one day being called to a burial in their own villages.</p><p>In theory, one of the three burial teams is always on standby. In practice, there aren't enough cars or manpower to deal with the number of cases. Today one team is dispatched to the treatment centre, where there is a backlog of corpses waiting to be buried.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-446621905'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/4/1409858369476/kailahun3-011.jpg' alt='kailahun3' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sierra Leonese burial team members are disinfected after loading the bodies of Ebola victims onto a truck at the Médecins sans Frontières facility in Kailahun. Photograph: Carl De Souza/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The other team has to decide between two alerts in the community. Dia village is 15 miles away – which translates into nearly two hours' drive through the potholed forest roads. The second village is further, and they want to go there first to avoid returning well after midnight. But residents in Dia have been known to bury corpses if the burial team don't arrive quickly, a practice that periodically re-ignites new chains of infections. The team chooses Dia. Their two 4x4s slither up muddy banks overgrown with elephant grass on either side. A wall of forest green, broken only by tiny red flowers, orange cocoa leaves and sudden clearings of rice paddies unfurls for miles eastward into Liberia.</p><p>Tamba Morris, 28, the skinny local health co-ordinator wearing black rubber gloves, greets the team with a look of relief. The first death in Dia was a month ago. He waited two days until angry villagers besieged his house. "The body was rotting in this heat, the smell was too much. So I called together some youths, and we did our best to do a safe burial," he said.</p><p>No one in Dia believes Mami Lamy – the woman they have come to bury – had Ebola, says Tamba Yussufu, a village elder wearing a faded T-shirt. "But we're not medical practitioners, so when those who are tell us this is the way to do it, we accept it."</p><p>Yussufu forbade Lamy's grieving family from washing her body, as is customary. But three men approach nervously as the team gets ready. If they can't do burials the traditional way, can they at least stand at a distance and say a prayer over the body?</p><p>Many specialists believe unrecorded rural outbreaks – both before and after the virus was identified in 1976 – may have burnt themselves out as people adapted naturally after centuries of living in hostile environments. When medical anthropologist Hewlett reviewed the first recorded outbreak in DRC he found that locals had isolated those with the illness, monitored traffic into their village and modified their burial practices. Still, for many, long-trusted herbalists offer a better choice than strangers in a hospital miles from home. "Nobody wants to be viewed as disease carriers rather than human beings," said Frankfurter.</p><p>International teams have started training local volunteers in how to keep safe. The volunteers then return to their own communities. But in a climate of fear simple miscommunications have had unexpected results. Residents in one village were told not to shake hands in greeting as it could spread the illness. They took on board the advice, but for weeks machete-wielding youths inexplicably barred health workers from coming into the village. "I'd go and I'd wave, just to try to break the ice, and they'd throw stones at me," said one international health worker. A team of locals were eventually uncovered the problem: the community considered waving was a form of greeting.</p><h2><strong>Dripping sweat</strong></h2><p>In this climate, the burial teams never know what reception awaits them in each village. Today they get dressed under the silent gaze of encircling residents. All are dripping sweat inside their suits by the time they've finished. Two dogs doze in afternoon heat. Shaded by a tree in front of Mami Lamy's house, women sifting rice in palm frond baskets scuttle out of the way as the team approach.</p><p>"We have to finish this in 30 minutes because of the heat," James says, his voice muffled through the layers.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-446621906'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/4/1409858495922/kailahun4-011.jpg' alt='kailahun4' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A woman stands by the gate of the government hospital under the rain in Kailahun. Photograph: Carl De Souza/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>In the dim light of her tiny home, Lamy looks like one of the rice-sifters taking a short nap. She wears a pink flowered shirt, and white head-wrap. The team begin spraying a concentrated chlorine solution. They spray before each step. They spray the window, and open it. They turn her body. One arm is lifted, sprayed. Then the other. The red flowered blanket covering her is pulled down, sprayed as each inch is rolled down. The smell of chlorine fills the air.</p><p>In slow motion, James leans over the woman's body and takes a swab from her mouth. Holding the sample with two fingers, he drops it into a bag.</p><p>Visibly exhausted, goggles fogging up with each breath, the team lift the body, place it in a body bag, spray, seal the bag, spray again, and repeat the whole process. At last they emerge carrying the body. A wail shatters the silence.</p><p>The crying descends into angry confrontation at the freshly-dug gravesite on the village outskirts. The locals who have dug the grave refuse to pour in the mould. If the job is so unsafe, one man shouts, gesturing at the workers now stripped down to blue aprons, why haven't they been paid too?</p><p>It takes some 45 minutes to resolve the dispute, and that's a success. Two days ago, villagers stood on the side of the road calling out "Don't bring Ebola here!" and hurled stones at the team. Once, the worst day Jusson recalls of countless burials, they lugged a bagged corpse for two miles through the forest to a gravesite.</p><p>At 10pm that night, James was back in the fluorescent-lit glow of his office. On his to-do list: ordering more supplies, getting a broken car repaired and scheduling a visit to the police station. One of the boys had just called to say his flatmates had kicked him out, a discrimination now punishable by law.</p><p>But there was good news elsewhere. A friend who had avoided Jusson for weeks called to say he was starting to "believe" his work now. Could they meet sometime so he could explain how to avoid falling sick?</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/04/nhs-staff-help-fight-ebola-africa-doctors-urge-uk-government <p>Leading tropical disease experts have called on the government to free up NHS staff to help fight Ebola, which is continuing to spread across west Africa.</p><p>Prof David Moore, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and two of his senior colleagues say it is incumbent on the UK to share the burden that is crippling the already weak health systems in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea – the three countries worst affected by the deadly virus.</p><p>"We believe that in order to support the UK's response, the NHS must allow staff temporary leave of absence from their post to contribute to the global response.</p><p>"Consultant physicians, specialty trainees, and specialist nurses in specialties including infectious diseases, microbiology, virology, public health, intensive care and infection control are well placed to offer assistance and should be supported," Moore said in a letter to the BMJ. It is co-signed by Catherine Houlihan, a senior research fellow and Dr Ron Behrens, a clinician at the college.</p><p>They said they had anecdotal evidence of NHS doctors, nurses and other health professionals who had been refused unpaid leave or permission to go to west Africa in holiday time.</p><p>"We really have to think much bigger than the day to day. The best way to control our health is control the health of those around us. Studies have proven that. In the US, cost-benefit analyses showed that the best way to control TB was to assist the South American countries in controlling TB," said Behrens. "It is much more cost effective.</p><p>"We are a global community and as a society we depend on others. We have to take global support more seriously," he said.</p><p>Their intervention comes two days after the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/03/british-ebola-patient-will-pooley-discharged-hospital" title="">first British patient, Will Pooley, was declared completely clear of the disease</a> after being treated at the Royal Free hospital in north London.</p><p>He said organisations such as the World Health Organisation and the King's Health Partners, which had volunteers in Sierra Leone, were all "desperate" to get skilled staff there.</p><p>NHS staff are trained in both risk assessment and use of personal protective equipment but they also have specialisms critical to the fight against the spread of Ebola including expertise in virology, microbiology and infection control.</p><p>"Their experience and new skills would enhance the NHS pool of expertise for similar events in the future," they said in their letter.</p><p>• This article was amended on 5 September 2014.

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/04/ebola-six-nine-months-control-who-margaret-chan <p>The Ebola epidemic can be stopped in its tracks, but it will take at least six to nine months and cost more than $600m (£365m), according to the director general of the <a href="http://www.who.int/en/" title="">World Health Organisation</a>.</p><p>Speaking in Washington, senior WHO leaders including director general Dr Margaret Chan, called for a massive global response to the outbreak and suggested it would take longer to control than has yet been assumed.</p><p>The Ebola outbreak is "the largest, most complex and most severe we've ever seen", said Chan and spreading at a pace that outstrips effort to control it.</p><p>Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone have between them reported about 3,500 cases and 1,900 deaths. <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/3-september-2014/en/" title="">The latest spread is to Port Harcourt in Nigeria</a>, where it is likely that the virus will have been transmitted to many people from an infected doctor.</p><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/02/ebola-outbreak-call-send-military-curb-epidemic" title="">Médecins Sans Frontières, which says its volunteer doctors on the frontline are overwhelmed,</a> has called on UN member states to send in teams of military and civilian biohazard experts. WHO's assistant director general for global health security, Keiji Fukuda, just back from west Africa, acknowledged that there are not enough people with the necessary skills and training to deal with all the cases in the affected region.</p><p>He said: "We don't have enough health workers, doctors, nurses, drivers and contact tracers. Most of the infections are happening in the community, and many people are unwilling to identify themselves as ill. And if they do, we don't have enough ambulances to transport them or beds to treat them yet."</p><p>Families are forced to care for patients at home, putting them and their contacts at risk of infection because of the shortage of health workers and facilities, he said. Mobilising international financial support and additional health personnel is a top priority for scaling up the international response, he added.</p><p>Airline routes to affected countries also urgently need to be re-opened. Closures "have a huge impact," Fukuda said, impeding the flow of experts and supplies into Africa, and the outbreak itself is having a negative impact on the economies of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. "People need medical supplies, food, fuel, charcoal, and other provisions. We have to get it to them."</p><p>Fukuda pointed out that WHO had not recommended any travel restrictions, "except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with Ebola virus disease or where individuals have had contact with cases of Ebola."</p><p>Dr David Nabarro, UN coordinator for the Ebola response, said the UN system is working together on 12 detailed steps for the global response, which he estimated will cost at least $600m and require "several thousand people to scale up our response by three to four times".</p><p>Urgent needs in the affected countries include communications and messaging, care for the infected and proper burials, diagnosis and contact tracing, health services for other conditions, transport and supplies, cash to pay health workers, medical services for responders, air and sea access, and strong coordination to avert economic downturns, says WHO.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/03/ebola-victim-second-doctor-rick-sacra <p>The second American doctor to contract Ebola while serving a humanitarian mission in Liberia has been identified as Rick Sacra, a 51-year-old family physician from Massachusetts.</p><p>Sacra returned to Liberia about a month ago after two other American missionaries were diagnosed with Ebola, said Bruce Johnson, president of the international missionary group SIM USA, at a press conference in North Carolina on Wednesday. </p><p>Sacra is being treated by doctors and staff at the hospital where, until just days ago, he helped deliver babies. Johnson said it is not yet clear how Sacra contracted the disease as he was not working in the hospital's Ebola isolation unit. The doctor immediately quarantined himself in the hospital's isolation ward after showing symptoms of Ebola, Johnson said.</p><p>When asked if Sacra was going to be flown back to the US for treatment, as two other Americans were, Johnson said all options are under consideration but the focus is on his care in Liberia.</p><p>Dr Bruce Ribner, head of infectious disease unit at Emory University hospital in Atlanta where the two infected missionaries were treated, told NBC's Today show that he does not know if Sacra will be flown to the US for treatment.</p><p>"I know there have been discussions that this person will be coming back to the United States," he said.</p><p>Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly are the first Americans to survive the deadly virus that has claimed more than 1,500 lives, according to the World Health Organization. There have been roughly 3,050 confirmed or suspected cases. A fourth American with dual Liberian citizenship, Patrick Sawyer, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/ebola-nigerian-capital">died last month</a>.</p><p>At the same press conference on Wednesday, Writebol, speaking publicly for the first time, recounted the night she found out she had contracted the deadly disease.</p><p>Speaking from the SIM USA headquarters in North Carolina, Writebol said her husband, David, walked into her bedroom where she was resting as she believed she had malaria. Her husband first told her the news that Brantly had been diagnosed with Ebola, and she said her heart sank. Then he told her that she too had tested positive for the Ebola virus.</p><p>Shaking as she spoke, Writebol said: "I had no clue what was going to happen. Of course I knew what the outcome could be, and yet there was no fear." </p><p>Writebol said the next few days were a blur, as she was transported to the US where she joined her colleague Brantly in a two-room isolation unit at Emory University hospital.</p><p>"There were many mornings I woke up and thought 'I'm alive', and there were many mornings I woke up and thought, 'I don't think I'm going to make it anymore,'" she said.</p><p>Brantly and Writebol received doses of an experimental drug treatment that has yet to go through full clinical and human trials. Doctors do not know whether the drug was effective, but both patients credit the serum in helping them recover.</p><p>Writebol said she believes that her unwavering faith, support from her family and friends, the specially trained staff at Emerson as well as the experimental serum all played a role in her recovery.</p><p>On Tuesday, Brantly and his wife, Amber, sat down with NBC News' Matt Lauer to speak for the first time about his experience fighting the deadly disease.</p><p>Brantly said he woke up on 23 July feeling a "little off". He said he felt warm and had a low fever. Brantly said he was first tested for malaria, but to his dismay, the results came back negative. At that point, he said his family and friends starting praying for it to be dengue fever.</p><p>Brantly said he was thankful Amber and his two children had already left the country by the time he fell ill. His wife and children had returned to Texas for a wedding.</p><p>Amber said she couldn't even relate the emotions she felt when her husband called her with the news that he had contracted Ebola.</p><p>"I knew what was coming," Amber said, brushing away tears. "I'd seen him treat these people who had already been diagnosed and I knew how it ends. I knew how everyone had ended up so far. So I had the disadvantage of having the knowledge of the course of the disease. I was scared."</p><p>Just weeks ago, doctors declared Brantly and Writebol virus-free and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/21/ebola-americans-released-hopsital-recovery-doctors">discharged them from the hospital</a>. The Brantly family has been living in seclusion in Asheville, North Carolina, since his release from the hospital. Brantly said he is still weak but improving each day.</p><p>Brantly said he wanted to share his story to draw attention to the ongoing crisis in west Africa, which on Tuesday, the director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tom Frieden, said was "spiraling out of control".</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/03/africa-top-level-corruption-culture-mistrust-ebola-crisis <p>Trust is in short supply in Africa. This was made painfully obvious during the recent Ebola virus outbreak, when significant numbers of Sierra Leoneans, Guineans and Liberians seemed convinced that the rapid spread of the disease in their countries was a western conspiracy or, worse still, a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/06/us-health-ebola-idUSKBN0G61ID20140806" title="">plan by their own governments</a> to harm them.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Nigeria, where 17 cases of Ebola have been confirmed so far, the government is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/06/ebola-outbreak-nurse-nigeria-dies" title="">struggling to find</a> doctors and nurses willing to care for the patients, despite offering daily wages of €280 (£221) and €210 respectively (well above standard pay), along with €140,000 in life insurance. Why the reluctance? “Because those financial promises cannot be trusted. The government is still owing medical personnel overdue allowances it seems unwilling to pay, so people fear risking their lives with no backup,” one Lagos-based doctor told me, preferring not to be named.</p> <p>A collective memory of having been taken for a ride once too often has left Africans deeply mistrustful of their governments, and cynical about any promises they make. Of course, it is not only in Africa that people are cynical about politicians these days. For instance, <a href="http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3184/Trust-in-MPs-poll.aspx" title="">only one in five</a> Britons trust their MPs to tell the truth, according to a 2013 survey. Yet, it is hard to imagine UK doctors disbelieving a British government’s public commitment to pay them or provide insurance cover in a parallel situation.</p> <p>Much less can one imagine (rational) British citizens believing their political leaders could be trying to infect them with a deadly virus. Despite the often harsh criticism that Britons, and Europeans in general, mete out to their politicians, they still harbour trust that the state will come to their aid in the event of an emergency, and that their governments are somewhat interested in their welfare. Africans have scant basis for such confidence. I know that many Nigerians wouldn’t put anything past their rulers.</p> <p>Worse still, nowadays this cynicism and mistrust is not restricted to politicians alone. Each time I visit Nigeria (every couple of months), friends and family feel the need to advise me how careful I should be of those who might want to cheat, rob, kidnap or take advantage of me in one way or the other. Every time the list of dangers I’m presented with is longer than the last one. If only this was all just good old-fashioned paranoia. It’s not. Nigerians live under a tremendous amount of emotional strain because their government exhibits little interest in providing them with even the most minimal sense of security.</p> <p>Violent crime is rampant, while policemen sit in their offices counting their take for the day from the bribes and extortion money they’ve collected. Call them for help while you are being robbed and they will probably tell you they have no fuel to make the trip. Citizens are left to fend for themselves against criminals.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the newspapers are full of allegations about the embezzlement of billions by politicians. This year, Nigeria’s then central bank governor, Lamido Sanusi, said $20bn in oil revenue had gone “missing”. But Sanusi’s accusation then rebounded as the country’s president, Goodluck Jonathan, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26270561" title="">dismissed his claims and suspended him</a>. The Nigerian government has said Sanusi’s “tenure [was] characterised by various acts of financial recklessness and misconduct”. Two years ago it <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201206210904.html" title="">emerged that</a> top government officials in charge of pension funds had diverted $1.6bn into their pockets. The list goes on.</p> <p>Injustice laughs you in the face on a daily basis. You see previously honest people adopting crooked ways in order to survive. Both the masses and the elite seem to have stopped believing in the Nigerian project. All of this makes a perfect breeding ground for cynicism, mistrust and fear. In fact, my wonder is that there are still Nigerians who are willing to trust anybody.</p> <p>This lack of trust in the state and between citizens cannot but cost dearly.</p> <p>In an atmosphere where people often assume the worst intentions in others, many potentially fruitful relationships are inevitably forgone, and possible business transactions never happen because no one wants to risk being shortchanged. People practise corruption because they are convinced others are doing the same. The cycle continues.</p> <p>The worst legacy of the current crop of crooked African rulers is not the poor infrastructure, the lack of proper healthcare or even the corruption; it is the seed of doubt and mistrust that their actions have sown in people’s minds. Roads and highways can be built in the space of a few years and the Ebola outbreak will most likely be curbed within a few months, but the deep mistrust and cynicism pervasive in many African societies will continue to impede progress on the continent for decades to come.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/02/third-american-diagnosed-ebola-doctor-liberia <p>A second US physician has contracted the deadly Ebola virus while treating patients in Liberia, an aid group confirmed on Tuesday.</p> <p>The infected American doctor was treating obstetrics patients at a hospital in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, the international Christian mission organization SIM USA said in a statement. Identifying the doctor only as male, the statement said he was not working in the hospital’s Ebola isolation unit. </p> <p>The doctor isolated himself immediately after realizing he was showing symptoms of the virus, which can include vomiting, diarrhea and in some cases internal and external bleeding. The disease, once symptomatic, can kill within five days.</p> <p>The organization said it is not yet known how the doctor contracted Ebola. </p> <p>The doctor’s diagnosis comes just weeks after two US humanitarian workers, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/21/american-ebola-discharged-hospital-kent-brantly">who had been infected with Ebola</a>, were cleared of the virus and discharged from care at Emory University hospital in Atlanta. </p> <p>Dr Kent Brantly of Texas and Nancy Writebol, a missionary from North Carolina, received doses of an experimental drug treatment that has yet to go through full clinical and human trials.</p> <p>A fourth American, a civil servant with dual American-Liberian citizenship, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/ebola-nigerian-capital">died in Monrovia last month</a>.</p> <p>“My heart was deeply saddened, but my faith was not shaken, when I learned another of our missionary doctors contracted Ebola,” said Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA. “As a global mission, we are surrounding our missionary with prayer, as well as our Liberian SIM/ELWA colleagues, who continue fighting the Ebola epidemic in Liberia. We have gifted Liberian doctors, medical staff and support staff who are carrying on the fight.”<br /></p> <p>It has been just over five months since the first case of Ebola was confirmed in Guinea, spreading quickly into Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. According to the World Health Organization <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/29-august-2014.pdf?ua=1">3,052</a> people are confirmed or suspected to have have contracted the disease. </p> <p>The WHO warned last week that the number of Ebola cases could rise to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/28/ebola-cases-rise-20000-world-health-organisation-west-africa-death-toll">20,000 </a>in the next six months as the outbreak accelerates in west Africa, where the death toll has reached 1,546. There is a survival rate for this Ebola outbreak is roughly 47%, which has been higher than previous outbreaks.</p> <p>Speaking on Tuesday after a trip to the west African countries dealing with the outbreak, the director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tom Frieden, echoed the WHO’s plea for a swift and international response to the outbreak.</p> <p>“The window of opportunity really is closing,” Frieden said. “I could not possibly overstate the need for an urgent response.”</p> <p>Also on Tuesday, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced it would speed up development of an Ebola treatment drug manufactured by the San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical. HHS said that work on the Ebola drug would be funded by a contract worth up to $42.3m.<br /></p> <p>The manufacturer said in mid-August that supplies of its drug, Zmapp, have been <a href="http://www.mappbio.com/">exhausted</a>. The two US missionaries made full recoveries after being the first people in the world to take Zmapp. Their success raised hopes of the drug’s efficacy, but doctors said they were unclear if it had helped. Also, a Liberian doctor and a Spanish missionary priest who were treated with the drug died from the virus. </p> <p>The limited supply of the drug has sparked an ethical debate about who should receive it. </p> <p>News of a third American contracting the disease comes on the heels of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/28/gsk-to-testing-ebola-vaccine-humans">an announcement</a> by the National Institutes of Health that it is set to begin its<a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-ebola-vaccine-trial-20140828,0,5832758.story"> first human trials</a> for the Ebola vaccine this week, the Baltimore Sun reported. The trials will first take place in Maryland, then in the United Kingdom and, with the appropriate approval, in Gambia and Mali. Humans involved with the clinical trial will not be infected with the virus.<br /></p> <p>The vaccine, which is different than the experimental Ebola drug given to infected patients, would be used to prevent people from contracting the disease. There is currently no cure for the disease.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/02/ebola-outbreak-call-send-military-curb-epidemic <p>Military teams should be sent to west Africa immediately if there is to be any hope of controlling the Ebola epidemic, doctors on the frontline told the United Nations on Tuesday, painting a stark picture of health workers dying, patients left without care and infectious bodies lying in the streets.</p><p>The international president of Médecins sans Frontières (MSF), Dr Joanne Liu, told member states that although alarm bells had been ringing for six months, the response had been too little, too late and no amount of vaccinations and new drugs would be able to prevent the escalating disaster.</p><p>"Six months into the worst Ebola epidemic in history, the world is losing the battle to contain it," Liu said.</p><p>"In west Africa, cases and deaths continue to surge," she said. "Riots are breaking out. Isolation centres are overwhelmed. Health workers on the frontline are becoming infected and are dying in shocking numbers.</p><p>"Others have fled in fear, leaving people without care for even the most common illnesses. Entire health systems have crumbled."</p><p>She said Ebola treatment centres had been reduced to places where people went to die alone.</p><p>"It is impossible to keep up with the sheer number of infected people pouring into facilities. In Sierra Leone, infectious bodies are rotting in the streets," she said. "Rather than building new Ebola care centres in Liberia, we are forced to build crematoria."</p><p>The World Health Organisation estimated last week that 20,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone could be infected even if the outbreak is brought under control within three months. Médecins sans Frontières has doubled its staff of volunteer doctors in the region but is unable to cope.</p><p>The epidemic can be stopped, said Liu, but only if governments send in biohazard teams and equipment.</p><p>"Many of the member states represented here today have invested heavily in biological threat response," she said at the UN. "You have a political and humanitarian responsibility to immediately utilise these capabilities in Ebola-affected countries.</p><p>"To curb the epidemic, it is imperative that states immediately deploy civilian and military assets with expertise in biohazard containment. I call upon you to dispatch your disaster response teams, backed by the full weight of your logistical capabilities. This should be done in close collaboration with the affected countries. Without this deployment, we will never get the epidemic under control."</p><p>Money is no longer the main issue, according to MSF, and voluntary help is not enough. Skilled and well equipped teams are needed on the ground.</p><p>Governments should send in military and civilian experts who can increase the number of isolation centres and deploy mobile laboratories that can be used to diagnose more cases.</p><p>Military-style operations are required to establish dedicated air bridges to move personnel and equipment around west Africa and a regional network of field hospitals must be built to treat medical staff who are infected or suspected of being infected. About a tenth of the deaths have been among health workers.</p><p>"We must also address the collapse of state infrastructure," Liu said. "The health system in Liberia has collapsed. Pregnant women experiencing complications have nowhere to turn.</p><p>"Malaria and diarrhoea, easily preventable and treatable diseases, are killing people. Hospitals need to be reopened and newly created."</p><p>Lastly, she said, there must be a change of approach by affected countries. "Coercive measures, such as laws criminalising the failure to report suspected cases, and forced quarantines, are driving people underground.</p><p>"This is leading to the concealment of cases, and is pushing the sick away from health systems. These measures have only served to breed fear and unrest, rather than contain the virus."</p><p>Liu was speaking as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/ebola-liberian-nurses-strike-lack-protective-equipment" title="">nurses in Liberia went on strike</a> for better pay and equipment to protect themselves from Ebola.</p><p>John Tugbeh, spokesman for the strikers at John F Kennedy hospital in Monrovia, said the nurses would not return to work until they are supplied with "personal protective equipment (PPEs)", the clothing that guards against infectious diseases.</p><p>"From the beginning of the Ebola outbreak we have not had any protective equipment to work with. As a result, so many doctors got infected by the virus. We have to stay home until we get the PPEs," he said.</p><p>The surgical section at John F Kennedy hospital is the only trauma referral centre in Liberia. The hospital closed temporarily in July owing to the infections and deaths of an unspecified number of health workers who had been treating Ebola patients.</p><p>"We need proper equipment to work with [and] we need better pay because we are going to risk our lives," Tugbeh said.</p><p>The UN has also warned of serious food shortages as a result of restrictions on movement in the Ebola-hit countries. "Access to food has become a pressing concern for many people in the three affected countries and their neighbours," said Bukar Tijani, the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation regional representative for Africa.</p><p>"With the main harvest now at risk and trade and movements of goods severely restricted, food insecurity is poised to intensify in the weeks and months to come."</p><p>A UK Government spokesman said: "Britain is working with agencies like the World Health Organisation and Médecins Sans Frontières to prevent the spread of this deadly disease. A wide range of further options are under discussion to contain this outbreak."</p><p>Dr Paul Cosford, director of health protection at Public Health England, said: "We will continue to offer every support to the international efforts to contain and manage the Ebola outbreak led by the World Health Organisation, working closely with government colleagues, and partners including MSF and Unicef."</p><p>• This article was amended on 3 September 2014. An earlier version said the World Health Organisation estimated last week that 20,000 people could have been infected with Ebola over three months. In fact it said 20,000 people could be infected even if the outbreak is brought under control within three months.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/ebola-liberian-nurses-strike-lack-protective-equipment <p>Nurses at Liberia's largest hospital have gone on strike, demanding better pay and equipment to protect them against the Ebola epidemic which has killed hundreds in the west African state.</p><p>John Tugbeh, spokesman for the strikers at John F Kennedy hospital in Monrovia, said the nurses would not return to work until they were supplied with personal protective equipment (PPE), the hazardous material-style suits which guard against infectious diseases.</p><p>"From the beginning of the Ebola outbreak we have not had any protective equipment to work with. As result, so many doctors got infected by the virus. We have to stay home until we get the PPEs," Tugbeh said.</p><p>The Ebola virus, transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids, has killed more than 1,500 people in four countries since the start of the year – almost 700 of them in Liberia.</p><p>A high proportion of the deaths – almost a tenth – have been among health workers. The World Health Organisation has warned that the outbreak is set to worsen, predicting up to 20,000 cases before it is brought under control.</p><p>The surgical section at the JFK hospital is the only trauma referral centre in Liberia and a long-term industrial dispute would severely damage the country's ability to respond to the Ebola crisis.</p><p>The hospital closed temporarily in July after the infection and deaths of an unspecified number of health workers who had been treating Ebola patients.</p><p>"We need proper equipment to work with [and] we need better pay because we are going to risk our lives," Tugbeh said.</p><p>It was not immediately clear how many staff were on strike, or what contingency plans were in place at the hospital, which has not made a statement on the action.</p>

"He's talking a lot more than he was at the beginning. He's interested in more things than he was," she said.</p><p>His father said they spoke to him through a special telephone unit, and could only see him through glass and sheets of plastic that enclose his bed.</p><p>"We've talked to him through a little telephone link and stand and sort of see him indistinctly through the glass and the polythene, but he seems to be pretty well actually, " his father said.</p><p>He said it would be up to his son whether he wanted to return to Sierra Leone or any other country where he put his health at risk. "It is his call, it's always been his call," he said.</p><p>Pooley contracted the virus while treating patients at a government hospital in Kenema, the third largest city in Sierra Leone and part of a quarantine zone in the country.</p><p>The hospital declined to comment.</p><p>Before contracting the virus, the nurse had said it was wonderful to see patients walk out alive.</p><p>"It's great seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state," he said.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/29/ebola-breakthrough-zmapp-drug <p>A trial of an experimental drug to treat Ebola has raised hopes of breakthrough in the fight against disease after all animals in the study recovered from the disease, even if they were treated five days after being infected.</p><p>As the outbreak continues to spread in west Africa, researchers said the experimental drug ZMapp cured the animals even those displaying severe symptoms.</p><p>The treated monkeys were exposed to a lethal level of Ebola before receiving three doses of ZMapp starting three, four and five days after infection.</p><p>The treatment reversed their symptoms including excessive bleeding, rashes, and liver damage.</p><p>Three weeks after they were infected, no trace of the virus could be detected in the infected animals' blood.</p><p>The Belgian scientist who discovered Ebola in 1976  said it was vital to start clinical trials of ZMapp. Prof Peter Piot, now director of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said: "This well designed trial in non-human primates provides the most convincing evidence to date that ZMapp may be an effective treatment of Ebola infection in humans. It is now critical that human trials start as soon as possible."</p><p>"I never thought that 40 years after I encountered the first Ebola outbreak, this disease would still be taking lives on such a devastating scale."</p><p>Two US doctors who made a full recovery after contracting the disease in Liberia were given the drug, but doctors at the American hospital where they were received care have said they did not know whether the drug helped or hindered their recovery.</p><p>ZMapp is also being used as part of the treatment of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/26/british-ebola-victim-will-pooley-drug-zmapp" title="">British nurse Will Pooley who is being treated in London</a> after being evacuated from Sierra Leone.</p><p>With no cure for the virus that is ravaging west Africa on an unprecedented scale, there is a renewed impetus in the US and the UK to find a vaccine. On Thursday, GlaxoSmithKline said it was bringing forward clinical trials on humans of a promising potential vaccine.</p><p>The development of ZMapp and its success in treating advanced stages of Ebola infection was described as a "monumental achievement" by Prof Thomas Geisbert, from the University of Texas, writing in Nature. He added: "The next crucial step will be to formally assess its safety and effectiveness. Testing the latter is clearly difficult, because intentional infection of human subjects in clinical trials is not possible."</p><p>WHO's latest figures put the death toll at 1,552, almost as many as the combined death toll of the 26 outbreaks since Piot's discovery 48 years ago and has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/28/ebola-cases-rise-20000-world-health-organisation-west-africa-death-toll" title="">warned that the current spread could affect 20,000 before it is contained.</a></p><p>A team of scientists led by Dr Gary Kobinger, from the <a href="http://www.mappbio.com/" title="">public health agency of Canada, which is developing the drug with Californian company LeafBio </a>wrote in Nature: "We hope that initial safety testing in humans will be undertaken soon, preferably within the next few months, to enable the compassionate use of ZMapp as soon as possible."</p><p>ZMapp is a blend of three laboratory-made antibodies designed to neutralise the virus and was first identified as a drug in January 2014. It is manufactured using the low nicotine tobacco plant, Nicotiana benthamiana, which is one of the most widely used hosts in plant virology. The plants are grown for several weeks before being treated with the antibody. They are then grown for a further week and the antibody proteins generated harvested.</p><p>Prof David Evans, of the virology department at the University of Warwick described the trials as "extremely encouraging". But he added that the results did not prove that the health care workers who have already received ZMapp and recovered did so due to the therapy. Others who also received ZMapp succumbed to the virus, including a 75-year old Spanish priest who was evacuated from Liberia.</p><p>Prof Martin Hibberd, from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said he hoped the researchers behind ZMapp could "receive sufficient funding to undertake these clinical trials straight away as this is by far the most advanced potential treatment option available to my knowledge".</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/28/ebola-cases-rise-20000-world-health-organisation-west-africa-death-toll <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned the number of Ebola cases could rise to 20,000 as doctors in Liberia say the deadly virus is now spreading so rapidly they can no longer deal with the crisis.</p><p>The UN health agency said the outbreak is accelerating in west Africa, where the death toll has now reached 1,552, and it believes the numbers who have been hit by Ebola could be two to four times higher than the current 3,069 cases currently reported.</p><p>"[It] is a scale that I think has not ever been anticipated in terms of an Ebola outbreak," said Bruce Aylward, assistant director general of WHO.</p><p>He said the increase came from cities including the Liberian capital Monrovia, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/21/ebola-quarantine-violence-west-point-monrovia-liberia" title="">where a slum was quarantined last week</a>, leading to food shortages and civil unrest.</p><p>"It's really just some urban areas that have outstripped the reporting capacity," he said. Up to now most efforts have concentrated on rural areas close to the Guinea border. His remarks come as Medecins sans Frontieres said it was struggling to cope with the caseload in Monrovia. MSF has just opened a new Ebola hospital in the Liberian capital and after one week it's already at capacity of 120 patients.</p><p>"The number of patients we are treating is unlike anything we've seen in previous outbreaks," said Lindis Hurum, MSF's emergency coordinator in Monrovia. "This is not an Ebola outbreak, it is a humanitarian emergency and it needs a full-scale humanitarian response."</p><p>The Ebola outbreak started in Guinea in March and is the 26th since 1976 when the virus was first identified, but is widely recognised to be out of control.</p><p>"It is simply unacceptable that, five months after the declaration of this outbreak, serious discussions are only now starting about international leadership and co-ordination," said MSF director of operations Brice de la Vigne.</p><p>MSF said the number of people seeking care at its new Monrovia centre is "growing faster than we can handle both in terms of the number of beds and the capacity of the staff". It said patients are coming from nearly every district of the city and healthcare workers were "struggling to screen new arrivals, care for admitted patients, safely remove dead bodies and transport them to the crematorium".</p><p>It said it is so overwhelmed it can no longer administer intravenous treatments. MSF has five field hospitals in west Africa, plugging a gap left by the fragile health care systems. It says most of the medical facilities in Monrovia have shut down over fears of the virus among staff, leaving many people with no healthcare at all. This is leading to fears of a secondary health crisis with expectant mothers and malaria patients now going untreated too.</p><p>Tom Dannatt is founder of British charity Street Child, which has 650 volunteers in two of the worst stricken countries, Sierra Leone and Liberia. He says the catastrophic spread was not to do with the strength of the virus but the lack of "anti-Ebola measures" being put in place. He also said a food aid programme to help feed those in quarantined areas in eastern Sierra Leone is completely inadequate.</p><p>"They are providing food for a standard World Food Programme five heads per household. But in Sierra Leone there are 12 to 15 people living in the majority of households," said Dannatt. He is offering to lend Street Child's workers to government task forces to help contain the disease and is launching an emergency appeal later this week.</p><p>Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told the Guardian that containment could be achieved by "low tech public protection measures".</p><p>"What we have here is porous borders, poverty and big cities. It is the perfect storm. What we need is a massive influx of resources from WHO, from the US, from the UK," he said.</p><p>WHO said it is launching a new $489m (£294m) initiative to try to contain Ebola within six to nine months.</p><p>Aylward said it would require the assistance of 750 international workers and 12,000 national workers. He urged airlines, including British Airways, Air France and Gambia Bird, who have suspended flights to the affected countries, to restart services.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/28/gsk-to-testing-ebola-vaccine-humans <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/10/glaxosmithkline-ebola-clinical-trials-vaccine-africa" title="">GlaxoSmithKline's experimental Ebola vaccine</a> could be tested on humans in the UK, US, the Gambia and Mali in the next few weeks, in a race to contain the deadly virus that has claimed more than 1,500 lives in west Africa.</p><p>The news came as the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/28/ebola-cases-rise-20000-world-health-organisation-west-africa-death-toll" title="">World Health Organisation (WHO) warned that the Ebola epidemic could eventually exceed 20,000 cases</a>. Bruce Aylward, WHO's assistant director-general for emergency operations, said: "This far outstrips any historic Ebola outbreak in numbers. The largest outbreak in the past was about 400 cases."</p><p>Human trials of GSK's experimental vaccine – which Britain's largest pharmaceuticals company is developing with the US <a href="http://www.nih.gov/" title="">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a> – are to be fast-tracked, with funding from an international consortium. Vaccines normally take 10 years to develop, but GSK said it hopes to finish the first phase of trials by the end of 2014. It will start making up to 10,000 doses of the vaccine at the same time as the initial clinical trials, so that – if they prove successful – stocks could be made available immediately to the WHO to vaccinate people in high-risk communities.</p><p>The Ebola outbreak has killed 1,552 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria out of 3,069 cases, <a href="http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4264-ebola-virus-disease-update-west-africa-28-august-2014.html" title="">according to the WHO's latest figures</a>. It has declared the epidemic an international health emergency and <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/ebola-roadmap/en/" title="">published an action plan</a> on Thursday to contain the disease within six to nine months.</p><p>If regulatory approvals are granted, the UK research teams could start vaccinating healthy volunteers from mid-September. In the US, the NIH could start phase 1 trials – the first test on humans to assess safety and efficacy – at its clinical centre in Bethesda, Maryland, as soon as next week after receiving the green light from the US health regulator, the Food and Drug Administration. The vaccine has already shown promising results in primates exposed to Ebola, without significant adverse effects.</p><p>A £2.8m grant from the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/" title="">Wellcome Trust</a>, the <a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/" title="">Medical Research Council</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development" title="">Department for International Development</a> will fund safety tests by a team led by Prof Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford. If successful, the trial will be extended to volunteers at the MRC unit in the Gambia, and to Bamako, Mali.</p><p>The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has begun discussions with ministry of health officials in Nigeria about conducting a phase 1 safety study of the vaccine among healthy adults.</p><p>The Oxford study will involve 60 healthy volunteers, while those in the Gambia and Mali will each involve 40. Each set of volunteers will be split into groups of 20 who will receive different doses of the vaccine, which is based on a type of chimpanzee cold virus and does not contain infectious Ebola virus material. Two Ebola genes have been inserted into the vaccine, and express a single Ebola virus protein to generate an immune response.</p><p>Hill said: "The tragic events unfolding in Africa demand an urgent response. In recent years, similar investigational vaccines have safely immunised infants and adults against a range of diseases including malaria, HIV and Hepatitis C. We, and all our partners on this project, are optimistic that this candidate vaccine may prove useful against Ebola."</p><p>The experimental vaccine is against the Zaire species of Ebola, which is the one circulating in west Africa and for which there is no cure. The vaccine was designed by Nancy J Sullivan, the head of the biodefence research section in NIAID's Vaccine Research Centre (part of NIH), in collaboration with researchers at the Swiss-Italian biotech firm Okairos, acquired by GSK last May for €250m (£150m).</p><p><a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx" title="">NIAID</a> is also supporting work on other early-stage Ebola vaccines, including one from Johnson &amp; Johnson's Crucell division that is expected to enter early clinical studies around the turn of the year.</p><p>NewLink Genetics, based in Iowa, is also working on an Ebola vaccine and has just struck a deal with another firm to manufacture the product and increase its supply, before starting preclinical trials.</p><p>Experimental Ebola treatments include ZMapp, made by San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/26/british-ebola-victim-will-pooley-drug-zmapp" title="">The drug has been given to Will Pooley</a>, the British nurse who contracted the virus in Sierra Leone and has been flown back to London.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/27/ebola-third-doctor-dies-sierra-leone <p>A third top Ebola doctor has died in Sierra Leone, a government official in the west African nation has confirmed. The news came as another scientist, who also contracted the disease there, began treatment in Germany on Wednesday.</p><p>Health workers are trying to work out how the scientist, whose identity and condition are being withheld for privacy reasons, contracted Ebola before his overnight evacuation to a Hamburg hospital, it has been reported.</p><p>"The international surge of health workers is extremely important and if something happens, if health workers get infected and it scares off other international health workers from coming, we will be in dire straits," said World Health Organisation spokesman Christy Feig.</p><p>The WHO said the stricken man was from Senegal and was infected while working for the agency as a consultant.</p><p>Dr Stefan Schmiedel, who is helping oversee his treatment at the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, said the clinic would not be using experimental medicine, instead concentrating on "supportive care" such as fever reduction and fluid management.</p><p>"In west Africa the patients die relatively quickly of the illness, or survive and then return to health," he said. "How that will go under our medical supervision, we can't yet estimate."</p><p>The latest medic to die from the virus was named as Dr Sahr Rogers. He was working at a hospital in the eastern town of Kenema when he contracted Ebola, according to Sierra Leonean presidential adviser Ibrahim Ben Kargbo.</p><p>His death raises fresh concerns over the country's ability to fight Ebola, which has killed more than 1,400 people across west Africa.</p><p>On Tuesday, the WHO said it was pulling out its team from the eastern Sierra Leonean city of Kailahun. According to the AP, the agency's representative said the team was exhausted and the added stress caused by one of their colleagues contracting Ebola risked increasing the chances of mistakes being made.</p><p>Canada also announced it was evacuating a three-member mobile laboratory team from Sierra Leone after people in their hotel were diagnosed with Ebola.</p><p>Care workers are at increased risk of contracting the disease due to their proximity to patients. To date, the WHO has reported more than 240 of them developing Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. More than half of that number have died.</p><p>In Liberia, human rights campaigners have demand an investigation into the death of a teenager they said was shot by soldiers during a riot at a Monrovia slum that had been quarantined in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. According to Agence France-Press, 16-year-old Siafa Kamara was one of four residents of the West Point slum wounded during violent clashes last week. His family announced on Sunday that he had died in hospital after sustaining bullet wounds, although the government has denied he was shot, saying he injured his legs on barbed wire.</p><p>"There is a need to set up an independent body to investigate the death of the boy. You cannot fight Ebola with the army," Gladys Johnson, head of the independent national commission on human rights said on Liberian radio.</p><p>In Wales, a doctor quarantined for three weeks after helping Ebola patients in Africa has returned to work, it was reported.</p><p>Specialist registrar Nathalie MacDermott, who works at the neonatal unit in Singleton hospital in Swansea, flew to Liberia with Christian organisation Samaritan's Purse to help victims of the deadly virus.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/27/ebola-epidemic-business-impact-africa <p>When his neighbours began falling ill with Ebola, Sheikh Kallon felt fortunate that he was well enough to continue tending his farm deep in the forested interior of Sierra Leone. Then, one of his drinking buddies died of the disease, and Kallon's entire family was quarantined for 21 days.</p><p>"I asked my workers to keep going to the farm, but they said they don't want to touch money from my hands in case they get Ebola," he said.</p><p>With his crops rotting in the fields, Kallon now spends his days sitting with his family on their porch surrounded by soldiers enforcing the quarantine. The soldiers hardly need bother: lifelong neighbours are too terrified to approach, and a few miles away an entire community that has been unable to trade altogether has run out of salt.</p><p>Rural farmers like Kallon – whose rice, cocoa and cassava fields account for nearly half Sierra Leone's gross domestic production – are among the hardest-hit in the economic fallout of the world's biggest Ebola epidemic.</p><p>The repercussions have radiated from these far-flung villages to the country's financial markets, prompting cutbacks by multinational firms whose revenues had previously spurred double-digit growth and allowed Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea painstakingly to rebuild their war-shattered economies over the last decade.</p><p>Three-quarters of Sierra Leone's 20% economic growth last year was fuelled by the mining industry. Foreign companies such as London Mining, in which the commodities giant Glencore has an offtake agreement, had planned to treble yields in a decade. But London Mining's shares plunged by 19% after the company reduced forecasts in part because of the Ebola crisis this year. The British firm has now moved some workers from Sierra Leone. Commercial banks have slashed working hours to minimise contact with clients.</p><p>The World Food Programme is scaling up its operations to provide food to about one million people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone at a cost of $70m (£42m). Sierra Leone has asked it to "consider significantly upscaling supplies, even for non-quarantined communities," according to a UN source.</p><p>The impact has spread thousands of miles to African countries that have never recorded an Ebola death.</p><p>Investment summits have been cancelled as far afield as Namibia, almost 3,000 miles from the core of the epidemic, and west African athletes were banned from competing in some Youth Olympics events this month. Korean Air Lines scrapped flights to Kenya, a regional hub that has not recorded any Ebola cases in this outbreak.</p><p>"Beyond a health crisis, we're looking at a whole range of knock-on effects," said David McLachlan-Karr, UN country co-ordinator for Sierra Leone. "The single biggest concern is the longer term impact on development aspirations, which is premised on high foreign investment and high earnings."</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-445627063'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/27/1409152755390/Freetown-011.jpg' alt='Freetown' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A girl walks past a sign warning of the dangers of Ebola outside a government hospital in Freetown. Photograph: Carl De Souza/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Officials in all three countries have trimmed growth forecasts as money is diverted into tackling the crisis.</p><p>Even before the quarantine, Kallon had difficulties. A state of emergency meant more than two dozen checkpoints sprang up between Kailahun in the east and Freetown, eight hours' drive away.</p><p>With fewer farmers travelling, the cost of farm produce doubled in a matter of weeks, said Umaru Barry, a sharply dressed trader selling smartphones in the capital's hilly streets. Barry's own trade was suffering. "We sell expensive phones and mainly foreigners would buy them, but now they've all left the country," he said of the phones that retail at around $700 (£422). "I used to sell two phones a week."</p><p>Perhaps the biggest sign of the deepening financial chill is the silence of Freetown's black market "dollar boys".</p><p>In a country where banks are unable to meet demand for hard currency, their piercing cries of "Pounds! Dollars! Euros!" have long drawn everyone from petty traders to multinationals, and are a reliable gauge of financial health. "There's no business any more," said John Moriba, a dollar boy sitting glumly beside a bucket of chlorinated water in which he regularly dips his hands to kill the Ebola virus. "Normally I have a lot of people calling, but today it's 3pm and nobody has come yet. Before Ebola, that was never possible."</p><p>Many of his clients were dealers who bought goods cheaply in neighbouring Guinea before reselling them at home, but closed borders have stopped inter-country trade.</p><p>Moriba is less worried about Ebola itself than the negative perceptions. "We heard that even if you have Ebola you can sit next to somebody, just don't touch. So I don't know what all this trouble is about," he said. Although the virus kills with gruesome speed, Ebola can only be passed on if bodily fluid from affected patients enters mucous membranes in the eyes, nose or mouth.</p><p>Telltale signs of a slowdown litter the capital. Freetown's only sushi restaurant now sells chicken sandwiches, as its Chinese fish suppliers have shut up shop. In one popular hotel, where 34 bedrooms overlook a stunning stretch of bay, only eight rooms were filled.</p><p>This month, British Airways and Kenya Airways banned flights to both Sierra Leone and Liberia. On Wednesday, Air France suspended its flights to Sierra Leone on the advice of the French government.</p><p>"We need to work hard to ensure that the economy doesn't suffer irreparable damage," said the UN's McLachlan-Karr. "It's not helpful for companies to shut down operations … when in fact appropriate measures can be put in place to ensure it doesn't spread. That reinforces not only isolation but also the perception of the country being in crisis."</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/24/ebola-the-frontline-liberia-sierra-leone <p>Outside a run-down elementary school in West Point, Liberia, health workers stand silent and stiff under a balcony as the night darkens. Their spare supply of white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazmat_suit">hazmat</a> suits, latex gloves and chlorine has been stolen, along with food for 21 patients who were being quarantined inside. Just an hour earlier, locals had burst through the gates and looted the facility. Patients suspected of having Ebola were “liberated”; the mob took their bedding and mattresses out with them. Now the staff are waiting for the police to escort them to safety. They eventually depart, unharmed, but they’re forced to leave a patient’s dead body behind.</p> <p>The school was supposed to be a holding centre so that those infected by the virus could be quarantined in the community before they came into contact with others. The main treatment centre was so choked that one healthcare worker said he feared people coming in without the virus might end up infected. But the initiative collapsed after just 48 hours. At least three people died inside – they did not receive medical treatment during their final hours.</p> <p>West Point, Monrovia’s largest seaside slum, serves as a microcosm for the fear and confusion that is gripping the wider community. The Ebola epidemic has claimed 1,145 lives and infected more than 2,000 across three countries – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – in just five months.</p> <p>Since the outbreak in Guinea began, many who live in the region have been deeply confused about what Ebola is and how to prevent it. Resistance and denial run high. There are reports that around 150 bodies have been secretly buried under Monrovia’s sands, in contravention of the government’s ban on burials. Ebola is transmitted through bodily fluids, and the corpses of those infected can remain virulent for months after death if not treated with chlorine and sealed off with plastic. But local culture is a challenge in communities where world events are seen through the prism of religious fatalism and superstition.</p>  <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2014/aug/22/i-survived-ebola-sierra-leone-video"                                data-video-id="2146286"                data-video-name="I survived Ebola - video"                data-video-provider="guardian.co.uk"                data-video-poster="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/8/22/1408709543316/Alhassan-Kemokai-017.jpg"> <video data-media-id="gu-video-445261334" class="gu-video" controls="controls" poster="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/8/22/1408709528666/Alhassan-Kemokai-007.jpg"> <source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/08/22/140822EbolaSurvivor-16x9.mp4"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/08/22/140822EbolaSurvivor/140822EbolaSurvivor.m3u8"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/08/22/140822EbolaSurvivor_3gpSml16x9.3gp"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/08/22/140822EbolaSurvivor.webm"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/08/22/140822EbolaSurvivor_3gpLg16x9.3gp"></source> </video> <figcaption>Sierra Leonean Alhassan Kemokai was exposed to the Ebola virus while caring for his ailing mother, who later died from the disease.

So far more than 1.300 people have died in west Africa from the Ebola outbreak. With no cure, it is still unknown why some die, but some survive</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Variations of the same rumour circulate the region: that drinking-water wells are being poisoned by the government to cash in on the international aid meant for addressing the crisis. It has stoked an existing paranoia that the lives of ordinary Africans are expendable. Sierra Leone lost its leading Ebola doctor, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/29/sierra-leone-ebola-doctor-dies">Sheik Umar Khan</a>, last month, along with numerous health workers. But it was only after the infection of two American NGO staff, Dr <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/27/us-doctor-liberia-tests-positive-ebola">Kent Brantly</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/11/husband-american-ebola-patient-quarantine-georgia">Nancy Writebol</a>, who were working in an isolation centre in Monrovia run by Samaritan’s Purse, “that the world sat up and paid attention”, according to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/30/americans-infected-ebola-improve-serious-condition">Ken Isaacs</a>, one of the organisation’s vice presidents.</p> <p>An exodus by foreign aid workers is also triggering feelings of wartime abandonment as NGOs fret about their insurance and image. “It’s as though people have just woken up and realised that this is not Club Med,” one expatriate said bitterly, before he was unwillingly evacuated. While aid has been pledged by the government, borders have been closed, communities quarantined and non-essential staff at ministries sent home. The crisis has again brought into sharp focus Liberia’s deep class divisions, between those who are mobile and free to fly to other countries when crisis hits and those who are forced to remain dormant and weather the storm.</p> <p>“Now you have the battlefront all over,” says Jefferson Sibley, a doctor at Phebe Hospital, where the lives of five nurses and a physician’s assistant were claimed by the virus. “The good thing about the war was you heard the gun sounds, you could hear a group of people shooting somewhere coming and you could run and take cover, but Ebola is not like that. You never know where it is coming from or who is bringing it to you.”</p> <h2>The doctor<br /></h2>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-96f3cc58-7dc5-4485-ba80-7375d4e467ac"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/20/1408530917482/77a69a6f-693c-4a75-8516-985b7bf11aac-460x276.jpeg" alt="'I’ve seen some miracles.

Photograph: Richard Saker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Dr Grazia Caleo, Sierra Leone</strong><br /> I don’t allow myself to feel fear in the field. I focus on sticking to procedures. Slowly but surely I’ve built up confidence working at the Médecins Sans Frontières treatment centre in Kailahun, although I’m always aware how important it is not to get overconfident because that can lead to mistakes. Long shifts and tiredness are a dangerous combination.</p> <p>To begin with, the villagers weren’t receptive to us, but they are starting to trust that we are there to help. We’ve invited heads of villages to the treatment centre to see for themselves the work we are doing – they can understand why we need to isolate patients now, instead of villagers being taken away for treatment and mysteriously never making it back.</p> <p>It’s been challenging: you see people dying and there is only so much you can do to help. As a doctor and a human being, that can be difficult to take. An ambulance arrived late one night carrying a mother and her seven-year- old daughter. They’d been on an 11-hour journey to the treatment centre, but sadly, when they got to us, the mother had already passed away, leaving the little girl in the back of the ambulance with her mother’s body. She was so traumatised and ill that she couldn’t tell us what her name was or what village she was from. She died a few days later.</p> <p>But I’ve also seen some miracles: people I thought were goners have got better and walked out – 17 in the five weeks I was there. Ebola is so you can never really tell how it will work out for those who come for treatment early on. It’s different for those in the advanced stages: they’re so thin, consumed by the virus.</p> <p>I don’t disengage from my emotions to cope. Seeing people expose themselves [to Ebola] in order to look after family members, knowing the risks, is very humbling. It is quite something to see older children in the high-risk unit instinctively look after the younger ones even though they’re not related. Being in Sierra Leone has taught me about the human spirit. We’re much more resilient than we think we are.</p> <h2>The mourner<br /></h2>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-a7fe232e-2baa-49d9-a749-665fbc630b88"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/20/1408531246376/d3305355-d0e0-4033-82a1-a4363fa52a7f-460x276.jpeg" alt="'Her eyes started turning red and  her face changed': Stephen Kpoto, Liberia" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">‘Her eyes started turning red and her face changed’: Stephen Kpoto, Liberia Photograph: Carielle Doe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Stephen Kpoto, Liberia</strong><br /> The problems I am encountering now are too big for me. I’ve not really slept since my father, brother and sister were admitted to the West Point treatment centre in Monrovia a week ago. I brought them here by taxi as the Ebola Response Team never came when we called them. My family were all so weak: my brother Abraham and sister Nancy are only 13 and 12 years old and couldn’t really see what was happening to them, but I could and so could my father.</p> <p>It started with my stepmother falling ill three weeks ago – she began vomiting and toileting too much. This was not long after her own mother had died of similar symptoms. It is part of our custom for a family member to wash the deceased’s body in preparation for burial, and that is what she did for her mother. She then started to feel unwell. We took her to a pharmacy, where they gave her medicine for malaria and typhoid and asked us to leave.</p> <p>Before long, her eyes started turning red; her face changed. We called the Ebola hotline and a health worker came, but they didn’t have space for her at the treatment centre and there was no ambulance to carry her anyway. She died a few days later.</p> <p>My community has been scared by the illness in my family. We are still waiting for the response teams to come and spray the house with chlorine solution to kill the virus. I bought some chloride and Dettol and plastic sheeting but I am afraid to do it myself. I’ve not been back there as I do not want to become sick.</p> <p>My father had already lost hope in the treatment centre. He felt abandoned by our relatives, and it’s true: everybody is too afraid to be near us. Nobody has come round to see me. My friends are afraid. I spoke to my father on the phone last week and he said that his condition was not improving, Abraham was OK although he could not speak properly, and my sister Nancy was helpless. I just heard that my father has now died.</p> <p>I’m trying not to be afraid. When you find yourself in the midst of something awful, you’ve got to be brave. I have nobody to help me now. I just have to wait and see if I get through the three-week incubation period without showing symptoms. I’m observing myself. I feel I am too young to die. I have so many things I have to do.</p> <h2>The nurse<br /></h2>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-a98f8625-ca15-4a8a-abe6-cb9d19deca5c"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/20/1408532713249/05f5e44e-0a4f-44a5-ae8b-8821007c4967-460x276.jpeg" alt="'It’s important to boost a patient’s immune system as quickly as possible to give them a chance to fight the Ebola': Sylvanos B Karimun." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">‘It’s important to boost a patient’s immune system as quickly as possible to give them a chance to fight back’: Sylvanos B Karimun, Sierra Leone.

I felt it was my duty to come and care for the sick, for the people that no one wanted to look after. Me and the other national staff – who are from Sierra Leone – were scared to begin with as we didn’t know what to expect and whether it would be safe for us, but I trust what we’re doing here now.</p> <p>I see four to seven new patients a day. They come in on a stretcher and we have to run blood tests on them immediately to see if they test positive for Ebola, but also any other underlying illnesses they may be harbouring: HIV, malaria, or any other viruses we need to treat them for.</p> <p>It’s important to boost a patient’s immune system as quickly as possible to give them a chance to fight the Ebola. We then treat them with high-dose vitamins, we keep them hydrated and we look after them – washing them and making them feel as comfortable as possible. I found this difficult to begin with because I was afraid – but I’m not any more.</p> <p>My family and community worry about me getting sick, but I feel safe here and they are beginning to understand the job I am doing. We follow strict protocols, meaning that I’m very unlikely to fall ill. Seeing people I know from my community come in on a stretcher is very hard. These are people I have known a long time and now they are possibly ill with Ebola. But I make sure I look after them like any other patient.</p> <p>The community around here is slowly realising that Ebola is not a made-up virus. That people are really ill and that the NGOs and western medical staff are here to help. It will take time for everyone to accept this, but I am hoping that a cure or a vaccine is found before too long – and that this crisis won’t last for ever.</p> <h2>The sanitation specialist<br /></h2>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-1a664666-3cd9-454c-b905-0eeca49ff015"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/22/1408702154693/bd32dd92-cfba-4a78-aad7-506bed39483c-460x295.jpeg" alt="Cokie van der Velde" width="460" height="295" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">‘There were rumours going round that we were harvesting organs’: Cokie van der Velde.

There were only a few people diagnosed with the virus when I arrived, but by the time I was leaving – only four weeks later – the situation had become dire. The day I left there were two dead bodies in the street and our isolation unit was overfull. We have beds for 20 but there were 25 in there, with more patients arriving all the time.</p> <p>It’s my job to make sure infection is kept under control: train people in how to wear the Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and teach the protocol for getting in and out of high-risk areas in the treatment centres. I also deal with the dead bodies, training the burial teams in how to dispose of them.</p> <p>It’s physically demanding work. The PPE is completely waterproof, so there’s no chance of evaporation and therefore no chance of cooling down. The scrubs suit I wear underneath gets completely soaked – it looks like somebody has thrown a bucket of water over me and I can pour the sweat out of my boots. Because of the heat we have to be very careful that we don’t faint inside the high-risk units. I have to time it perfectly, working as long as I can without actually fainting – the longest I’ve lasted is an hour and a half, when I’m not doing highly physical work. If I’m moving adult bodies, or cleaning blood from the floor, I will last an hour, but no more.</p> <p>I’ve slowly got used to being around the bodies. The smell isn’t too bad as I’m always wearing a face mask. It isn’t easy, especially when children are involved, but I try to do it with as much respect for the deceased as I can. We used to seal the body bags and never open them again as part of our protocol, but we’ve had to change that because people became very suspicious of us. There were rumours going around at one stage that we were harvesting organs.</p> <p>Families of the deceased need to have the opportunity to see their loved ones and to say goodbye. We bring the body to the fence we’ve had to put up and show them the deceased’s face. For an adult, I place flowers beside them, and if it’s a child, some toys. It helps the families deal with what they’re seeing somehow, I hope.</p> <h2>The survivor<br /></h2>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-d11a731a-df46-4038-9f0a-775e9bee53f3"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/20/1408533195964/851cd631-0bce-4f01-a08c-21c43770dfe5-460x276.jpeg" alt="'I decided to treat her myself: I bought some medicine and a drip': Harrison Sakela, Liberia." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">‘I decided to treat her myself: I bought some medicine and a drip’: Harrison Sakela, Liberia.

I was teaching a class, like any normal day, when I was told that she was unwell, so I went to see her in Sierra Leone and it was obvious that something was very wrong.</p> <p>I decided to treat her myself: I bought some medicine and a drip. I spent about three days trying to help her but she wasn’t responding. At the last stage, she wouldn’t look people in the face. She was toileting every two to three minutes. She refused to eat food. It took her two weeks to die.</p> <p>Within a week of coming back from Sierra Leone, I began feeling very weak. My head was hurting, I had a fever. I was not even able to cross the road. A Samaritan’s Purse health facility worker saw me and asked me to come to the centre. I agreed straight away and tested positive for Ebola that day. I had severe diarrhoea and was very weak, but I never vomited blood like others had. A week later they tested my blood. It came back negative for Ebola and they discharged me. I came out and I am all right. Now I am the Ebola ambassador.</p> <p>I have lost five family members to Ebola: my mother, father, sister, niece and my niece’s daughter. I have no one now, so I’ve decided to stay on at the treatment centre and work here as a security guard.</p> <p>Most people in my community are ready to accept me again, although some people are saying that the Liberian government is giving me money to say that Ebola is real.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/26/will-pooley-ebola-british-nurse-on-work-sierra-leone <p><strong>Will Pooley was working as a nurse on the Kenema Ebola unit in Sierra Leone, one of the two main clinics in the country working with patients before he contracted the virus. Jo Dunlop, a freelance journalist, met him on several times as she reported on the crisis.</strong></p><p>It was a brutal week at Kenema hospital when I met Will six weeks ago. The slowly diminishing nursing staff were reeling in the wake of the death of their respected colleague and friend, Sister Mbalu Fonnie, who became infected with the virus after treating patients on the Ebola ward. Her death closely followed that of seven other nurses who worked on the ward. A few days later, the much-loved Dr Sheik Umar Khan, Sierra Leone's only haemorrhagic fever specialist, would also test positive with the disease.</p><p>Will finished his shift late the night we met. It had been a dramatic day involving a riot outside the hospital followed by a walkout by most nurses, which meant that he and his colleague, Sister Nancy Yoko, were left to hold the crumbling fort. They were both exhausted after working 14 hours and at 9pm were forced to make the painful decision to leave the 45 Ebola patients unattended as no one had turned up for the night shift. They both needed a break to gather their strength so they could do it all again the next day. Will was rattled by the dilemma of having to leave the patients alone. "We gave them water and paracetamol and then we had to walk out. Patients are dying the most horrible deaths, I'm expecting to find several corpses tomorrow morning."</p><p>Will spoke of the traumatic situations he was confronting each day on the ward. His accounts were unadorned and honest, and he explained some of the practical struggles of dealing with so much death when you have such limited resources. He described patients dying in front of him and then being unable to find help to shift their bodies, which meant leaving bodies lying next to other patients.</p><p>He talked about everyday life at the heart of the Ebola outbreak. There were people up, walking and recovering, children playing, sometimes singing and even rare moments of laughter. He described women in recovery, saying: "They were sitting around singing songs, you wouldn't see that on a ward in England, you wouldn't see people singing like that."</p><video data-media-id="gu-video-445446112" class="gu-video" controls="controls" poster="">\n        <source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/08/25/140825Pooleyfinal-16x9.mp4"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/08/25/140825Pooleyfinal_3gpLg16x9.3gp"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/08/25/140825Pooleyfinal_3gpSml16x9.3gp"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/08/25/140825Pooleyfinal.webm"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/08/25/140825Pooleyfinal/140825Pooleyfinal.m3u8"></source>\n      </video><p>Will, who arrived quietly without the backing of an international organisation, spoke of his determination to perform a role that so many simply refused. "I know it's the easiest situation in the world to make a difference, in nursing terms I'm not particularly experienced, or skilled, but in this situation I can really make a difference and make things a lot less bad."</p><p>I continued to check in with Will through text messages and a few phone calls. I was worried for his safety and I wanted him to know that he had not been forgotten. He always remained buoyant despite the overwhelming challenges he no doubt faced. There were rumours of the Red Cross turning up to provide more staff and logistical support from Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) but things were moving slowly and nothing concrete had happened a week later. Will still spoke of the lack of staff working night shifts, more nurses getting sick and case numbers continuing to rise.</p><p>On my second visit to Kenema two weeks later it seemed that the hospital was turning a corner. Support had arrived at the treatment centre in the form of the MSF and WHO. Patients were being moved into a new ward, there was better sanitation. Staff training and a restructuring of the unit were improving conditions in the hospital for both patients and health workers. Will assured me: "It's a lot safer, it's a lot cleaner environment for the patients and the staff."</p><p>Will described how patients who receive a negative test result after recovering from Ebola are showered, given a fresh set of clothes, a certificate declaring they are Ebola-free and a small amount of money for the ride home. Relatives usually gather to meet them and there are emotional outpourings of thanks to the hospital staff and God. It's a beautiful moment for patients and staff that lets at least some light into an otherwise dark situation. "It's great, it's great, seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state and seeing them on the wards and thinking they're probably going to die. But to see them recover and walk out the door is great."</p><p>Will was flanked by a group of upbeat young women who had all been discharged and were keen to take a photograph before they said goodbye. He was clearly popular among the patients and he was fond of them. "They were all together on this one ward," he said pointing to the women, "It will be so quiet in there now."</p><p>It was not only the patients who held Nurse William in high esteem but his colleagues as well. Yoko, the tough Sierra Leonean nurse, spent a lot of time on the ward alongside Will. "We have a lot to thank William for, he has motivated us, he has encouraged us." The leader of the hospital, Matron Josephine Sellu, shared a similar sentiment. "William has come here and offered to help in this war against Ebola, we thank him for that. He has taught us things, he has helped our nurses."</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-445566594'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/26/1409070901678/Will-Pooley-011.jpg' alt='Will Pooley' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Will Pooley's doctors described him as a 'resilient and remarkable young man'. Photograph: Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The last time I saw Will he told me: "At the start, especially, I could feel the weight of the horror that is the inside of the Ebola ward but you quickly get used to it. I don't go on to the ward each morning with that same dread of the corpses and blood that I did to start with. It has become a bit routine now."</p><p>The issue of personal safety and that of his colleagues was a concern for Will. But the possibility of becoming infected just did not seem like an option for him. He assured me at one point that "the PPE that we wear protects you against Ebola, full stop really. If you wear it and you don't make any mistakes and everything is done properly then you will never catch Ebola when you are working."</p><p>He also said that he did not take the same risks that his colleagues had taken. "I operate very differently to local nurses. A simple example is that it's very normal for staff to eat onsite in a moment of going in and out of the ward. I don't do that. So I'm protected by circumstance in some ways and also I'm a lot more afraid than the local nurses so I take more precautions."</p><p>When the small and close community in Freetown heard of Will's positive test result on Saturday it was a devastating blow and cruel reminder of what we all know – those most at risk of catching Ebola are health workers.</p><p>Many, like Yoko at the Ebola unit, were shattered by the news but hopeful for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/26/british-ebola-victim-will-pooley-drug-zmapp" title="">the treatment he will receive</a>. "He will be okay, he will receive proper care in England, we will miss him though," she said.</p><p>Watching the grainy news footage of Will being taken off an RAF plane inside plastic casing, surrounded by a scrum of medical experts, I wondered what was going through his head. To arrive in one of the poorest countries in Africa and spend two months nursing patients suffering one of the world's deadliest diseases is an extraordinary experience. But to then contract that disease and be transported to the most sophisticated treatment unit on earth is unfathomable.</p><p>Will, like so many health workers in Sierra Leone, is a humble hero. His work has saved dozens of lives.</p><p>Before I left Kenema I asked Will what he planned to do when he left. "I'll get a motorbike and travel around Sierra Leone. I'll feel great because I know I've earned it."</p>

However, a Liberian doctor who received the drug died on Sunday and a Spanish missionary priest treated with ZMapp has also died from the virus. Some people have responded to treatment with intravenous fluids and body salts.</p><p>The Department of Health had apparently been trying to obtain supplies of ZMapp, but the manufacturer said high demand meant it had no remaining stocks. Jacobs said the team treating the nurse had sourced the drug through its clinical networks with the help of international colleagues. Pooley, who fell ill after five weeks volunteering at the Kenema government hospital, made the ultimate decision to take the drug, expressing enthusiasm at the prospect, said Jacobs.</p><p>He said Pooley's condition had been stable since he was taken to the hospital under police escort on Sunday and he had been sitting up in bed, reading and chatting to staff. "It's fair to say that we couldn't hope to be in a better place today given where he is with the illness," he said. Explaining why Pooley had been given the experimental drug when he appeared to be doing well, Jacobs stressed that they wanted to give him the best care possible and that his condition was subject to change. He admitted: "We were rather limited in our knowledge about the medicine but we thought there was sufficient reason to go ahead."</p><p>Jacobs said the team treating Pooley had been well prepared, having known that it was only a matter of time before they would have a patient with the Ebola virus and that they had treated people with similar infections in the past.</p><p>He said that Pooley's prognosis would be clearer in a week's time. "It remains a very, very variable course and the next few days are going to be very critical for him."</p><p>The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told Sky News: "We are very clear that the risk level from transporting Mr Pooley over to London remains very low.</p><p>" I'm actually really proud of what the NHS has been able to offer to a very, very brave man."I think the public can be reassured, not just by the precautions that we're taking but by the superb care that he's received."</p>

A Spanish missionary priest infected with Ebola also received the treatment and died.</p><p>Chris Mutten, a member of Eyke parish council, where Pooley's mother is a clerk, said everyone in the local community was hoping he would fight off the disease.

http://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2014/aug/25/ebola-britain-panic-patient-virus-london-hospital-deadly-risk <p>The <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/" title="">World Health Organisation</a> puts the number of people infected in the <sup></sup>latest outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, which has been sweeping through parts of western Africa since March, at 2,615, of whom 1,427 victims have died.</p><p>But public health officials have stressed there is little or no risk to the general public in the UK, even after <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/24/briton-with-ebola-flown-home-sierra-leone" title="">the arrival in London this weekend of a British medic infected </a>with the virus while treating patients in Sierra Leone.</p><p>That's because, although Ebola has a very high mortality rate and no treatment or vaccine has so far been licensed for it, the virus is actually much less contagious than many other more common diseases, and good infection-control practices should effectively stop its spread.</p><p>Ebola is certainly deadly. Many of those infected with it are likely to die; around 56% in the current outbreak, and 67% across all outbreaks since the disease's discovery in 1976. But unlike, say, measles, diphtheria or whooping cough, which are airborne and can be caught simply by breathing, Ebola is quite hard to contract; like HIV or hepatitis, it is transmitted through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of an infected person or animal, either through actual physical contact or via infected objects such as needles or clothing.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-445457664'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/25/1408973822171/Ebola-isolation-unit-011.jpg' alt='Ebola isolation unit' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Isolation apparatus in the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, London, where a Briton who has tested positive for Ebola is being treated.

Kabange said 11 were ill and in isolation and 80 contacts were being traced, and the Djera area would be placed under quarantine.

Through the medical team and drugs, he admits, but ultimately, it seems, God was in charge. And he chose Brantly, not the other 1,200 mainly west African people who have died horribly, which seems a bit picky.</p><p>It must be lovely for Brantly to be so sure of things. I tried, aged 10, to work out whether God was around or not, but couldn't. "What was his actual shape?" I wondered. And how could he be everywhere, all at once? How big, for example, was his toenail? Did it cover Ruislip, where I lived? I imagined him constantly on the go, distant enough for an effective overview and able to home in on catastrophes and act. But it was very hit and miss. Would he be on the spot when you needed him, like Brantly did? On and on I went for years, trying to believe in him. I even went camping with a tremendously religious youth organisation, but despite the prayers and observances, even the devout did some frightfully rude things in their tents. And there was no divine retribution. I gave up on God, for ever.</p><p>Millions didn't. They seem to be obeying his instructions to the letter, which isn't doing the world any favours. But at last, a bit of good news. The Jehovah's Witnesses are mellowing. They have <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28166192" title="">a new tactic</a>. Instead of just knocking on doors, they're also allowed to stand beside their literature, smiling, near shops and stations, letting us approach voluntarily. Marvellous. It's a shame they didn't do this years ago, when my old friend was a Jehovah's Witness. She was terrified sick of being sent to knock on our door. Luckily it never happened.</p><p>If only all religions would take this hands-off approach and let us all believe whatever we like. No pressure. I hope that one day, that will happen. I would say "Please, God," but I can't.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/23/ebola-outbreak-british-national-sierra-leone-tests-positive <p>A British national living in Sierra Leone has tested positive for the Ebola virus – the first Briton confirmed to have contracted the disease.</p><p>The Department of Health said medical experts were assessing the situation "to ensure that appropriate care is delivered". Consular assistance is being provided.</p><p>Professor John Watson, deputy chief medical officer, said: "The overall risk to the public in the UK continues to be very low. Medical experts are currently assessing the situation in Sierra Leone to ensure that appropriate care is provided.</p><p>"We have robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases when they arise, supported by a wide range of experts."</p><p>Meanwhile, west African nations have imposed stringent new measures to stop the spread of Ebola as two new cases emerged in Nigeria that appear to indicate a widening of the circle of those affected.</p><p>The Ivory Coast has closed its borders with its Ebola-hit neighbours and Sierra Leone has said it will jail people who hide patients with the virus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) believes the practice has contributed to a major underestimation of the current outbreak.</p><p>It was announced on Saturday that the borders between Ivory Coast and both Guinea and Liberia had been closed the previous day as the death toll of the epidemic reached 1,427 across west Africa.</p><p>Agence France-Presse reported that the measure was put in place "to protect all people, including foreigners, living on Ivorian territory," Ivorian prime minister Daniel Kaban Duncan said.</p><p>According to the WHO, Liberia has been the hardest hit by the outbreak, with 624 deaths since March.</p><p>Guinea has seen 406 people die, while in Sierra Leone 392 have succumbed to the haemorrhagic fever. Nigeria, meanwhile, has seen five people die.</p><p>The two new cases in Nigeria are causing particular concern because they are outside the immediate group of caregivers who treated a dying airline passenger.</p><p>The new patients were infected by their spouses, both medical workers who had direct contact with Liberian-American Patrick Sawyer, who flew into Nigeria from Liberia and Togo and infected 11 others before he died in July.</p><p>There are fears that the number of people affected is even higher than reported because many people – mindful of the stigma attached – are hiding Ebola patients.</p><p>"This phenomenon strongly suggests the existence of an invisible caseload of patients who are not being detected by the surveillance system," the UN health agency said. This has "never before been seen in an Ebola outbreak", it added.</p><p>According to the Associated Press, the Liberian government has delivered donated rice to a slum where 50,000 people have been sealed off from the rest of the capital Monrovia in an attempt to contain the outbreak.</p><p>In Sierra Leone, a new amendment to the country's health act was passed, imposing jail time of up to two years for those caught hiding Ebola patients. The new law – an update to the country's 1960 Public Health Act – was passed on Friday.</p><p>Lawmaker Ansumana Jaiah Kaikai said the measure was necessary to compel reluctant residents to cooperate with government officials. "This amendment seeks to address these emerging bottlenecks," he added.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/23/ebola-outbreak-blamed-on-fruit-bats-africa <p><strong> </strong></p><p>The largest-ever outbreak of Ebola was triggered by a toddler's chance contact with a single infected bat, a team of international researchers will reveal, after a major investigation of the origins of the deadly disease now ravaging Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Nigeria.</p><p>A group of 17 European and African tropical disease researchers, ecologists and anthropologists spent three weeks talking to people and capturing bats and other animals near the village of Meliandoua in remote eastern Guinea, where the present epidemic appeared in December 2013. They have concluded that the disease was spread by colonies of migratory fruit bats. Their research is expected to be published in a major journal in the next few weeks.</p><p>News of the research came as the first confirmed case of a Briton contracting the disease emerged on Saturday night. Professor John Watson, deputy chief medical officer, said the overall risk to the UK public remains "very low".</p><p>Early studies suggested that a new strain of Ebola had emerged in west Africa but, according to epidemiologist Fabian Leendertz, a disease ecologist at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, who led the large team of scientists to Guinea, it is likely the virus in Guinea is closely related to the one known as Zaire ebolavirus, identified more than 10 years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Leendertz said the virus had probably arrived in west Africa via an infected straw-coloured fruit bat. These bats migrate across long distances and are commonly found in giant colonies near cities and in forests.</p><p>The outbreak has killed more than 1,300 people in west Africa so far, many of the deaths occurring in Liberia. Within a week of the two-year-old boy catching the disease in Meliandoua, both he and his mother had died and it was spread to nearby communities and urban areas by mourners at a funeral.</p><p>Scientists have suspected for several years that bats are the wild "reservoirs" of Ebola, but direct transmission to humans is extremely rare, despite communities regularlyhunting the bats for food. Nearly all previous epidemics had been linked to the bushmeat trade, with hunters picking up dead infected animals in the forestand selling them on. Previous outbreaks saw catastrophic death rates in gorilla and chimpanzee populations, which led some scientists to think they may be responsible for the disease spreading.</p><p>Chimps, gorillas, some antelopes and even pigs – which possibly eat fruit dropped to the ground by infected bats – have all been linked by the World Health Organisation to the spread of the disease, but the researchers now say no evidence has been found of other animals apart from bats being infected.</p><p>Primatologists and conservationists in the region who were contacted by the <em>Observer</em> all confirmed that vulnerable chimpanzee colonies had so far escaped.</p><p>Rebecca Kormos, a primatologist who spent two years conducting a chimpanzee survey in Guinea, said: "The other aspect that worries me is … the human population density is high in Guinea and people forage and travel in nearly all of the forests where chimpanzees live. This means that the risk from transmission between apes and humans would be high."</p><p>Fruit bats, however, are widely eaten in rural west Africa – either smoked, grilled or in a spicy soup. Leendertz said: "We spent eight days in Meliandoua. They told us they regularly catch bats, like every other village in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The evidence is not 100% and we can only say that it is possible. I would not say that the virus has emerged from central Africa. There are huge colonies of bats which regularly migrate. They can travel far in one night. I don't think an individual bat or colony migrated all the way from Congo or Gabon to west Africa. These big colonies are connected. There is a possibility for the virus to mix between colonies. They [the bats] share the same fruit. It is likely not to have even been one species of bat. The virus may jump from one species to another."</p><p>If bats are confirmed as the reservoir of the disease, forest communities could try to destroy their vast colonies. "That would be an ecological disaster," said Leendertz, "because bats pollinate plants and devour insects. And bat hunts would also only increase human contact with potentially infected animals."</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/22/ebola-airlines-cancel-flights-guinea-liberia-sierra-leone <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Airlines have cancelled more than a third of international flights to three west African countries over fears that an outbreak of the Ebola virus could spread, as more African countries introduce measures to block visitors from affected areas.</p> <p>Of 590 monthly flights scheduled to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, 216 have been cancelled, according to OAG, an airline data provider. Although 14 cases of Ebola have been reported in Nigeria, flights to and from the country have not been affected.</p> <p>African countries are rolling out measures to stop Ebola from spreading: South Africa on Thursday banned travellers from Ebola-stricken countries from entering the country, and on Friday Senegal announced it was closing its border with Guinea as a preventative measure, while Chad said it had closed its border with Nigeria.</p> <p>Nigeria confirmed two new ebola cases on Friday – both spouses of medical workers who had direct contact with Liberian-American Patrick Sawyer, who flew into Nigeria last month with the virus and infected 11 others before he died in July. The male and female caregivers both subsequently died of Ebola, after infecting their spouses.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) is concerned that the scale of the outbreak has been underestimated especially in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and that many people with Ebola symptoms have not been identified.</p> <p>Over the past two weeks new treatment centres in Liberia have been overwhelmed as soon as they opened by patients who had not previously been identified.</p> <p>In a situation assessment issued on Friday, WHO said this had “never before been seen in an Ebola outbreak”, and said that it suggested “an invisible caseload of patients” was going undetected by the government.</p> <p>Air Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria’s Arik Air, Togo’s ASKY Airlines, British Airways, Emirates Airlines and Kenya Airways have together cancelled a combined 76 scheduled flights to Guinea, 70 to Liberia and 70 to Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Kenya Airways on Tuesday became the latest airline to freeze routes to Liberia and Sierra Leone after Kenya’s ministry of health recommended a temporary ban, <a href="http://www.health.go.ke/index.php/media-center/news-and-events/275-temporary-travel-suspension-for-all-passengers-travelling-transiting-to-kenya-from-liberia-guinea-and-sierra-leone" title="">calling the Ebola outbreak</a> “vastly underestimated” and saying it was “expected to continue for some time”.</p> <p>With fears growing that quarantining the affected countries will damage their economies and increase food shortages, <a href="http://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2014-08-18-02.aspx" title="">WHO has urged airlines to keep routes to west Africa operational</a>, saying it ”does not recommend any ban on international travel or trade”.</p> <p>It said: “Travel restrictions and active screening of passengers on arrival at sea ports, airports or ground crossings in non-affected countries that do not share borders with affected countries are not currently recommended by WHO.”</p> <p>Riots broke out in a slum in Liberia’s capital, Monrovia, on Wednesday as residents desperate for food rations battled police. The World Food Programme (WFP) said that about 1 million people are facing food shortages because of quarantines around the region.</p> <p>Air France, which has not suspended any flights, said it requires passengers in Conakry in Guinea, Freetown in Sierra Leone and Lagos in Nigeria to have their temperature taken before boarding an aircraft. “They are only given their boarding card if no medical symptoms are present,” a spokeswoman said. Other airlines have taken similar precautions.</p> <p><a href="http://www.afp.com/en/node/2743046" title="">Air France crews refused to board flights destined for Ebola-affected countries</a> this week, rasing concerns that it could scrap routes.</p> <p>Brussels Airlines, the only European carrier to serve all three affected countries, said it would continue flights, while <a href="http://news.klm.com/ebola-en/" title="">Dutch airline KLM said</a>, “travellers are highly unlikely to be infected with Ebola, which cannot be transmitted under normal hygiene conditions”.</p> <p>British Airways, which announced on 5 August that it would suspend its service to Sierra Leone and Liberia, has said it would review the severity of the Ebola outbreak at the end of this month.</p> <p>About 1,350 people are thought to have died from the Ebola outbreak since it began in March, <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_08_20_ebola/en/" title="">according to WHO</a>.</p> <p>David Nabarro, the UN’s recently appointed system coordinator on Ebola, arrived in Monrovia this week as part of a trip to affected countries. He is also scheduled to visit Freetown, Conakry and Abuja in Nigeria.</p> <p>WHO said on Friday it was working on a six to nine-month plan designed to ease the Ebola outbreak.</p>

He had recently arrived from Nigeria, he reportedly told hospital staff. Later that day, health authorities said the man had tested negative for Ebola.</p><p>The next day there was panic at Madrid's Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas airport after a man suffered spasms and vomiting. Airport authorities put in place the Ebola protocol, cordoning off an area around the man. Health officials, wearing a type of hazmat suit, were brought in to attend to him, according to El País. After an examination by a second set of medics, it was determined that the man did not have Ebola. He was transferred to hospital for treatment.</p><p>And on Monday evening, protocol against the disease was activated after a middle-aged man was admitted to a hospital in Bilbao with a fever. He had reportedly returned from a business trip to Sierra Leone. The regional health authority urged people to stay calm, saying it was activating the protocol as a precautionary measure. On Tuesday it announced that the test had come back negative.</p><p>In Germany, about 600 people were quarantined for two hours in a Berlin jobcentre after a false alarm about a suspected case of Ebola.</p><p>A 30-year-old woman from west Africa had collapsed at the jobcentre in the Pankow district on Tuesday afternoon.

Tests for Ebola were carried out because he had been working in Sierra Leone a fortnight earlier.</p><p>His family said they were annoyed that the 44-year-old's body had been placed in a quarantined area of the hospital without their prior knowledge.</p><p>"In its own way, that is very hard to take when there is a sudden death," said family friend Fr Aidan Gavigan. "However, this was the first time they had heard of this news. He was a young man being treated for malaria for a number of weeks."</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/aug/22/ebola-liberia-monrovia-crisis-citizenship <p>“We dodged bullets during the war, now Ebola is going to kill us?” my aunt asked me in distress one evening in mid-July, as we sat commiserating at my house on the outskirts of Monrovia, Liberia’s capital.</p> <p>Back then, Ebola seemed like a looming threat in the way that armed conflict had 15 years earlier. But by the end of the month, the Liberian government had <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/31/ebola-outbreak-state-of-emergency-liberia-sierra-leone" title="">declared a state of emergency</a> and, days later, the World Health Organisation designated the Ebola outbreak in west Africa <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/08/who-ebola-outbreak-international-public-health-emergency" title="">an international health emergency</a>. Ebola has now killed more than 1,000 people, with the number of deaths in Liberia surpassing those in Guinea and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Yet before the highly infectious disease permeated Liberia’s borders from neighbouring Guinea in March, the country was plagued by a crisis of citizenship. Relations between the Liberian state and its citizens were already volatile.</p> <p>Before Ebola hit, a group of disaffected citizens <a href="http://www.tnrliberia.com/index.php/login/522-clashes-near-in-arcelor-mittal%E2%80%99s-mine.html" title="">clashed with riot police</a> at the Mittal Steel concession area in Nimba, north-central Liberia, in early July as they protested that an iron ore concession agreement had not benefitted local people. The government branded the assailants “thugs” and “unlawful”, making appeals to parent company ArcelorMittal before a formal investigation of the grievances.</p> <p>This was the beginning of the bubbling cauldron. Ebola simply tipped the pot over.</p> <p>When looters <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/17/ebola-liberia-clinic-raided" title="">invaded a treatment centre on 17 August</a>, declaring that Ebola was not real and that the government was using it as a ruse to shore up donor funding, this revealed a crisis of citizenship.</p> <p>When Liberians decide to hide suspected Ebola patients in their homes because they do not trust the healthcare system, this reveals a crisis of citizenship.</p> <p>When healthcare workers avoid going to work because their colleagues have died without the proper protective gear or training to safeguard them from infection, this reveals a crisis of citizenship.</p> <p>Those with money have the wherewithal to leave Liberia while others remain barricaded in their homes, shielding themselves from a silent killer with no cure. This also reveals a crisis of citizenship.</p> <p>These actions are not those of illiterate, unreasonable people, but indicative of the desperation of poor people who have seen the state fail them repeatedly.</p> <p>People in my country were angry before Ebola, and there was great cause for their ire. Liberia’s reintegration into the global capitalist system has placed profits above people and GDP growth above human development.</p> <p>On the surface, Liberia’s <a href="http://mof.gov.lr/doc/AfT%20document-%20April%2015,%202013.pdf" title="">postwar economic recovery</a> is laudable – steady growth rates of 5.3%, 6.1%, 7.9% and 8.3% in 2009-12, respectively; $1.3bn (£783m) in foreign direct investment between 2006 and 2010 in traditional sectors such as forestry, rubber and mining; and increases in export revenue from $175m in 2006 to $295.2m in 2011. But these developments have not rendered fundamental changes in the lives of most Liberians, <a href="http://www.emansion.gov.lr/doc/Final%20PRS.pdf" title="">64% of whom still live in abject poverty</a>.</p> <p>Liberia ranked 175th among 187 countries in the <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/2014-report" title="">2014 human development index</a> – admittedly an improvement from its 182nd ranking in 2011. Nevertheless, most people lack access to electricity, health facilities, access roads, quality education, finance and secure land tenure. According to the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/presentation/wcms_156366.pdf" title="">2010 labour force survey</a>, 78% of Liberia’s workforce are engaged in “vulnerable employment” without a steady income, and <a href="http://www.lisgis.net/pg_img/LFS%20Presentation%20to%20EMT-Cabinet-170811.pdf" title="">68% are employed in the informal sector</a>.</p>  <figure class="element element-image element--supporting" data-media-id="gu-fc-9ff6589a-2211-403d-9b87-7ceaf287dcd4"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/22/1408699059101/0e445d12-39e4-43e8-8a0a-1eb917b6215b-460x276.jpeg" alt="MDG Liberia Battles Spreading Ebola Epidemic" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Residents cannot leave the West Point slum in Monrovia until the Ebola outbreak is contained. Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Liberia is still reliant on donor aid – which accounts for more than half of overall spending on education and health – and exports of unprocessed raw materials and minerals. In the last fiscal year, there were several reported cases of <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201405151444.html" title="">budget shortfalls</a>. The current draft budget, which should have come into effect on 1 July, has yet to be passed by the legislature. Inflation has skyrocketed. In April, the exchange rate was 79 Liberian dollars to every US dollar; by July, it was almost 90.</p> <p>The lack of quality healthcare in Liberia is not from lack of financing, as most people have argued. It is from the mismanagement of funds. Contrary to what has been reported, Liberia is not poor; it is poorly managed.</p> <p>Liberia must take responsibility for containing the Ebola outbreak, and any in the future. We must think and plan ahead.</p> <p>We must devise a crisis response plan in emergency situations, such as an infectious disease outbreak, and create a contingency fund for this. We can do this by slashing by 10% the salaries of exorbitantly paid members of the executive and legislative branches of government, and placing those funds in an escrow account.</p> <p>Liberia must strengthen its healthcare infrastructure by increasing the percentage of the national budget allotted to health, which will enable the provision of insurance packages for healthcare workers, train more doctors and nurses, and expand health coverage to rural areas. The goodwill of Liberians abroad can also be leveraged.</p> <p>Liberian citizens must use the legislative elections postponed to next year and the presidential elections scheduled for 2017 to vote for leaders who have a track record in delivering public goods and supporting pro-poor development.</p> <p>Just as armed conflicts ended in Liberia, Ebola too will be overcome. But when the war on Ebola ends, Liberia and its people, domestically and transnationally, must begin an earnest conversation about how to solve the crisis of citizenship.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/21/ebola-americans-released-hopsital-recovery-doctors <p>Two US humanitarian workers <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/21/american-ebola-discharged-hospital-kent-brantly">who contracted Ebola</a> while working in Liberia have been released from Emory University hospital in Atlanta after receiving an experimental drug treatment which has yet to go through full clinical and human trials.</p> <p>Dr Kent Brantly of Texas and Nancy Writebol, a missionary from North Carolina, contracted Ebola while responding to the outbreak in Liberia. Brantly and Writebol were both treated in the hospital’s containment unit, which is specially equipped to care for patients with serious communicable diseases.<br /></p> <p>“Today is a miraculous day,” Brantly said at a press conference at Emory hospital on Thursday to announce his discharge from care. “I am thrilled to be alive, to be well and to be reunited with my family.”<br /></p> <p>The hospital said Writebol had been quietly released on Tuesday. </p> <p>The World Health Organization said earlier this month that unlicensed<br />drugs and vaccines can ethically be used to treat the outbreak which has so far claimed <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/12/world-health-organisation-allow-unlicensed-ebola-drugs-west-africa">at least 1,200 lives</a> in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria.<br /><br />Doctors cautioned that it was too soon to hope that the treatment could hasten the end of the public health crisis: Dr Bruce Ribner, medical director of Emory hospital’s infectious disease unit said that it was unclear if the drug had contributed to the pair’s recovery and suggested it may have even delayed their return to health.<br /><br />Liberian officials have said that three African medics who have also been given the treatment are showing “remarkable signs of improvement”.</p> <p>But Ribner said there was no scientific basis to suggest the treatment was a cure. “They are very first ever to receive these agents. There are no prior experiments with this. We do not know if its improved them ... or even delayed their recovery,” cautioned Ribner.<br /></p> <p>Even if the treatment is effective, the California-based manufacturer of ZMapp, <a href="http://www.mappbio.com/">Mapp Biopharmaceutical</a>, said that “the available supply of ZMapp has been exhausted”. </p> <p>Brantly and Writebol were both treated in Emory hospital’s containment unit, which is specially equipped to care for patients with serious communicable diseases.<br /><br />Reinfection is not impossible, but Ebola survivors are highly unlikely to contract the virus a second time and the hospital said their release from hospital posed no risk to public health. “Limited knowledge of the Ebola virus, especially in our country, has created understandable anxiety and fear for some persons,” said Ribner, who said<br />he understood these concerns. “However, we cannot let our fears dictate our actions, we must all care.”<br /><br />Brantly and his wife held hands before he read from a written statement and he hugged members of his care team. He choked up several times while thanking his aid group, North Carolina-based Samaritan’s Purse, and the Emory medical team standing behind them.<br /><br />The hospital said Writebol had been discharged without publicity on Tuesday. Asked why the hospital did not announce her release from care, Ribner said the hospital decided to release the patients after a rigorous course of treatment and thorough testing.<br /><br />“The medical staff at Emory is confident that the discharge from the hospital of both these patients poses no public health threat,” said Ribner.<br /><br />It is five months since the first case of Ebola was confirmed in Guinea, spreading quickly into Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. According to the World Health Organization 2,473 people have so far contracted the disease which, once symptomatic, can kill within five days .<br /><br />Brantly said the virus was not on the radar when he and his family moved to west Africa two years ago, but he noticed a steady increase in Ebola patients in June and July. His wife and children returned to the US on 20 July, but Brantly stayed on to continue his work.<br /><br />Three days later, he fell ill. “I woke up feeling under the weather, and then my life took an unexpected turn as I was diagnosed with Ebola virus disease,” he said.<br /><br />Brantly, 33, was flown out of Liberia on 2 August on a private jet outfitted with a containment tent and was admitted to Emory, which is one of only four institutions in the US capable of properly handling patients with a disease of this nature, according to the hospital. Writebol, 59, arrived three days later.<br /><br />The two emphasized their desire to spend time with their families, since the nature of the disease requires isolation treatment.<br /><br />“My family and I will now be going away for a period of time to reconnect, decompress and recover,” Brantly said, after thanking all the people involved in his care and hugging many individually at the press conference. “For now, we need some time together, after a month apart.”<br /><br />Writebol has gone to “an undisclosed location”, said the North Carolina-based aid group SIM, for whom she had been working in Liberia.<br /><br />“Nancy is free of the virus, but the lingering effects of the battle have left her in a significantly weakened condition,” her husband, David, said in a statement. “Thus, we decided it would be best to leave the hospital privately to be able to give her the rest and recuperation she needs at this time.”<br /><br />Ribner warned that the fight against Ebola is “far from over”, as it continues to spread across west Africa. “What we learned in caring for them will help advance the world’s understanding of how to treat Ebola infections and hopefully improve,” said Ribner.<br /><br />The two missionaries’ survival has given fresh impetus to the search for a vaccine.<br /><br />US clinical trials for what scientists hope is a promising new vaccine have been brought forward, according to the US National Institutes of Health. Its researchers have been working on a vaccine with Okairos, a Swiss-Italian company owned by Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline for years. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told the Los Angeles Times: “We’re dealing with an urgent situation.”<br /><br />The disease is out of control in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the two worst-affected countries in west Africa, both of which have declared states of emergency.<br /><br />This week MSF director of operations Brice de la Vigne <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/19/western-leaders-ebola-outbreak-africa-medecins-sans-frontieres ">told the Guardian </a>the international community was paying “almost zero” interest in the crisis, saying the outbreak would not be contained unless western leaders implemented an emergency operation comparable with the response to a natural disaster.</p>

Countries not affected yet by Ebola should by now have tested their systems, processes, knowledge and understanding of them.</p> <p><strong>Encourage behaviour change before epidemics:</strong> The more we invest in behaviour change communication at a household and community level, the less overwhelmed hospitals will be during an epidemic. Advocacy for behaviour change has worked for HIV and Aids.</p> <p><strong>Stop supply issues becoming the issue during an epidemic:</strong> It is easy for fragile supply chain infrastructure to crumble during a disaster.

They fear they are either bringing the disease themselves or coming to take people away to treatment centres from which they won’t come back.</p> <p><strong>Different government departments must co-ordinate before epidemics:</strong> Too often diseases are considered the purview of health and not of the other sectors connected to this – like agriculture, infrastructure, security etc. Taskforces are set up in times of emergency response, but these parts of government need to interact more outside of crisis times, when the space for building resilience is more likely to exist.</p> <p><strong>Rethink training for community health workers:</strong> Currently training is carried out through cascade training models (eg one person trains 10 people, they in turn train 10 people, and so on). It is cost-effective, but often the information ends up at the end of the chain incomplete or inaccurate.</p> <p><strong>Engage traditional healers: </strong>Given that they are a trusted part of the health system from the perspective of service users, healers need to be engaged by governments in promoting appropriate health messages.</p> <h2>Carol Dunn, risk communication specialist, <a href="http://www.2resilience.com" title="">2resilience</a>, Seattle, US, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/caroldn" title="">@caroldn</a></h2> <p><strong>Encourage communication online or over the phone:</strong> Technology can help reduce factors that lead people to leave their house.

http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/20/uk-ebola-emergency-research <p>The international development secretary, Justine Greening, has launched an emergency research initiative to look into spread of Ebola, which has claimed more than 1,200 lives in west Africa.</p><p>The £6.5m programme co-funded by the Wellcome Trust was announced a day after a director of Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) accused western leaders of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/19/western-leaders-ebola-outbreak-africa-medecins-sans-frontieres" title="">taking "almost zero" interest in the crisis</a> in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p><p>Greening said she hoped the research would "better equip those working on the ground so they can tackle the outbreak as effectively as possible".</p><p>Val Snewin, international activities manager at Wellcome Trust, said: "There's an urgency to this. We are not an emergency team, but what we can do is mobilise research. Unless someone is willing to commit to research you cannot learn to improve things either later in this outbreak or the next one."</p><p>The Department for International Development and the trust hope to have research commissioned and completed within two months, meaning it could have an impact on the current crisis, which is expected to last more than six months.</p><p>Among the projects they may look at are case detection systems in places such as Sierra Leone and Liberia where there is illiteracy and weak health infrastructure and where accurate data on the spread of the disease is difficult to come by. Snewin said they would also be prepared to fund clinical trials for prototype diagnostic&nbsp;tools.</p><p>This week the World Food Programme announced it was stepping up emergency food deliveries after reports of shortages in quarantined areas.</p><p>MSF has called for international leadership and resources to tackle Ebola. The UK's Disaster Emergency Committee has said it would support a transnational intervention if asked.</p><p>A DEC spokesman, responding to MSF's plea, said: "A regional monitoring and tracing programme would require leadership from national governments in the affected countries, probably with the support of the UN agencies. Were such a programme initiated, many DEC members might well be in a position to support it."</p><p>On Wednesday , police in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, fired teargas to disperse a crowd agitating to leave a neighbourhood placed under quarantine because of Ebola, witnesses said.</p><p>Liberia has the highest death toll of the four west African countries affected by the disease, with the fastest-rising number of cases. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf ordered the quarantine and imposed a night-time curfew that began&nbsp;on Wednesday.</p><p>Snewin said a committee of experts was in place for the initiative, drawing on the UN, WHO and academia, who could approve research proposals. Among the areas that interest Wellcome are treatment-seeking behaviour, case detection systems and clinical management.</p><p>"What are the social reasons for seeking treatment? In some areas there is distrust of western medical centres and that then fuels potential transmission," she said. "WHO has various guidelines and practices that it feels are necessary to manage the crisis, are these working? Are these the best practices? Can we learn now and amend these practices?"</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/20/ebola-western-hysteria-health-workers-risking-lives <p>Last Friday, I spoke to my mother at her home in Freetown, Sierra Leone, to discuss my forthcoming trip. In light of the outbreak of Ebola in the country, should I still come? She thought I should reschedule – the mood in the country was low and people were staying home. Best wait for a better time. What we didn’t discuss was the chance of me catching Ebola, because we both knew the chances were minuscule.</p> <p>Our conversation may yet be entirely academic because British Airways, on which I am booked to fly, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28663833" title="">has cancelled all flights until the end of this month</a> and possibly beyond. The World Health Organisation gave the company a very public slap, issuing a statement to say there was no need to suspend flights as the disease was not airborne, and anyone in the infectious stages of Ebola would be incapable of flying. “<a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/499837549763121152" title="">Hard to save lives if we &amp; other health workers cannot get in</a>,” the WHO tweeted.</p> <p>Sadly, that didn’t stop other airlines following suit. Kenya Airways suspended flights to Freetown, and Korean Airlines suspended flights to Nairobi, even though Kenya is on the other side of the continent, 3,000 miles away. This week, a Brazilian delegation to a trade conference in Namibia cancelled its visit, citing fear of Ebola. “Do these people not have a map?” a spokesman for Namibia’s Chamber of Commerce asked. The Namibian capital, Windhoek, is closer to Rio de Janeiro than to Guinea, where the outbreak originated.</p> <p>Western reporting of the Ebola outbreak has been consistently overblown. Early reports claimed the virus was passed on to humans through the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26735118" title="">consumption of fruit bats</a>, an apparent delicacy of which I’d never heard. In a scientific paper I found a more convincing explanation: the bats hang in the rafters of buildings, dropping their <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/virus/filo/bats.html" title="">contaminated feces and urine</a> below. A friend in Freetown tells me of the greeting that has replaced the customary three kisses: people knock elbows and chant “Elbow, elbow-la!”.On the phone, my mother is pleased people are heeding government advice. This week, the New York Times reported <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/26/world/they-had-ebola-and-lived-to-tell-about-it.html" title="">Ebola survivors being shunne</a>d and treated as “untouchable” by neighbours. Much, in fact, as people in America refused to touch HIV-positive people a few decades back, only with better reason.</p> <p>In the US, Donald Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/495415298808639488" title="">tweeted that American Ebola victims should not be brought home</a>. Yet international health experts agree that the failure to contain the outbreak is due to the broken health systems in the affected countries, which are among the poorest in the world, two of which are still rebuilding following a decade of war. Simply put, this would not happen in Britain or the US.</p> <p>In west Africa, those most at risk are the very poor, their carers and health workers. True, the disease has no cure, but reported death rates of 90% are wrong. The actual figure is 50%-55%. Agencies struggling to contain the outbreak took the international media to task for reporting an inflated figure, causing locals to view Ebola centres as no more than a place to die and therefore refuse to report symptoms.</p> <p>The US has begun evacuating its citizens from the area. Meanwhile, another friend, who heads an NGO in Freetown and has no plans to evacuate her staff, describes the courage of the doctors and nurses working 20-hour shifts, despite the loss of nearly 100 colleagues.</p> <p>Some years ago I met the Sierra Leonian expert in haemorrhagic fevers, Dr Aniru Conteh, who headed the country’s Lassa fever research unit. He had struggled on with his work for years despite a lack of proper equipment – reportedly at one point using a snorkel and mask while handling samples. He died after being accidentally contaminated by a patient.</p> <p>His successor, Dr Sheik Umar Khan, spearheaded initial efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak. He too died in the line of duty, as did most members of his unit: researchers, nurses and even a driver. Their loss will have enduring consequences in the world’s fight against the disease, yet their life’s work has received less coverage than an idiotic remark by Trump. Read reports in the western media of Ebola hysteria and you may well ask yourself to whom the hysteria belongs. Not, apparently, to those with the most to lose.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/19/western-leaders-ebola-outbreak-africa-medecins-sans-frontieres <p>The international community has made "almost zero" response to the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, with western leaders more interested in protecting their own countries than helping contain the crisis that has now claimed more than 1,200 lives, a senior international aid worker said on Tuesday.</p><p>Brice de la Vigne, the operations director of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said politicians in industrialised countries urgently needed to take action, or risk the outbreak spreading much further. "Globally, the response of the international community is almost zero," he told the Guardian. "Leaders in the west are talking about their own safety and doing things like closing airlines – and not helping anyone else."</p><p>His comments came as the World Health Organisation announced that the death toll in the world's worst Ebola outbreak has now exceeded 1,200. The haemorrhagic disease, which kills up to 90% of those infected, is ravaging Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and also has a toehold in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy.</p><p>De la Vigne, who has just returned from a tour of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, said the scale of the outbreak was comparable to a catastrophe such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake, which killed 300,000 people.</p><p>"The solution is not that complicated but we need to have political will to do so. Time is running against us. But you need very senior people with high profiles, the kind of people who can co-ordinate a response to a million people affected by an earthquake," he said.</p><p>His words were echoed by Dr Gabriel Fitzpatrick, who is working at the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/jul/17/ebola-sierra-leone-epidemic" title="">MSF field hospital in Kailahun</a>, the epicentre of the crisis in Sierra Leone.</p><p>"If this Ebola outbreak happened in a western community, in London, you'd get a few cases and that would be it," he said. "The main objective here is not to dramatically increase the person's chance of survival, it's to contain the spread"</p><p>At least 810 cases of Ebola have been reported in Sierra Leone, and 348 people have died from the virus in the country, according to World Health Organisation figures. Since June  Fitzpatrick has been working in the MSF field hospital, processing patients through three stages with a "suspect tent", a "probably tent" and a "confirmed tent". Once in the final tent, their chances of coming out alive are slim.</p><p>He described one family of nine wiped out after a grandmother contracted the disease on August 4. Death is swift – usually within four or five days.</p><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/-sp-ebola-out-of-control-west-africa" title="">Fear, rumours and conspiracy theories have conspired with poverty and high illiteracy</a> to allow the disease to flourish in two countries whose infrastructure is already weak. "Both Sierra Leone and Liberia were at war 10 years ago and all the infrastructure was destroyed. It's the worst place on earth to have these epidemics," De la Vigne said.</p><p>Sierra Leone and Liberia have already declared a state of emergency, but health provision is reaching breaking point.</p><p>Sinead Walsh, who is working on the Sierra Leonean presidential Ebola task force, said the crisis was already causing deeper problems. She said more than 1 million people are in quarantine in Kailahun and neighbouring Kenema alone, businesses are closing, farmers are unable to trade and fears are rising about food shortages.</p><p>The disease is having a knock-on effect, with sick people afraid to go to hospital for fear of catching Ebola. Health workers fear deaths from malaria and in childbirth could now also escalate.</p><p>"We are gone beyond the stage of a health crisis. This is a humanitarian emergency now." said Walsh, Ireland's ambassador to the country and head of Irish Aid in Freetown. "We need to start working on the secondary crisis."</p><p>Fitzpatrick said the priority was to contain the disease, using local volunteers to find suspected cases and bring patients to hospitals where they can be isolated: "The second thing is to trace those who we know have been in contact and  keep them under observation. We are not doing any contact tracing at the moment," he said. "It's not rocket science to do on a large scale across west Africa. But it needs an organisational structure and good leadership." David Heymann, professor of infections disease epidemiology at the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine, who headed the global response to SARS while working for WHO said that oubtreak took three months to contain.</p><p>He also said containing ebola was "not rocket science" identifying "contact tracing" and public communications as the key factors.</p><p>One of the differences with SARS is the outbreak happened in industrialised countries where systems for "infection control" were in place, he said.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/17/ebola-kenya-bans-travel-west-africa-virus-fears <p>The World Health Organisation has urged governments not to impose blanket bans on trade and travel on Ebola-affected countries after Kenya joined a growing number of countries and airlines severing links to three west African states.</p><p>The WHO has already said that the <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2014/ebola-travel/en/" title="">risk of Ebola transmission from air travel is low</a>, but the level of fear is so high that several airlines have disregarded the UN agency's advice. The disease has already killed at least 1,145 people across west Africa this year.</p><p>"The scale of the outbreak is much larger than anything ever seen before," said Gregory Hartl, a WHO spokesman. "It is an obvious source of concern and it is not to be underestimated, but we must take measures commensurate with the risk. What you don't want to do is to take blanket measures to cut off travel and trade."</p><p>Despite such advice, Kenya is the latest country to jump on the bandwagon by declaring a travel ban on Saturday. From midnight on Tuesday, people travelling from or through Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia will not be allowed to enter the east African country, said Kenya's health ministry.</p><p>Nigeria, which allows entry to health professionals and Kenyans returning from those countries, was not included in the ban. The outbreak began in the forested zone on the borders of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia earlier this year, and spread to Nigeria last month.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-444767269'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/17/1408301523250/EbolaTravelBansWEB2.png' alt='Ebola Travel Bans WEB2' width='460' height='525' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The WHO last week said the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/15/ebola-outbreak-vastly-underestimated-world-health-organisation" title="">outbreak had been vastly underestimated</a> and will require "extraordinary measures, on a massive scale" to contain it. Médecins sans Frontières, the medical charity, said the disease was spreading "faster than we can respond to", and accused the WHO of being too slow to react.</p><p>Following the Kenyan government's decision, Kenya Airways said it would suspend flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone, abruptly reversing its announcement on Friday that it would continue flying to those countries. The airline had been accused by medical experts and Kenyan politicians of putting profits ahead of prudence amid fears that its flights would spread the virus. The airline flies more than 70 flights a week to west Africa.</p><p>The airline's chief executive, Titus Naikuni, had argued at a news conference on Friday that its flights actually helped to contain the Ebola outbreak by transporting medical staff, supplies and equipment to west Africa. But doctors representing the Kenya Medical Association had asked Kenya Airways to suspend flights to the four countries affected by Ebola "until things stabilise". MPs also called on the carrier to halt its west African operations.</p><p>Several airlines have already suspended flights to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, including British Airways, Emirates Airlines, Arik Air and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-28550906" title="">ASKY Airlines</a>. Nigeria became the fourth Ebola-affected country after a Liberian-American man <a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/165732-ncaa-suspends-asky-airline-for-flying-ebola-virus-victim-into-nigeria.html#sthash.l5Q1R24D.dpbs" title="">flew to Lagos on an ASKY flight</a> and infected several people in the city before he died.</p><p>Officials in Cameroon, which borders Nigeria, announced on Friday it would suspend all flights from all four Ebola-affected countries. Korean Air announced on Thursday it would temporarily halt its service to Kenya despite there being no cases of Ebola in the country.</p><p>Nigeria has withdrawn its athletes from the Youth Olympics in Nanjing, China, as a result of the outbreak; the games opened on Saturday. The International Olympic Committee has barred athletes from Ebola-hit countries from competing in pool events and combat sports, affecting three athletes.</p><p>Hartl said action commensurate with the risk of Ebola spreading through air travel has already been taken in the three most-affected countries: the screening of passengers.</p><p>"We know it's happening. It makes sense at the departure end and there is nothing to stop screening at the incoming end. These are much better measures. You do not need a sledgehammer to crack a nut."</p><p>Screening involves visual observations and asking passengers questions such as whether they have had known contact with Ebola cases and whether they feel ill or feverish. No one has been stopped from travelling since the screenings were introduced, said Hartl, who pointed out that the Liberian-American who died in quarantine in Lagos had left before screening was in place. But screening in his case might not have worked as he had left with no symptoms, and only reported feeling unwell on arrival in Lagos.</p><p>Ebola-affected countries are suffering economically as international airlines restrict flights, companies scale down regional operations and commercial trade is put on hold, <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/video/2014/07/25/ebola-tackling-the-outbreak-in-west-africa" title="">said the World Bank</a>. The bank, along with the International Monetary Fund, reduced this year's economic growth estimate for Guinea to 3.5%, down from their original projection of 4.5% growth.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/15/ebola-outbreak-vastly-underestimated-world-health-organisation <p>The magnitude of the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, which has killed more than 1,000 people, has been vastly underestimated and will require “extraordinary measures, on a massive scale” if it is to be contained, the <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/overview-20140814/en/">World Health Organisation</a> has warned.</p> <p>The admission came as <a href="http://www.msf.org/">Médecins sans Frontières (MSF), the medical charity, </a> said the disease was spreading “faster than we can respond to”, and accused the WHO of being too slow to react.</p> <p>The outbreak, which is the worst to date, <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_08_13_ebola/en/">has killed 1,069 people</a>, with 1,975 cases recorded in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. However, the WHO fears the figures are unreliable.</p> <p>“Staff at the outbreak sites see evidence that the numbers of reported cases and deaths vastly underestimate the magnitude of the outbreak,” it said.</p> <p>“WHO is coordinating a massive scaling up of the international response, marshalling support from individual countries, disease control agencies, agencies within the UN system, and others.”</p> <p>It was using “practical, on-the-ground” intelligence to map the outbreak, pinpoint the areas of ongoing transmission, and decide where health workers and new isolation facilities were most needed.</p> <p>The WHO said the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention</a> were equipping the hardest-hit countries with technology to enable real-time reporting of cases and analysis of trends.</p> <p>Efforts are under way <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/15/ebola-emergency-food-drops-liberia-sierra-leone">to help those trapped in quarantined areas</a>, with the World Food Programme seeking to deliver food to more than 1 million people trapped on the borders of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Such steps, said the WHO, had been taken in “recognition of the extraordinary measures needed, on a massive scale, to contain the outbreak in settings characterised by extreme poverty, dysfunctional health systems, a severe shortage of doctors and rampant fear”.</p> <p>Ernest Bai Koroma, Sierra Leone’s president, painted a stark picture of the outbreak in the country with the highest death toll, admitting that the government’s initial response had been too slow but saying more help could have come from countries with greater resources and expertise.</p> <p>After observing a minute’s silence in memory of those who died, a sombre-looking president said:“I wasn’t happy with the response because we have all been slow, and this is a crisis that requires quick action in terms of response. What we can do as a government, I believe we have done. We look forward to the international community to increase their response.”</p> <p>“This is a call we’re now making to the world because we need treatment centres. And in the treatment centres, we need clinicians that require specialised training. We don’t have that. And if people are dying the response should be an extraordinary response. We must limit bureaucracy.”</p> <p>Sierra Leone had received less than $2m in direct international funding, Koroma said, although millions more had been channelled through aid organisations.</p> <p>MSF, which warned <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/23/west-africa-ebola-epidemic-out-of-control">almost a month ago that the outbreak was already “out of control”</a>, issued a bleak assessment of the situation on Friday.</p> <p>“It is deteriorating faster – and moving faster – than we can respond to,” said Joanne Liu, MSF international president. “It is like wartime.”</p> <p>Speaking at a press conference in Geneva, Liu criticised the WHO for not declaring the outbreak <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2014/aug/08/who-ebola-outbreak-international-public-health-emergency-video">an international public health emergency until 8 August</a>, adding: “I think the wake-up call was too late”.</p> <p>Now that a common understanding had been reached, she said, the world needed to see concrete action in the field.</p> <p>“If we don’t stabilise Liberia, we will never stabilise the region,” she told Reuters. “Over the next six months we should get the upper hand on the epidemic; this is my gut feeling.”</p> <p>Liu’s warning was echoed by Dr Unni Krishnan, Plan International’s head of disaster preparedness and response, who said a decisive moment had been reached in the battle against the disease.</p> <p>“Time is running out fast and millions of lives are at stake,” he said. “Turning the tide of this deadly disease is now the collective responsibility of the world.”</p> <p>The best way to deal with the outbreak and prepare for future ones, Krishnan added, was to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/aug/13/ebola-epidemic-poor-facilities-distrust-healthcare">invest in public health systems</a> and improve the care of infected people.</p> <p>Although <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/14/us-health-ebola-koreanairlines-idUSKBN0GE0L320140814">some airlines have suspended flights to parts of west Africa</a>, the WHO has stressed that the danger posed to air travellers remains low.</p> <p>“Unlike infections such as influenza or tuberculosis, Ebola is not airborne,” said Dr Isabelle Nuttall, WHO’s director of global capacity alert and response. “It can only be transmitted by direct contact with the body fluids of a person who is sick with the disease.”</p> <p>Nuttall said the risk of Ebola transmission on flights was so low that the WHO did not consider airports to be a particular danger.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 19 August 2014. An earlier version said that Sierra Leone “has no labs capable of testing for the virus”. In fact there are currently two testing facilities, a mobile lab in Kailahun run by MSF and a centre in Kenema supported by Metabiota and the Sierra Leone government.<br /></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/15/mining-ebola-africa-nigeria-liberia-guinea-riotinto-vale <p>Rich in raw materials, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa/roundup">the major countries that have been hit by the outbreak</a> - Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria - are all <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/mining">heavily dependent on mining</a>. Globally recognized firms Rio Tinto and Vale, as well as smaller companies such as Sierra Rutile and London Mining, have been forced to act since the outbreak, which has killed more than 1,000 people since it began in March.<br /></p> <p>The responses of these international companies have varied. Some are attempting to help contain the crisis; others have withdrawn their international employees from the region. The majority are providing financial donations and have increased sanitation to workers to help tackle the disease. For example, Rio Tinto, the world’s third largest mining company, who owns a share of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/19/rio-tinto-20bn-deal-iron-ore-deposit">Simandou</a> project in eastern Guinea, has donated $100,000 to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) work in the area and is making additional sanitation supplies and equipment available to “the communities in which staff live and work”.</p> <p>By contrast, the world’s biggest iron ore producer, Vale, who was involved in the Simandou project until late April, was reported to have <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/04/07/ebola-virus-brings-mining-to-a-halt-in-west-africa.aspx">evacuated six international members of staff</a> and put the rest of its workforce in the area on leave. There has been no information released on whether the company helped to contain the virus. Vale declined requests from the Guardian to confirm reports or explain their response to the outbreak.</p> <p>Smaller firms, however, such as London Mining and Sierra Rutile, who operate in Sierra Leone, have also donated money in efforts to tackle the spread of the disease, much of which will be used to educate local communities about the virus. This is the biggest challenge in the fight against the outbreak, says WHO spokesperson Gregory Hartl. Because of this, more companies operating in affected countries are being called on to educate local communities and their workforces. “Any company or organisation who can help spread proper education about Ebola and how one can protect themselves and others, that we need,” says Hartl. </p> <p>But are the actions of these international mining companies helping communities deal with the<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/health"> health </a>crisis, or do these measures primarily function to protect operations and enhance reputations? “The first thing to be aware of is this is a response to an emergency that can impact their business,” says Professor Bobby Banerjee, who carries out research in the areas of sustainability, climate change and corporate social responsibility at London’s Cass Business School. </p> <p>“The extractive industry’s response to a crisis is often to protect assets so that mining continues without any impact and then greenwash your way through the issue,” Banerjee says. These actions, such as providing donations and sanitation to workers, deflects attention from some of the social, cultural and environmental impacts of their operations. </p> <p>But in a rush to protect their assets, mining companies can contribute to an already bad situation. The World Food Programme (WFP), in April, said the state of higher vulnerability in Guinea, due to the epidemic, has been worsened by “suspension of activities and/or withdrawal of several large mining companies”. This has led to unemployment and loss of income to access food resources, says the WFP. Banerjee says the mining industry is certainly not the only one to hold accountable for these issues: “The fact that poverty is a major cause of this virus means industry and governments are equally accountable. It is an easily solvable problem, yet the state and the market have both failed.” </p> <p>International organisations are now stepping up their role. Earlier this week, the WHO announced that offering unproven treatments would be an option for treatment or prevention, throwing further debate on how to deal with the crisis ethically.</p> <p>The severity of the outbreak also forced US president Barack Obama to address the situation at the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFl1GsKWg7A">US-Africa leaders summit, held in Washington DC earlier this month</a>. “The United States and our international partners will continue to do whatever we can to help our African partners respond to this crisis with the people of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone,” the president said. “In their histories they have overcome great challenges and they are drawing on that same strength and resilience today.” </p> <p>And like international governments, industries’ response to the epidemic has been under the watchful eye of NGOs and the public. Plan International says that rich nations and emerging economies must be generous and deploy all possible resources to accelerate the fight against Ebola. The response has been massively underfunded, it says. </p> <p>Banerjee says that a crisis like this highlights the mining industry’s responsibility to look beyond its environmental impact and consider how to address issues such as the equitable distribution of resources and health care. </p> <p>To establish this, one has to look at corporate social responsibility over the years and decipher what the mining industry’s contribution to basic health and sanitisation issues outside of their plants and operations are. The trends show that there has been an obsession with “supply-side CSR”, which is about managing reputation and the financial benefits without much consider for how effective it might be: “It’s obvious that this is about, firstly, making sure operations continue and employees and contractors are safe and able to work, and most importantly to come out of the issue with reputations enhanced.”</p> <p>Rio Tinto’s $100,000 donation to help contain the spread of the virus has not been part of a more comprehensive long-term plan. Banerjee speculates that this is due to a lack of consideration for the outcome.</p> <p>“The Ebola health crisis is actually a good opportunity for the mining companies, given the criticism they have taken over the years, to show how much good they can do,” says Banerjee. “But often, two years later, it’s business-as-usual.”</p> <p><em>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/social-impact">social impact</a> hub is funded by Anglo American.

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/15/ebola-emergency-food-drops-liberia-sierra-leone <p>International agencies are considering emergency food drops and truck convoys to reach extremely hungry people in Liberia and Sierra Leone, who are cordoned off from the outside world to halt the spread of the Ebola virus, a World Bank official said on Thursday.</p> <p>Hunger is spreading fast as farmers die leaving crops rotting in fields. Truckers scared of the highly infectious disease are halting deliveries and shops are closing. Major airlines have shut down routes, isolating large swaths of the countries.</p> <p>The Mano river region, home to about 1 million people and an epicentre for the disease, is a major concern and the issue was raised on Wednesday with the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said Tim Evans, senior director for health at the World Bank.</p> <p>“There has been a lot of inflation in food prices and a lot of difficulty in getting food to the quarantined population,” he added.</p> <p>The World Bank, with the UN and the World Health Organisation (WHO), is urgently assessing how to make emergency food deliveries, or the organisations face the danger of a deepening health crisis from malnutrition and the spread of other diseases, he said.</p> <p>“This is emerging as an important part of the immediate response,” Evans said. “We are looking at exactly what the needs are and where, and then looking at how we contribute to making sure that food gets to the right places.”</p> <p>The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) said it has declared Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – the three countries with more than 1,000 deaths in total from Ebola – a level three food emergency, its highest threat. It is mobilising teams to get food into the area to prevent widespread hunger and deaths.</p> <p>“We are pulling out all the stops,” said Steve Taravella, WFP spokesman in Washington.</p> <p>His agency is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/13/gaza-ebola-iraq-approaching-disaster-overload" title="">extraordinarily stretched</a>. Never before has it faced six top-level emergencies at once – in Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, Cameroon, Central African Republic and now the Ebola-hit countries. “It is a dramatic, profound situation,” he said.</p> <p>For west Africa, the stability of the whole region is at stake if hunger and disease spread uncontrolled, Evans said. “It certainly is a threat to national security,” he added, stressing that a comprehensive response is needed.</p> <p>But for Nigeria, the World Bank director expressed optimism <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/ebola-nigerian-capital" title="">that it has acted promptly to contain Ebola</a> by reaching those who came into contact with its first victim there. “It suggests at this point that it is relatively contained,” he said.</p> <p>Longer term, the Ebola outbreak has exposed the danger from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/aug/13/ebola-epidemic-poor-facilities-distrust-healthcare" title="">chronic underfunding of national healthcare systems</a> and the need to invest in regional laboratories <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/14/ebola-epidemic-research-ethics" title="">to test and manage infectious diseases</a>, he said.</p> <p>Most African countries have fallen far short of a 2000 pledge, known as the <a href="http://www.who.int/healthsystems/publications/abuja_declaration/en/" title="">Abuja declaration</a>, to devote 15% of their budgets to healthcare. The World Bank “absolutely” expects more lending for health in the years ahead, Evans said.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/15/ebola-vaccine-outbreak-secret-serum <p>As Nigeria becomes <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/ebola-nigerian-capital">the fourth west African country fighting to contain Ebola</a>, Professor Eleanor Riley from the <a href="http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/">London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a> explains the latest medical science for preventing and treating the disease.</p><p><strong>Why hasn't an Ebola vaccine been developed so far? </strong></p><p>Ebola, which has occasional small, often easily contained, outbreaks, is never going to be a high priority for the World Health Organisation (WHO) or donors. They aren't going to vaccinate everybody at birth against the disease because of the amount of effort and resource you would have to put in to save a small number of lives.</p><p><strong>Is that still true after this outbreak?</strong></p><p>Yes and no. This is the biggest outbreak by far. We've known about Ebola since the 1970s and most outbreaks have been very well controlled. This one is unusual. Somebody took their eye off the ball and maybe that won't happen again, we don't know. But I think this has been a real learning point for public health.</p><p>It takes two or three weeks after vaccination for your immune response to get to a protective level. So it's not as if you can go into a village where there's been an outbreak, vaccinate everyone and they're protected. Once you've got an outbreak, vaccination isn't necessarily much help.</p><p><strong>What about </strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/11010893/Secret-serum-could-save-American-Ebola-victims-as-second-man-in-Lagos-falls-ill.html" title=""><strong>the 'secret serum' that was given to two American doctors</strong></a><strong>? What is it and could it contain the outbreak?</strong></p><p>This drug gives you antibodies directly, rather than waiting two to three weeks after vaccination for the antibodies to work. It could be used for treatment whereas a vaccine is more likely to be used for prevention.</p><p><strong>Why wasn't <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/12/ebola-liberia-says-experimental-drug-on-the-way-from-us">more of the serum</a> available? </strong></p><p>It's a question of whether there is a market for this. Who is going to pay for it? How much do you actually need? It hasn't been through clinical trials yet, but if it's found to work it would be great to have a stockpile of this available to treat people who get Ebola. It's very expensive at the moment. But with most of these things, if you can make a lot of it then it tends to get cheaper. But the initial investment to develop and test in clinical trials is expensive.</p><p>By the sound of it there's not enough of it available to make a difference with this particular outbreak. But if they can give it to a few people and show that it really helps, they will presumably be able to raise more money to make more of it in the future.</p><p><strong>What do you think about </strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-28767695" title=""><strong>Canada's decision to send in doses</strong></a><strong> of an untested vaccine?</strong></p><p>It depends what they mean by untested. The vaccine that has been made in Canada has been tested on monkeys and seems to have some protective value. If I was about to go to west Africa to treat patients with Ebola I would probably take that vaccine. It might not work but it's unlikely to do me any harm. It might well save my life.</p><p><strong>Is the untested vaccine dangerous?</strong></p><p>We have no data about the hazard of the vaccine itself, but we have no evidence to say that it's dangerous. At this particular stage the cost benefit definitely lies with giving the vaccine. If we give to people and several of them start to develop unpleasant side effects, we would have to stop. But those side effects would need to be quite serious.</p><p><strong>What is the effect of the outbreak on vaccine development?</strong></p><p>In the end, we might be a lot further on with a vaccine than we would have been without one. Nobody wanted an Ebola outbreak in order to speed up development, but that might be the silver lining.</p><p><strong>Read more stories like this: </strong></p><p>• <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/apr/10/best-bits-funding-drug-development-diseases-poverty">15 ways to fund drugs for diseases of poverty</a></p><p>• <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/14/ebola-epidemic-guinea-sierra-leone-liberia-msf-world-health-organisation">Ebola: voices from the epicentre of the epidemic</a></p><p>• <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/mar/10/hiv-treatments-gene-vaccine-global-development" title="">Preventing HIV: the latest on vaccine development and gene therapy</a></p><p><strong>Join the community of global development professionals and experts. </strong><a href="https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/" title=""><strong>Become a GDPN member</strong></a><strong> to get more stories like this direct to your inbox</strong></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/14/ebola-epidemic-research-ethics <p>“Um… have you seen <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/outbreak" title="">Outbreak</a>?”</p> <p>This is what a very smart doctor friend of mine posted to my Facebook wall yesterday. She was referencing the medical disaster film about a deadly virus during a discussion about the ethics of using experimental treatments for Ebola victims. She was exaggerating for effect, of course, but she was making a very serious point. When the alternative is pretty much a gruesome death, why on earth not permit the use of unproven and untested treatments?</p> <p>As it turns out, I agree with her. It would be unethical not to. The only way to find out if these treatments really work is to test them in this epidemic. However, it would also be wrong to think that, terrifying as they may seem, epidemics like Ebola mean that research ethics go out of the window. In fact, as the World Health Organisation <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ebola-ethical-review-summary/en/" title="">recognised in a statement on Tuesday</a>, ethics has to be at the heart of research into experimental interventions – ethical criteria must guide the provision of such interventions. These include transparency about all aspects of care, informed consent, freedom of choice, confidentiality, respect for the person, preservation of dignity and involvement of the community.</p> <p>Despite appearances, the point of ethics isn’t to slow research down, or to tie researchers and aid workers up in bureaucratic knots while they try to cope with deadly diseases. The point of ethics is to ensure the safety of participants and the soundness of the research. Now, worrying about the safety of participants during an epidemic that has no cure may seem perverse, but considering that Ebola is not, in fact, 100% fatal (mortality rates vary from 50%-90% depending on the strain) means that the seemingly compassionate distribution of experimental therapies could do more harm than good. Remember: we don’t know if they work. Which is why those who participate must be free to do so and fully aware of the risks.</p> <p>Decades ago, HIV/Aids activists campaigned successfully for access to experimental treatments on the grounds that the alternative was, for them, death. Yet it was not just a “do or die” calculus that gave their claim moral weight – they were a well-informed patient population, freely entering into research. They understood the risks; they were not coerced. Rather, they eventually became partners in the research enterprise (shaking that enterprise out of some outdated assumptions while they were at it).</p> <p>For the provision of experimental treatments in the Ebola epidemic to be ethical, it must be ensured that the communities receiving those treatments are also able freely to enter into a transparent and fair research partnership. This is why the WHO statement should be seen as just the beginning of a wider, global discussion that must include multiple voices from the affected nations in Africa. They must be free to decide how this would work out in their cities and villages.</p> <p>But why bother about transparency, freedom and fairness when there are lives at stake? In short, because it saves lives. The history of medical research in Africa is littered with horrific examples of western science running roughshod over the rights and liberties of local peoples. This colonial legacy can manifest in an understandable and quite justified culture of uncertainty and mistrust around the objectives of western researchers, despite their best intentions. When communities in which research is done feel that scientific agendas are being imposed upon them by outside powers, that legacy is exacerbated. This can only make it more difficult to do the good, reliable science we need to combat epidemics.</p> <p>Actually finding out whether the experimental treatments for Ebola and other epidemics work is only possible if affected communities believe that their interests and values are respected. This only happens when researchers act ethically. Imagine an outbreak of Ebola in Birmingham, say, and the EU pitching and running experiments without consulting with the city council, or failing to share the results of the experiments, and you begin to see how things might go wrong when you ignore people’s freedoms and rights.</p> <p>This is why, during epidemics, it is essential that ethical criteria guide the provision of any experimental treatments. It’s not just the right thing to do morally, it’s the right thing to do scientifically. We all want this research to get done – it would be immoral not to do it. All the more reason to ensure that we do it right.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/csiro-cuts-ebola-research-warns-union <p>CSIRO researchers working on the Ebola virus could be the latest victims of budget cuts, the union has claimed, as Australia’s chief scientist said it was a myth that the country punched above its weight when it came to innovation.<br /></p> <p>Up to eight researchers at Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong could lose their jobs, according to the CSIRO staff association, which quoted a letter from management to staff saying there would be “a planned reduction in microbiology and virology expertise”.</p> <p>Research into bowel or colorectal cancer as well research into Alzheimer’s, dementia and other areas of neuroscience would cease, according to the staff association, which said there would be 40 redundancies across the two research areas.</p> <p>Scientists at AAHL have been researching the Ebola virus, which is having its largest outbreak, since the lab obtained a sample last year. The CSIRO staff association said AAHL was critical in protecting Australia from bird flu, Sars and the Hendra virus.</p> <p> “AAHL has a world-class reputation for research into zoonotic diseases; viruses that can be passed from animals to humans. This is terrible news for hard-working researchers who are dedicated to keeping Australians, indeed the world’s population, safe from illness,” CSIRO staff association secretary Sam Popovski said. </p> <p>The AAHL hosted a forum last week bringing together researchers in animal and human infectious diseases from different institutions.</p> <p>CSIRO issued <a href="http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/New-collaborations-seek-to-solve-infectious-disease-challenges.aspx">a media release</a> quoting the chief executive of the National Health and Medical Research Council on the importance of infectious disease research.</p> <p>“More than 70 per cent of new and emerging infectious diseases originate in animals, so there are great benefits to merging the collective genius from both sides to address some of the nation’s greatest infectious disease challenges,” Warwick Anderson said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Australia’s chief scientist, professor Ian Chubb, said the nation was not punching above its weight when it came to science innovation and there needed to be better targeted investment and strategies.</p> <p>“Bluntly, we are middle-of-the-road. Not better, not punching above our weight as we so often declare in a fit of misguided and unhelpful enthusiasm,” he said at <a href="http://www.chiefscientist.gov.au/2014/08/speech-2014-jack-beale-lecture-at-unsw/">the 2014 Jack Beale lecture at the University of New South Wales</a> on Wednesday night.</p> <p>“I think it is no coincidence that we sit where we do. Australia is now the only OECD country that does not have a contemporary national science and technology or innovation strategy.”</p> <p>Chubb cited statistics that showed Australia did well in terms of how many of its research papers made up the world’s top 1% but said patenting rates were poor and links between researchers and businesses were among the worst in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</p> <p>Less than one in three Australian researchers worked in industry; half the OECD average of 60% and substantially less than the US, where about two in three researchers were in the business sector, he said. </p> <p>Just 1.5% of Australian companies developed new innovations in the latest year for which statistics were available, compared to between 10% and 40% in other OECD countries.</p> <p>Chubb referred to federal budget cuts saying while he accepted a future without debt was a good thing, he wanted more.</p> <p>“I want an Australia that is more than just what is left after the economic trimmings work their way through the community’s digestive system,” he said. “I want an Australia in which our economy is organised to support our aspiration and not to limit it.”</p> <p>Chubb said it was important Australia kept in step with the rest of the world when it came to science and ensured the coming generations were bequeathed a planet which could sustain them.</p> <p>He said: “Whether it is our climate, our health, our ageing population, our food supply, our economy or our security, it will be scientific discovery and the use of scientific knowledge that will give us the capacity to respond.”</p> <p>Chubb said there was a lack of coordination in Australia when it came to science investments and policies and the problem was compounded by a shortage of university students choosing to take up science.</p> <p>“It isn’t like a toothbrush: something you can buy when you get there because you forgot to pack one,” he said. “If we are to build both capacity and capability we need strategic investment supported by good planning and long-term commitment.”</p> <p>CSIRO has been contacted for comment.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/aug/14/ebola-polio-hiv-healthcare-foreign-policy <p>There are reasons to be fearful of the Ebola crisis gripping parts of west Africa: death; the risk of contagion; <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/05/us-doctors-ebola-outbreak-patients-fear" title="">overburdened health infrastructure</a>; and concern as neighbouring countries worry about what the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/08/who-ebola-outbreak-international-public-health-emergency" title="">WHO now admits is an international health emergency</a>.</p> <p>These difficulties are exacerbated by the population’s fear not just of the virus itself, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/aug/13/ebola-epidemic-poor-facilities-distrust-healthcare" title="">but also of the health workers there to help</a>.</p> <p>While this fear is primarily related to contagion, there are other, more deeply rooted factors at play. Mistrust of outsiders, particularly western health workers, is bound up in the history of Africa and colonial medicine. When much of the continent was under colonial rule, great powers used these outposts of their empires as laboratories, and Africans as their test subjects.</p> <p>Much work has been done through the years to counter this negative legacy: decentralised health systems, collaborations with local partners, training for African health workers, and partnerships between government, civil society and international donors.</p> <p>The Ebola outbreak underlines how quickly such progress can unravel in times of crisis, and how the legacy of past mistakes by western powers can resurface to speed up that unravelling, to the detriment of health and security locally and globally. Frequently, particularly in the developing world, past failures re-emerge, complicating efforts at crisis management.</p> <p>In this context, recent revelations from Cuba – where it was revealed that the US Agency for International Development (USAid) had used <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/usaid-latin-americans-cuba-rebellion-hiv-workshops" title="">HIV prevention work as a smokescreen for fomenting political opposition</a> – should ignite a debate about the necessity of keeping the work of public health agencies, security services and foreign policy separate. Where they converge, trust is squandered. And, as we are witnessing in west Africa, mistrust in times of emergency hampers the necessary work and efforts of foreign aid workers hugely.</p> <p>The so-called “securitisation” of healthcare is not new. The outbreak of HIV set a precedent as the first health issue to be recognised by the UN security council as an explicit threat to international security. While HIV was a genuine global crisis, there have been recent examples in which foreign policy objectives have been cloaked by apparently innocuous public health activities.</p> <p>In Pakistan, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna" title="">CIA operatives masqueraded as polio vaccinators</a> to gain greater access to Osama bin Laden’s compound. Though the charade fulfilled its security intent, it later resulted in very damaging reversals in local efforts to eradicate the disease. The motive was disguised and trust was spent. Ultimately, the populace – and healthcare workers – suffered.</p> <p>The ability of western governments and agencies to act as emergency providers of healthcare, and as honest brokers, will be increasingly reduced unless we agree that the provision of healthcare should be sacrosanct and protected from motives best realised by other means.</p> <p>The “blue water” between global health and international security continues to narrow, as the UK foreign and commonwealth office encroaches further on the Department for International Development. Meanwhile, the US state department continues to treat USAid as an extension of its operations. Health has traditionally been housed in the international development agencies of western governments. However, as with the role and function of aid and international development, global health is increasingly seen as a part of wider international security strategies for protecting populations from threats such as bioterrorism and infectious diseases such as drug-resistant tuberculosis.</p> <p>Tactical security objectives – however “successful” – should remain separate from international efforts to improve and protect public health. The Ebola crisis has posed incredible difficulties for health workers in west Africa – imagine how difficult it would be to deal with an outbreak where trust was absent at the outset. We are drifting towards a dangerous convergence of health and security policy, one that makes populations less secure and crisis management immeasurably more difficult.</p> <p>•<em> </em><a href="http://www.politics.qmul.ac.uk/staff/harmansophie.html" title=""><em>Dr Sophie Harman</em></a><em> is a senior lecturer in international politics at Queen Mary University of London</em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/ebola-nigerian-capital <p>The man was acting strangely even before he boarded the plane, hunching over in pain and avoiding physical contact with other passengers milling around the airport in Monrovia, Liberia's capital. Once airborne, he was sick several times. By the time he disembarked at Lagos airport – one of the busiest in the continent – he was no longer able to stand unaided, diplomats and a witness told the Guardian.</p><p>Those who rushed forward to help did not know Patrick Sawyer was in the final stages of an <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/ebola" title="">Ebola</a>-induced breakdown, when the deadly disease is at its most contagious. More than 24 hours passed before the Liberian-American civil servant was diagnosed, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/25/first-case-ebola-lagos-nigeria" title="">allowing the virus to gain a toehold in Africa's most populous city</a> and, for the first time, turning the threat of an urban outbreak into a nightmarish possibility.</p><p>After watching <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/soldiers-sierra-leone-liberia-ebola" title="">three regional neighbours - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - battle an eight-monthepidemic</a>, Nigerian officials are scrambling to contain a potential fourth frontline.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-444610003'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407930503041/Ebola-Nigeria-008.jpg' alt='Ebola Nigeria' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Nigerian custom officers wearing face masks and gloves screen passengers arriving at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja this week.

The German government called on its citizens to leave Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone because of the epidemic.</p><p>A colleague travelling alongside Sawyer and a nurse who treated him have both succumbed to Ebola. At least eight others have caught the disease in Lagos, and some 200 are under surveillance.</p><p>"There are some unique challenges that have come up," said John Vertefeuille, leading the US <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/" title="">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) response team in the city. "The population density is a challenge and it's one we're looking at closely in terms how you do contact tracing. What Lagos has as strengths is there's a really talented workforce to draw on."</p><p>Oil giant Nigeria has more resources than most to handle an outbreak but whether the situation spins out of control hinges on the Herculean task of tracing contacts in a crowded, freewheeling city of transients. It took 10 days to trace Sawyer's driver to Port Harcourt, a densely-populated city 600km south of Lagos.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-444610004'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407930402038/Ebola-in-Liberia-008.jpg' alt='Ebola in Liberia' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Liberian nurses carry the body of an Ebola victim from a house for burial in the Banjor Community on the outskirts of Monrovia, Liberia. Photograph: Ahmed Jallanzo/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>The incident has also highlighted a deeper culture of neglect when it comes to infectious tropical diseases that ravage West Africa each year.</p><p>So far, much has come down to chance. As a diplomat, Sawyer, 40, was whisked from the airport by a private driver. The company car – in which he was again sick, according to a Nigerian health official – was taken to a diplomatic compound, and was not used again because it was a national holiday. But public health workers were on strike, so Sawyer was taken to a small family clinic. There, the team who tried to save his life did not initially suspect Ebola, or work with protective gear. At least one other patient at the clinic would later catch Ebola.</p><p>"The family hospital Sawyer went to was caught unawares. If it had been a public hospital, we would have had a much better chance of containing it," said John Oladejo, of Nigeria's Public Health Department, which in April sent dozens of doctors on an Ebola training course.</p><p>Nigeria has one doctor per 2,879 people, compared with one per 10,000 in Guinea or one per 86,275 in Liberia. "We have a window of opportunity at the moment to contain it but there's no room for letting down your guard," said Chikwe Ihekweazu, an epidemiologist who helped stem an Ebola outbreak in Sudan a decade ago. "It's not that we don't have the resources. The challenge is that there are things you have to do religiously every time you're dealing with a patient, and we're just not used to that level of diligence in Nigeria."</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-444610005'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/13/1407930631826/ebola-008.jpg' alt='ebola' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>An Immigration officer checks a passenger's passport at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja.

"I don't shake anyone's hands any more, but I truly have faith it won't spread more. They said you just need to separate the affected people to stop it spreading," he said, as yellow tricycles squeezed past cars, roadside food vendors and men wheeling barrels of water.</p><p>Border controls – which have helped in seven previous Ebola outbreaks – are unlikely to do so in Lagos, whose population ebbs and flows with up to 4,000 new migrants each day. "Ten years ago in Sudan there were no mobile phones, no Twitter. We drove around in Land Rovers with microphones telling people what to do. Today we really need to think about how to communicate with the public so that they know what to do without creating panic and anxiety," said Ihekweazu, who runs the health information site <a href="http://nigeriahealthwatch.com" title="">nigeriahealthwatch.com</a>.</p><p>Another site set up within 24 hours of the first confirmed case, <a href="http://nigeriahealthwatch.com" title="">EbolaFacts.com</a>, received 600,000 hits and 850,000 Facebook views within a week.</p><p>But technology is a double-edged sword. Yahya Balogun woke up to a 4am call last Friday. On the line, his mother demanded he stock up on salt – she had received a text message circulating with the "cure" of a hot salt bath before dawn.</p><p>"Two hours later she called again and asked, 'Yahya, have you done what I asked? Have you sent all your friends the message? This is a terrible disease and you need to pass on the advice'," the taxi driver recounted. The rumour prompted two deaths this week from overdosing on salt water.Public health officials worry fear-mongering will distract from the simple solutions needed to prevent contagion, in scenes reminiscent of some of the scare tactics amid an outbreak of the then little-understood HIV virus in the US during the 1980s. This week an epileptic man reportedly died after residents in Edo state thought his convulsions were a symptom of Ebola and refused to help.</p><p>"We see the fear in people's faces when we're going around door-to-door tracing contacts in the community. You have to explain to each person that there's nothing to be scared of – the likelihood of survival is much higher if you come forward in time," said Oladejo, the public health official.</p><p>"When they ask, what about the Liberian, we tell them: that's exactly what he didn't do; he didn't come forward."</p><p>President Goodluck Jonathan has declared a national emergency, and approved a 1.9bn naira special fund. Despite outbreaks of cholera and Lassa fever – a similarly deadly haemorrhagic fever – that kill tens of thousands annually, the country has no adequate isolation units, so officials rushed through orders for special tents and protective suits essential to prevent contagion.</p><p>Ebola's rarity means it is often overlooked globally too. Fewer than 300 Ebola specialists are stretched thin on the ground in three other nations.</p><p>"I just hope all our work is not in vain," Oladejo said.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/aug/13/ebola-epidemic-poor-facilities-distrust-healthcare <p>In June and July approximately 5,000 women and children in Sierra Leone died of diseases. The vast majority of these <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)60696-6/fulltext" title="">deaths were avoidable</a>. For women and children in Sierra Leone, June and July were just like any other month: unnecessarily dangerous and largely forgotten.</p> <p>The Ebola outbreak in the country killed 233 people during the same period, and the story made <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/08/who-ebola-outbreak-international-public-health-emergency" title="">headlines around the world</a>. Why do the relatively small number of people dying of Ebola occupy the world’s media while the thousands of women and children who die of other illnesses barely get mentioned? Is it an attempt to raise awareness, mobilise resources and halt the epidemic? Or is sensationalism to blame? Children dying in Africa is old news, while an Ebola outbreak sounds like the setting for a Hollywood blockbuster.</p> <p>The people in the global health community, a nebulous conglomerate of UN agencies, NGOs, charities and academic institutes, who spend most of their lives in relative obscurity desperately tying to raise awareness and funds, now appear on news bulletins and in the newspapers. Understandably, the focus of their discourse is the pathophysiology, containment and treatment of the Ebola outbreak. There are the predictable calls for more funding to be allocated to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/malaria-consortium-partner-zone/neglected-tropical-diseases" title="">neglected tropical diseases</a>.</p> <p>The news that US National Institutes of Health is speeding up the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/12/world-health-organisation-allow-unlicensed-ebola-drugs-west-africa" title="">development of an Ebola vaccine</a> has also been well received – as the public seeks a neat solution to a complex problem. In truth, expanded research programmes and vaccines for a rare diseases like Ebola may do nothing to improve the health of poor people.</p> <p>What few commentators are discussing is what unites the well-publicised Ebola victims and the everyday, forgotten deaths. They are all victims of weak healthcare systems, which are distrusted by the people they are designed to help.</p> <p>Unlike influenza, Ebola is not easy to contract. If patients came early to healthcare facilities and were effectively isolated, the epidemic would stop. It is that simple. So why is the Ebola epidemic proving so hard to contain? First, healthcare facilities in Sierra Leone are weak. They often lack the most basic equipment and are chronically understaffed by poorly trained, overworked healthcare personnel.</p> <p>Second, there is widespread distrust of the public healthcare system. The reasons for this distrust are complex. The media are fond of reporting cultural beliefs about the etiology and treatment of disease. While these beliefs are important, so too is the inability of communities to hold their healthcare system to account. It is no surprise that few people trust a heavily centralised healthcare system with poor governance and minimal transparency about how millions of donor dollars are spent.</p> <p>The millions of dollars poured into <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/global-fund-to-fight-aids-tuberculosis-and-malaria" title="">programmes to tackle HIV, malaria and tuberculosis</a> have done little to tackle the weaknesses described above, and to prepare Sierra Leone for the Ebola outbreak. Once the Ebola crisis passes, it will be tempting to revert to simplistic interventions with easy metrics.</p> <p>Counting the numbers of mosquito nets distributed or number of children vaccinated is an easy but inadequate response to the unmet healthcare needs of people in Sierra Leone. If the promised malaria vaccine appeals more to donors than the laborious process of training doctors, nurses and other professionals, the healthcare system will never improve. It is also crucial to engage with governments to improve governance, decentralise and ensure local accountability.</p> <p>Sierra Leone is not unique, and the challenges described here apply to many other countries. Let us hope Sierra Leone never has to tackle another Ebola outbreak. But it would be foolish to assume that the future does not hold similar challenges, be those infectious disease epidemics or a surge in the burden of non-communicable diseases. There is one lesson we should learn from the Ebola outbreak: protecting the health of the poor requires an effective and accountable healthcare system.</p> <p><em>• Matthew Clark is director of </em><a href="http://welbodipartnership.org/" title=""><em>The Welbodi Partnership</em></a><em>, a UK charity working in Sierra Leone</em></p>

Miguel Pajares, a 75-year-old priest, was evacuated to Spain and was due to be given the experimental drug ZMapp at Madrid's Carlos III hospital. A spokesman could not confirm whether the treatment had gone ahead or not before Pajares died.</p><p>Liberia has become the first African country to announce that it will use the drug. It plans to give it to two doctors who have tested positive for Ebola. There had been growing outrage that the drug had only been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/06/ebola-virus-outbreak-test-approved-fda" title="">made available to two Americans</a> and Pajares – all westerners who had been repatriated to their home countries for treatment. Only limited quantities exist, however. The California-based manufacturer of ZMapp, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, said it had run out of treatment after responding to a request from an unidentified west African country.</p><p>There will be pressure on the company to manufacture more, following the WHO decision that its use, and that of other drugs yet to go through full clinical and human trials, is ethical in the current outbreak.</p><p>Canada is to donate 800 to 1,000 doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine for use in Africa, the country's health minister, Rona Ambrose, announced on Tuesday night.</p><p>Dr Greg Taylor, deputy chief public health officer of the Public Health Agency of Canada, told Reuters that Canada owns a small quantity of the vaccine and would need four to six months to make a large quantity. The vaccine has proven effective in animals but has never been tested in humans, he said.</p><p>The group of 12 international experts convened by the WHO concluded it was ethical in the situation in west Africa to offer unproven treatments with as yet unknown efficacy and adverse effects, either as treatment or prevention.</p><p>But they made clear high ethical standards must be observed. There must be complete transparency about the implications of the treatment and patients and their families must give informed consent – which means they must understand the risks as well as the possible benefits. There must also be freedom of choice, confidentiality, respect for the person, preservation of dignity and involvement of the community, the WHO said in a statement.</p><p>"There was unanimous agreement that there is a moral duty to also evaluate these interventions (for treatment or prevention) in the best possible clinical trials under the circumstances in order to definitively prove their safety and efficacy or provide evidence to stop their utilisation," the statement said.</p><p>Any experimental drugs will have to be given in effect as part of a clinical trial, therefore. The group said ethical ways of gathering data from their use in the difficult setting of an Ebola outbreak needed further discussion. There also needs to be further consideration of which experimental drugs and vaccines might be used and a fair way of distributing them given that demand is likely to outstrip supply.</p><p>Pajares was one of three missionaries to test positive for the virus at the San José de Monrovia hospital in Liberia. All three had been helping to treat people infected with Ebola as part of their work with the San Juan de Dios hospital order, a Catholic humanitarian organisation that runs hospitals around the world. The two other missionaries, from Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who were not evacuated, have also died in recent days from the virus.Pajares arrived in Spain with Juliana Bohi, a nun born in Equatorial Guinea who holds Spanish nationality, who tested negative for the virus.</p>

The virus has killed at least 932 people, in which there have been more than 1,711 reported infections across Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and most recently <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/11/ebola-virus-nigeria-lagos-patrick-sawyer">Nigeria</a>, according to WHO . </p> <p>Ebola has no known treatment or vaccine and the death rate has been about 50%, partly due to the poor state of healthcare systems in the affected countries. The virus spreads through direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids of an infected person.</p> <p>The Ebola virus has an incubation period of 21 days, meaning it takes roughly three weeks between exposure and onset of the often fatal illness.</p> <p>The quarantine is required as a preventive measure by a county health department in North Carolina, which is working with the state’s Department of Health and Human Services’ Division of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.<br /></p> <p>Health officials stressed that the quarantine is only precautionary, and that the missionaries currently pose no public health risk.</p> <p>“Quarantine is a public health measure to protect the public that requires healthy people who were exposed to a disease to be prevented from contact with others until it is certain that they are not infected,” Mecklenburg County medical director Dr Stephen Keener said in a <a href="http://charmeck.org/mecklenburg/county/MediaRoom/PR/Pages/Agencies-Coordinate-Return-of-Missionaries-from-West-Africa-.aspx">statement</a> on Sunday.</p> <p>After being released from quarantine, David said he plans to visit his wife Nancy in Atlanta, SIM USA president Bruce Johnson told reporters during a press conference on Monday afternoon.

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/09/liberia-monrovia-ebola-rumours-hygiene-hunger <p>Another day has just broken in Liberia's capital, Monrovia. Outside a block of humble flats on Centre Street, two women in long overcoats jump out of a taxi, avoiding the torrents of rainwater pouring along the gutter as they carry a large plastic bucket. On the porch, a crowd of young homeless men take shelter. They are about to receive a lesson in handwashing, non-contact and recognising symptoms of the deadly Ebola virus. It has killed 249 of their countrymen so far since March, 961 worldwide, and prompted 1,779 reported cases internationally.</p><p>The fact that Ebola is spread through bodily fluids such as sweat and saliva means that reducing physical contact has become a national obsession. At any time of day, outside banks, shops and homes, people disinfect their hands with chlorinated water. Shaking hands is forbidden and some have donned latex gloves.</p><p>Last week the government ramped up anti-Ebola measures. On Wednesday, Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, declared a state of emergency for 90 days. Her televised statement sent a new wave of fear through communities following two weeks of alarming announcements.</p><p>On Saturday as panic spread in the region, neighbouring Guinea closed its borders with Liberia and Sierra Leone and a nun from the Congo working for Spanish missionaries in Liberia became the latest victim of the virus.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-444176910'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/9/1407607831960/Nurses-bury-the-body-of-a-001.jpg' alt='Nurses bury the body of an Ebola victim in Liberia' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Nurses bury the body of an Ebola victim on the outskirts of Monrovia. Photograph: Ahmed Jallanzo/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>The Liberian government has already sent home nonessential staff, closed schools and forbidden large gatherings. Last week three days of national fasting and prayer pushed many businesses into shutting up shop. But Sirleaf's message that the new arrangements would allow the government to "institute extraordinary measures, including, if need be, the suspension of certain rights and privileges", has left many wondering what will happen next.</p><p>"No, I don't think the government has made the right decision," says one of the flats' residents, Christina Quinn, who has come down from a balcony clutching her one-year-old twins to listen to the women. "Three months is not a short time to declare a state of emergency. How do you expect citizens to get food and do their normal business?"</p><p>She says her mobile-phone business has suffered since the Ebola outbreak reached Monrovia. She is a single mother with four children to support. "It will increase the hardship, tension and prices, because now there is no cargo in the Monrovia area – they have closed the roads." Troops set up checkpoints last week to reduce people's movements in five of the country's 15 counties. But the operation trapped hundreds of travellers and traders in Ebola-affected areas outside the city. Liberia's land borders have also been closed since July, cutting off vital trade routes. The country is heavily dependent on imports, including 90% of the rice it consumes.</p><p>Quinn's neighbour shares her concerns. Charles Ngafuan, 16, is frying doughnuts on the next veranda. As he prods the dough deep into oil boiling over a charcoal stove, he explains that Ebola has pushed up the price of ingredients. "Before, a 50kg bag of flour was 2,500 Liberian dollars [£16.11]. Now it's L$3,500," he says. "Since Ebola has come, the food in the market has been scarce. People in the streets are hungry and I have more customers because they are looking for food." He will not charge more for his doughnuts to reflect rising costs, but he does plan to make them smaller.</p><p>The overcoated women position their bucket to catch rainwater shooting off the roof, and their organisation's director begins his Ebola speech. Michael John Bull of the British charity Street Child Liberia implores the group to take precautions. "Please wash your hands several times a day – we want you to be alive when this Ebola thing is over," he says. "People are dying, medical staff are dying – even American doctors – so we know this is real."</p><p>Mentioning the two medical staff from the US charity <a href="http://www.samaritans-purse.org.uk/" title="">Samaritan's Purse</a> who contracted the virus is necessary to convince the crowd that the threat from haemorrhagic fever is legitimate. One of the reasons Ebola is spreading is because people presenting symptoms do not believe the disease is real until they become highly contagious. Another reason is the wild rumours circulating Monrovia, such as one about doctors harvesting organs from unconfirmed Ebola cases. The virus, which has no cure, is considered a death sentence, with mortality rates in this outbreak at about 55%. Bull's audience shuffles carefully in the confined space as they listen. Their reluctance to touch each other suggests they are already heeding the advice.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-444176913'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/9/1407583393991/Monrovia-resident-Christi-011.jpg' alt='Monrovia resident Christina Quinn with her one-year-old twins' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Monrovia resident Christina Quinn with her one-year-old twins: 'For us now we can only depend on almighty God.' Photograph: Hannah Maule-Ffinch for the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>A truck pulls up, stacked with packets of water. Usually Liberians consider these safer than drinking from wells, but today business is slow for the sellers. Last week reports that some people poisoned water sources, including those used by drinking-water companies, have left people unsure of what is safe. A Liberian newspaper published photos of two suspects on Friday, along with one of a dead dog that "melted instantly upon drinking water from the well". Fear provoked by the scandal has spread easily among the tense population.</p><p>It is these economic and social concerns that are consuming Monrovians, rather than the Ebola sickness itself. The images published in the international press of corpses thrown from houses and health workers fastened into rubber bodysuits are far from a reality in the city. "I haven't seen any bodies in the street," says social worker Prosper Perkins. "I heard on the radio there were two bodies at Barnesville Junction, but there was no testing centre to identify what caused their death. I'm of the strong opinion those people died of other illnesses because doctors and nurses have abandoned the hospitals for their own safety."</p><p>Since the crisis began, medical staff have fled their jobs to avoid Ebola victims, forcing clinics to close. People with diseases common in the rainy season, such as malaria and typhoid, are thus unable to find treatment. Some fear if they do, doctors will suspect them of having Ebola and quarantine them with infectious patients.</p><p>Bull produces a bag of white chlorine powder and adds it to the now filled bucket. But some of the men on the porch have lost interest and start asking for food. A couple have scraped together L$10 for a doughnut, which comes wrapped in yesterday's newspaper, filled with Ebola news. But the rest are hungry. "If we don't get some support for our condition, we'll make trouble," one threatens, shivering in damp clothes.</p><p>His threat is a reminder of what Monrovians really fear: that the stability they have gradually built up since 2003, when the country's horrific civil war ended, will fall apart. The general secretary of Liberia's YMCA, the country's oldest youth organisation, warned last week that young people would revert to crime if they could not feed themselves. "Young people are still very conflict-prone and can easily be mobilised into hostilities," Edward Gboe said from a deserted YMCA headquarters. "In terms of full-scale civil war, that is unlikely. But with violence it's possible we could be going backwards."</p><p>One of the YMCA's beneficiaries, a 22-year-old trainee hairdresser, says she is afraid. Single mother Grace Cole lives in a slum. Her training in a salon near Centre Street is funded by British charity Y Care International. She already feels the country is at war. "Foreigners are scared of coming here now, which makes me feel very, very bad.</p><p>"I remember the war from when I was little: people killing people in front of me and raping. I'm worried about the situation getting worse."</p><p>Bull and his team manage to calm the restless group and position the prepared bucket on the porch's brick wall. One by one, the rain having slowed, the men turn the bucket's plastic tap and douse their hands in the life-saving water. Girls appear on the porch to try the new ritual. On Sunday, like many Liberians, Bull will go to church to pray for the crisis to end. "Even in the church, the priest will announce from the pulpit not to shake hands or touch," he says. "People will stand far apart from each other."</p><p>Quinn says that praying is almost all local people can do. "For us now, we can only depend on almighty God," she says.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/08/us-ebola-victim-hospital-growing-stronger-every-day <p>One of the two Americans being treated for the Ebola virus in the US said he is “growing stronger every day” in <a href="https://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews/status/497811735957749762">a letter released on Friday</a>. </p> <p>“I am growing stronger every day, and I thank God for his mercy as I have wrestled with this terrible disease,” Dr Kent Brantly wrote from his isolation room at Emory University hospital in Atlanta, where he has been since being transported to the US from Liberia on Saturday.<br /></p> <p>Brantly was the first named Ebola victim to be treated in the US, and is one of two American charity workers infected. The other, Nancy Writebol, is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/06/ebola-infected-americans-experimental-drug-recovery-atlanta">also being treated in Atlanta</a>.<br /></p> <p>Brantly contracted Ebola while working in a Liberian hospital for the international relief group Samaritan’s Purse. The organisation released Brantly’s statement, which said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>One thing I have learned is that following God often leads us to unexpected places. When Ebola spread into Liberia, my usual hospital work turned more and more toward treating the increasing number of Ebola patients. I held the hands of countless individuals as this terrible disease took their lives away from them. I witnessed the horror first-hand, and I can still remember every face and name.</p> <p>When I started feeling ill on that Wednesday morning, I immediately isolated myself until the test confirmed my diagnosis three days later. When the result was positive, I remember a deep sense of peace that was beyond all understanding. God was reminding me of what he had taught me years ago: that he will give me everything I need to be faithful to him.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/08/who-ebola-outbreak-international-public-health-emergency">World Health Organisation</a> declared the outbreak, the world’s largest and longest, an international public health emergency on Friday.<br /></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/08/ebola-dengue-cholera-epidemics <p>The Ebola epidemic that is still spreading across west Africa was recently labelled <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/08/who-ebola-outbreak-international-public-health-emergency" title="">an international health emergency</a> by the World Health Organisation.  The first cases of Ebola were diagnosed in Guinea <a href="http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4071-ebola-virus-disease-guinea-30-march-2014.html" title="">six months earlier </a>though. Could the outbreak have been contained much sooner?</p><p>While there is no cure for Ebola, professor Peter Piot, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28673380" title="">who co-discovered the disease in 1976</a>, says experimental drugs could have more widely used.</p><p>"African governments should be allowed to make informed decisions about whether or not to use these products - for example to protect and treat healthcare workers who run especially high risks of infection."</p><p>But Ebola is just one disease for which the global health community has seemed ill-prepared.  Recent Cholera outbreaks in <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/fr/report/100447/cholera-surges-in-cameroon" title="">Cameroon</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/world/americas/un-struggles-to-stem-haiti-cholera-epidemic.html?_r=0" title="">Haiti</a>, as well as the constant threat of diseases in refugee camps from <a href="http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/jordan_69721.html" title="">Jordan</a> to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/malnutrition-disease-rising-in-burmese-muslim-camps/2014/07/29/4c5dc62c-135b-11e4-98ee-daea85133bc9_story.html" title="">Burma</a> reflect the multiple pressures on limited resources on manpower. It would seem that epidemics are taking humanitarian response to the brink.</p><p>So what should governments, humanitarians and health workers do?</p><p>When previous epidemics such as the Sars virus and bird flu were declared international health emergencies, many governments were criticised for <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2003/04/29/debate-are-we-overreacting-on-sars-140718/" title="">overreacting</a>  or <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4295649.stm" title="">underreacting</a>.

"I urge the international community to provide this support on the most urgent basis possible."</p><p>The current outbreak began in Guinea in March and has spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia, with some cases in Nigeria. There is no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola and the death rate has been about 50%.</p><p>The virus has an incubation period of up to 21 days, meaning symptoms do not necessarily show before then.</p><p>The WHO emergency committee unanimously agreed, after two days of meetings in Geneva and teleconferences with representatives in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, that the outbreak was "an extraordinary event", meeting all the conditions for a public health emergency, Chan said.</p><p>With 1,711 confirmed and suspected cases, and 932 deaths, the WHO said the outbreak was a public health risk to other states – particularly in view of "fragile health care systems" in the affected countries.</p><p>Although the WHO said that "there should be no general ban on international travel or trade," it issued a long list of recommendations on travel and contacts, including urging that all travellers leaving the countries affected by the outbreak should be screened for fever, and that no corpses should be transported across borders.</p><p>It said other states should provide information to people travelling to affected and at risk areas, be prepared to detect, investigate and manage Ebola cases, and be prepared for the evacuation and repatriation of nationals, including health workers.</p><p>States should also ensure access to specialist diagnostic laboratories, and prepare to manage travellers who arrive at international airports or border crossings with "unexplained febrile illness".</p><p>"The possible consequences of further international spread are particularly serious in view of the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems in the currently affected and most at-risk countries," a statement said. "A coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop and reverse the international spread of Ebola."</p><p>The charity Save the Children, which said it was scaling up its operations in the region, warned that medical services in the affected countries were already overwhelmed. Rob MacGillivray, its regional humanitarian director, said that even before the outbreak there was less than one doctor for every 33,000 people in Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p><p>"Parents are understandably frightened and stay away from medical centres through fear of coming into contact with the infection. Pregnant mothers are giving birth at home rather than seeking skilled help and orphaned children are at risk of being ostracised from their communities at the most vulnerable time in their lives.</p><p>"Challenges remain in reaching families in rural communities who were struggling to access healthcare even before the outbreak."</p><p>The WHO said health advice at airports and ports or border crossings should warn travellers that though the disease is rare, careful hygiene should be practised, and all contact with blood and body fluids of infected people or animals, or with any items that have come in contact with such blood or body fluids, must be avoided.</p><p>It also says that sexual intercourse with a sick person or one recovering from Ebola should be avoided "for at least seven weeks".</p><p>The WHO <a href="http://" title="">advises that the risk to travellers from sharing a flight with somebody who is showing symptoms of Ebola</a> is "very low" – but does recommend contacting fellow travellers if a sufferer reports their condition and seeks medical help on arrival.</p><p>For those travelling to affected areas, the WHO describes the risk of business travellers or tourists returning with the virus as "extremely low" – even, it says, "if the visit included travel to the local areas from which primary cases have been reported".</p><p>"Transmission requires direct contact with blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected living or dead persons or animals, all unlikely exposures for the average traveller. Tourists are in any event advised to avoid all such contacts."</p><p>It said the risk to travellers visiting friends and relatives in affected countries was similarly low "unless the traveller has direct physical contact with a sick or dead person or animal infected with Ebola virus".</p><p>The long list of advice to affected states includes screening all travellers leaving for fever, banning the remains of those who have died of Ebola from being transported across borders, and ensuring "funerals and burials are conducted by well-trained personnel".</p><p>Countries with land borders with the affected states are urged "urgently to establish surveillance for clusters of unexplained fever or deaths due to febrile illness", and to act within 24 hours of any suspected cases.</p><p>The United States is sending teams of experts to Liberia, including 12 specialists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after the Liberian president, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, declared a 90-day state of emergency and said the disease had overwhelmed her country's healthcare system.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/07/ebola-patients-west-africa-denied-experimental-drugs-us-nigeria <p>West African patients infected with the Ebola virus will not have access to experimental drugs being used to treat American cases of the disease for several months, if at all, Nigerian health authorities said on Thursday.</p><p>Health minister Onyebuchi Chukwu told a press conference he had asked the US health authorities about the unproven medicines used on two American doctors, but was told such small quantities existed that west Africa would have to wait for months for supplies, even if they were proved safe and effective.</p><p>Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol of the evangelical Christian organisation Samaritan's Purse contracted the virus while helping to treat victims in Liberia. They were given the drug ZMapp after being evacuated to the US, and appear to be recovering.</p><p>A spokesman for the US Centres for Disease Control said "there are virtually no doses available" and they would take several months to manufacture.</p><p>Even if supplies do become available, medical ethicists are divided over whether they should be used in the current Ebola outbreak in west Africa. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has called a meeting of experts next week to help it guide doctors and drug companies who may consider shipping experimental drugs to the four countries hit by the disease.</p><p>"We are in an unusual situation in this outbreak. We have a disease with a high fatality rate, without any proven treatment or vaccine," said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director general at the WHO. "We need to ask the medical ethicists to give us guidance on what the responsible thing to do is."</p><p>Prof Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, welcomed the meeting, saying there were critical ethical questions to consider.</p><p>He called for the rapid establishment of "rigorous protocols for the study of experimental interventions", so that African countries could have the same opportunities to consider them as western ones and to ensure there would be equitable access to any treatment that worked.</p><p>Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said there were many questions.</p><p>"Giving unlicensed and untested (at least in humans) treatments and vaccines is a very thorny ethical issue," he said. "The infected US healthcare workers are receiving a type of treatment (antibodies that specifically target the virus) that has a reasonably long safety track record, so it isn't surprising – given the high fatality rate in the current outbreak – that they are happy to receive the therapy.</p><p>"But not all drugs are safe – that's why we have very stringent clinical trials. One could argue that the current outbreak provides a perfect arena in which to test new drugs, but that isn't without risk. We don't know their safety, we don't know if they are likely to work – sure, they have been tested in animals, but these studies don't always tell us what will happen in humans."</p><p>Some of the new treatments have not been tried with human at all, said Prof Tom Solomon, director of the NIHR health protection research unit in emerging and zoonotic infections. It is usual for drugs to be tried in healthy volunteers first, in case of side-effects. "The difference here is the desire for this 'first in man' experiment to be for a patient with the disease," he said.</p><p>"What is key is that if these new experimental drugs are going to be used, then this should only be done in the context of a clinical trial. Otherwise the worry is that we will have tried these drugs, including putting people through the potential risk of experimental treatments, and still be none the wiser about which are effective."</p><p>Paul Hunter, professor of health protection at the University of East Anglia, said most doctors in a situation like that of west Africa would want to try a drug that might work.</p><p>"In my view, the ethical case is unequivocal. If a patient is likely to die and an experimental therapy has a reasonable chance to prevent death, then it should be given. However, this does not mean that any old drug could be given. For an experimental compound to be given, there should be good prior evidence that the therapy will work, the patient or his relatives should give informed consent wherever possible and whenever the therapy is given proper records must be kept and the outcome reported to WHO," he said.</p><p>Unicef, meanwhile, warned that children who had been orphaned by Ebola were finding themselves shunned by their communities. "Children who are orphaned by the disease are finding it hard to be accepted in their communities and this has had huge psychological impacts on their lives," said the Unicef representative in Sierra Leone, Roeland Monasch.</p><p>"The Ebola outbreak has led to widespread misconceptions and myths and these are posing serious challenges in the fight to eradicate it."</p><p>• This article was amended on 14 August 2014 because an earlier version referred to Nancy Writebol as "Dr Nancy Writebol of the evangelical Christian organisation Samantha's Purse".

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/ebola-spanish-missionary-miguel-pajares-virus-liberia-flown-spain <p>A Spanish missionary who contracted the Ebola virus in Liberia is in stable condition after arriving in Madrid on Thursday, health officials said.</p><p>Miguel Pajares, 75, arrived shortly after 8am local time (0700 BST) on a specially-equipped Airbus plane. He is the first Ebola patient of the current outbreak to be brought to Europe for treatment.</p><p>The hospital had been emptied of patients in preparation for Pajares's arrival, health union officials said. The 30 or so patients in the hospital were either sent home or to another hospital in the city. Pajares arrived with Juliana Bohi, a nun born in Equatorial Guinea and who holds Spanish nationality. Bohi is not thought to be infected.</p><p>After a medical examination on the tarmac at the Torrejón air base, the pair were taken to Madrid's Carlos III hospital in ambulances equipped as biological isolation units. Police cars and motorcycles escorted the vehicles, and a helicopter monitored the situation from above.</p><p>Bohi was admitted to the same hospital as a preventative measure, health officials said.</p><p>Initial examinations showed Pajares to be in stable condition, according to Rafael Pérez-Santamarina, the director of Madrid's La Paz hospital. The city's regional government health chief, Francisco Javier Rodríguez, said Pajares was not bleeding and seemed not to be at an advanced stage of the illness.</p><video data-media-id="gu-video-444054627" class="gu-video" controls="controls" poster="">\n        <source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/08/07/140807Ebola-16x9.mp4"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/08/07/140807Ebola/140807Ebola.m3u8"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/08/07/140807Ebola.webm"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/08/07/140807Ebola_3gpSml16x9.3gp"></source><source src="http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/08/07/140807Ebola_3gpLg16x9.3gp"></source>\n      </video><p>Pajares was one of three missionaries to test positive for the virus at the San José de Monrovia hospital in Liberia. The three were part of a larger group which had been helping to treat people infected with Ebola as part of their work with the San Juan de Dios order, a Catholic humanitarian organisation that runs hospitals around the world.</p><p>News of his repatriation was met with controversy in Spain, and health professionals were concerned that Spanish hospitals were not properly equipped to handle the virus. Amyts, a trade union that represents physicians, called the repatriation risky. The union's president, Daniel Bernabéu, told the Spanish news agency Efe that the decision was "political rather than health-related".</p><p>Asking if "anyone could guarantee 100% that the virus wouldn't escape," he said that Spain could have instead sent help to the priest in Liberia.</p><p>He said the US, which has repatriated two of its own nationals to date, had 10 hospitals with the highest level of biosafety possible. Spain, in contrast, has just one adequate hospital with biosafety levels that were much lower.</p><p>An official from the Spain's health ministry downplayed the potential public health risk at a news conference on Wednesday. The public health director general, Mercedes Vinuesa, assured Spaniards that the protocols in place for the evacuation would "guarantee minimum risk".</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/07/experts-australian-hospitals-diseases-malaria-ebola-alert <p>Leading infectious diseases experts have warned Australian hospital staff not to become so concerned about detecting cases of the Ebola virus that they fail to recognise other concerning, but more common, diseases in their patients.<br /></p> <p>The Ebola virus outbreak unfolding in West Africa is the largest recorded, with more than 1,700 people known to be infected and numbers continuing to rise. Previously, the largest outbreak was in Sudan in 2000, which affected 425 people.</p> <p>Concerns about the virus, a type of haemorrhagic fever, prompted the New South Wales department of health to <a href="http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/alerts/Documents/EVD-brief-information-for-EDs-and-clinicians-05Aug2014.pdf">issue information to state emergency departments and clinicians</a> advising them to be on the lookout for cases. The federal health department <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/6C08E643DAAB9ED0CA257D1D0008D265/$File/ebola-clinicians-20140804.pdf">made similar information</a> available to doctors last month.</p> <p>A professor of infectious diseases at the Australian National University, Peter Collignon, said Australia was right to take precautions and doctors should be aware of the virus. </p> <p>“But equally, we need to realise that if our fear overtakes everything then the reality is, we run a risk of people dying because we’re not treating them for other illnesses as quickly as we should be.”</p> <p>Heightened awareness of Ebola may mean people returning from Africa with malaria may be wrongfully suspected of having Ebola while malaria was overlooked altogether, he said. It could lead to the patient being quarantined as is protocol, and proper treatment being delayed while Ebola was being ruled out.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/testing/timeline/index.html?data=Ebola" data-alt="Ebola timeline"> <a href="http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/testing/timeline/index.html?data=Ebola">Ebola timeline</a> </figure>  <p>Malaria, which is spread by mosquitoes, typically has symptoms including high fevers, shaking chills, and flu-like illness, similar to the initial symptoms of Ebola. </p> <p>“People coming back from Africa are much more likely to have malaria,” said Collignon, who is also a specialist doctor. “We can’t let fear overtake our ability to deliver care but unfortunately, this does sometimes happen when a rare disease outbreak occurs. </p> <p>“Health professionals are only human and can become overly fearful too, suspecting Ebola too quickly. But people have fevers for a whole range of reasons.”</p> <p>He said similar fears occurred during the Sars virus outbreak which affected about a dozen countries back in 2003, and Australian health departments braced themselves for cases.</p> <p>“There were times when medical and nursing staff wouldn’t go near suspected patients, and it happens around the world during epidemics,” he said. “It’s not that staff shouldn’t be cautious, but fear can paralyse individuals and it can also paralyse a health system.”</p> <p>Even if a case did turn up in Australia, he said the training of hospital staff meant it would not spread far. While Sars is a respiratory disease spread through coughing and sneezing, Ebola is more difficult to spread in countries with strong health systems and hygiene practices because it requires direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people to be transmitted.</p> <p>He added that Europe was much more likely to see cases of Ebola than Australia, but the illness was yet to appear there either.</p> <p>Associate professor Allen Cheng from Monash University’s department of epidemiology and preventive medicine said although Ebola was highly unlikely to enter Australia, its rareness and grotesque symptoms, including uncontrollable bleeding, meant it had captured people’s imaginations.</p> <p>He emphasised that the disease should not be downplayed, but said perspective about risk to Australians was needed.</p> <p>“People in Australia are interested in it because it’s rare and dramatic and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/08/04/the-best-movie-to-watch-during-the-current-ebola-outbreak/">people make movies about this sort of thing</a>,” he said. “But the most likely scenario is not someone coming from overseas with Ebola, but malaria. </p> <p>“We do need to make sure that everyone isn’t so panicked about this that they are failing to detect and treat malaria patients.”</p> <p>The reason the current outbreak was proving more difficult to contain than others was because it had hit West Africa, which had weaker medical resourcing than central Africa, where outbreaks had occurred previously.</p> <p>It meant health workers and the general community in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone had not been trained to recognise and treat the illness.</p> <p>Funeral practices in the region, where people touch the deceased, meant the virus was also being spread in that way, Cheng said. </p> <p>The World Health Organisation began a two-day meeting on Thursday to discuss measures needed to contain the virus.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/07/barack-obama-ebola-spread-global-effort-who <p>Barack Obama has said a global effort is required to combat the spread of Ebola which he blamed on weak and overwhelmed health systems in west Africa.</p><p>Speaking at the end of a summit of African leaders in Washington, the president said the disease – which has claimed the lives of more than 900 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – can be controlled and contained with the right resources. A single case has also been confirmed in Nigeria.</p><p>"The Ebola virus both currently and in the past is controlled if you have a strong public health infrastructure in place and countries that have been affected are first to admit that what's happened here is their public health systems have been overwhelmed. They weren't able to identify and then isolate cases quickly enough," he said. "You did not have a strong trust relationship between some of the communities that were affected and health workers. As a consequence it spread more rapidly."</p><p>Obama said the US is working with European countries and the World Health Organisation (WHO) to respond to the crisis. The US centres for disease control moved Ebola to its highest category of health threat.</p><p>"Let's get all the health workers we need on the ground. Let's help to bolster the systems that there are in place. Let's nip as early as possible any additional outbreaks of the disease," he said.</p><p>But the president said it was too early to decide whether an experimental drug given to an American health worker who contracted Ebola and has been flown back to the US could be distributed in Africa.</p><p>Obama said the Ebola outbreak was discussed in his collective meetings with African leaders behind closed doors on the third and final day of the largest summit of the continent's governments held in Washington. He said that one consequence was a decision to establish an African centre for disease control. HIV/Aids was also on the agenda with a plan to double the number of children receiving life saving antiretroviral drugs.</p><p>Obama described the summit as an "extraordinary event" which promoted trade and discussed issues ranging from combatting corruption to women's rights and freedom of the press. The president said there was common agreement on the need to deepen security cooperation against terrorism because of spreading violent instability in parts of the continent, from Boko Haram in Nigeria to the al-Shabab in Somalia which is destabilising neighbouring Kenya.</p><p>"The United States doesn't have a desire to expand and create a big footprint inside of Africa," he said.</p><p>Instead, the president said Washington will back a "new security governance initiative" to strengthen security forces of African countries.</p><p>"We're starting with Kenya, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Ghana and Egypt," he said.</p><p>But human rights groups say that anti-terrorism strategies and laws in countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya are increasingly used in parts of Africa to suppress political activity and the press, and that American-backed security forces in Nigeria and Kenya are responsible for attacks on civilians and other abuses.</p><p>Obama defended the relationships.</p><p>"Many times we will work with countries even though they're not perfect on every issue. We find that in some cases engaging in a country that in general is a good partner but is not conforming optimally when it comes to all the various categories of human rights, we can be effective by working with them on certain areas and criticising them and trying to elicit improvements in other areas," he said.</p><p>But the president acknowledged that the fight against armed groups is undermined when government forces assault the civilian population, such as accusations by human rights groups that the Nigerian military has massacred innocent people and destroyed property in its war with Boko Haram.</p><p>"One of the encouraging things in the sessions was a recognition that fighting terrorism also requires security forces that are professional, that are disciplined, that are themselves not engaging in human rights violations," he said. "That part of the lesson we've all learned about terrorism is that it's possible in reaction to terrorism to actually accelerate the disease if the response is one that alienates populations or particular ethnic groups or particular religions."</p><p>Demonstrators from several African countries gathered not far from the State Department where the summit was meeting. Jacques Miango from the Democratic Republic of Congo accused Obama of abandoning a commitment to support "strong institutions not strong men" by inviting president Joseph Kabila.</p><p>"Now in Congo we have a strong man not strong institutions. We are here to see if Obama will keep his word," he said.</p><p>The US says that the secretary of state, John Kerry, met Kabila on Monday and told him that Washington expects him to abide by Congo's constitution and leave power after two terms as president in 2016.</p><p>Protestors from Burkina Faso pressed home a similar message over president Blaise Compaoré who they accuse of attempting to change his country's constitution to extend his 27 year rule.</p><p>Demonstrators from Ghana stood across the street demanding that Obama get President John Mahama to account for $30bn in loans in recent years.</p><p>"No water, no electricity. Is this the better Ghana?" said one sign.</p><p>Several African leaders cancelled scheduled press conferences at the end of the summit, including South Sudan, Somalia and Tanzania. Others said they would only speak to the official press from their own nations.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/06/ebola-infected-americans-experimental-drug-recovery-atlanta <p>Two American aid workers infected with Ebola have shown signs of recovery after receiving a “cocktail” of experimental drugs manufactured by a Californian and a Toronto-based biotech firm.</p> <p>Nancy Writebol, 59, was wheeled from an ambulance <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/05/ebola-nancy-writebol-aid-worker-atlanta-emory">to an isolation unit</a> at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Tuesday. Her colleague, Dr Kent Brantly, 33, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/03/condition-ebola-infected-us-doctor-improved-hospital">arrived two days earlier</a> in markedly better condition, walking under his own power from the ambulance to the isolation unit. Both wore protective suits. </p> <p>The drugs used to treat Writebol and Brantly were developed by San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical and Canada’s Defyrus and given to both in Liberia before their return to the US. <br /></p> <p>Ebola, which spreads via the blood or other bodily fluids of an infected person, has a fatality rate of up to 90%, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). On Wednesday, WHO <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/06/ebola-outbreak-nurse-nigeria-dies">said the death toll from the latest</a>, and largest, outbreak had reached 932 with deaths reported in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone and that more than 1,600 people infected.<br /></p> <p>The Americans received the drugs after Samaritan’s Purse, for which Brantly was working, contacted the officials with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who are in Liberia to discuss various experimental treatments. What is so far unknown is whether they are recovering on their own, as others who have survived Ebola have done, or as a result of the treatment.<br /></p> <p>“Every medicine has risks and benefits,” CDC Director Tom Frieden told the Associated Press. “Until we do a study, we don’t know if it helps, if it hurts, or if it doesn’t make any difference.”</p> <p>The treatment, which combines Mapp’s drug, ZMapp and ZMAb from Defyrus, is one of several currently being developed to tackle Ebola. It has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and had previously only been tested on monkeys. ZMapp is manufactured in Nicotiana plants, the genus that includes tobacco plants.<br /></p> <p>In a statement Mapp said very little of the drug is available and they are “cooperating with appropriate government agencies to increase production as quickly as possible”.<br /></p> <p>“Any decision to use an experimental drug in a patient would be a decision made by the treating physician under the regulatory guidelines of the FDA,” the company said in a statement.</p> <p>In August last year Dr Larry Zeitlin, president of Mapp Biopharmaceutical, and James Pettitt, of the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, published a report on an experimental Ebola treatment that protected 100% of non-human primates when given one hour after Ebola exposure.</p> <p>According to the report in Science Translational Medicine 43% of infected monkeys recovered after receiving the treatment 104 to 120 hours after infection – when they had developed measurable symptoms of disease. </p> <p>The treatment, dubbed MB-003, is a “cocktail” of monoclonal antibodies, which are designed to bind to and inactivate the virus. Pettitt said the antibodies recognized infected cells and triggered the immune system to kill them off. No side effects of the antibodies were observed in the surviving animals. </p> <p>In March Mapp was one of 15 organisations awarded $28m by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to establish a new centre for excellence to find an antibody “cocktail” to fight the Ebola virus. The project is be led by Erica Ollmann Saphire, professor at the Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), one of the world’s largest not-for-profit organizations focusing on research in the biomedical sciences.</p> <p>Mapp and Defyrus are working with LeafBio of San Diego, the US government and the Public Health Agency of Canada on development of its drug.</p> <p>Family members for Writebol and Brantly say their conditions have improved. “A week ago we were thinking about making funeral arrangements for Nancy,” her husband, David Writebol, said in a statement read by SIM USA president Bruce Johnson. “Now we have a real reason to be hopeful.”</p> <p>Brantly’s wife, Amber, said he is in good spirits. “I have been able to see Kent every day, and he continues to improve,” she <a href="http://www.samaritanspurse.org/article/samaritans-purse-doctor-serving-in-liberia-west-africa-tests-positive-for-ebola/">said in a statement.</a></p>

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/06/ebola-outbreak-nurse-nigeria-dies <p>A nurse who treated Nigeria's first Ebola victim has died of the virus in Lagos as five new cases of the highly lethal disease were confirmed in Africa's most populous country.</p><p>The nurse had helped care for Patrick Sawyer, a 40-year-old Liberian-American civil servant who last month visited from Liberia, one of three countries in the region hit by the world's biggest epidemic. The five new cases are believed to be other health workers who came into contact with Sawyer, who died within days of his arrival.</p><p>The total death toll from the Ebola outbreak has now risen to 932 after another 45 patients died between 2 and 4 August, the World Health Organisation said.</p><p>"Yesterday the first known Nigerian to die of Ebola was recorded. This was one of the nurses that attended to the Liberian. The other five [newly confirmed] cases are being treated at an isolation ward," the Nigerian health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, told reporters in the capital, Abuja, on Wednesday.</p><p>Officials initially downplayed the risk of exposure, saying Sawyer had been immediately isolated when he collapsed on arrival at Lagos's bustling main airport two weeks ago.</p><p>But on Tuesday the state health commissioner, Jide Idris, said Ebola was diagnosed only after Sawyer had been taken to hospital  and had direct or indirect contact with at least 70 others. They include airline passengers, airport officials and health workers, and have all been placed under precautionary surveillance. Seven have been quarantined.</p><p>Officials told reporters they were compiling a list of secondary contacts, and appealed to those who believed they may be at risk to come forward. "This is a call for everyone to be vigilant, especially with regard to relating to people who are ill," Idris said.</p><p>The virus has an incubation period of up to 21 days, meaning symptoms do not necessarily show before then. Once transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of infected persons, meat or surfaces, a fever quickly degenerates into internal and external bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea, which all contain vast amounts of the pathogen.</p><p>A committee has been set up to deal with any potential escalation of the disease, although Nigerian officials admitted there was a shortage of doctors willing to work directly with confirmed cases. "Our doctors are worried about the danger it poses to their lives and the need to be reassured," said Tope Ojo, Lagos chairman of the Nigerian Medical Association.</p><p>Doctors and healthcare workers on the frontline have been the hardest hit during the outbreak, which has so far killed 887 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Authorities said they were considering applying for an experimental drug used on two Americans to treat the doctor who headed Sawyer's team and is now battling the virus herself.</p><p>Other preventive measures have been unveiled across Nigeria. Lagos, a melting pot of 20 million people, has broadcast information on radios and through leaflets, distributed protective clothing to health workers and set up four isolation wards.</p><p>In the northern state of Kaduna, officials said corpses from outside the country would require special permission for burial. Two suspected Ebola-infected corpses in the southern states of Anambra and Akwa Ibom are believed to be victims flown in from Guinea. Authorities have sealed the morgues while samples are being tested.</p><p>This week, troops were deployed in Sierra Leone and Liberia to help protect medical workers and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/doctor-nigeria-ebola-victim-lagos" title="">quarantine the villages</a> at the centre of the epidemic.</p><p>The Spanish defence ministry said on Wednesday it had sent a medically equipped Airbus 310 to Liberia to repatriate a Spanish priest who has tested positive for the virus. The priest, Miguel Pajares, is one of three missionaries being kept in isolation at the San Jose de Monrovia hospital in Liberia. The other two infected aid workers were identified as Chantal Pascaline Mutwamene, of Congo, and Paciencia Melgar, from Equatorial Guinea.</p><p>Al-Arabiya reported on Wednesday that <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/08/06/Saudi-man-dies-of-suspected-Ebola-virus-.html" title="">a Saudi man in hospital in Jeddah with suspected Ebola</a> after a business trip to Sierra Leone had died.</p><p>In neighbouring Ivory Coast, a regional athletic contest due to be held this month has been cancelled. "There was really no benefit in holding the games until things are under control. We don't want to trigger hysteria," sports minister Alain Lobognon said.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/aug/06/terrifying-facts-ebola-for-scaremongering <p>Ebola is no laughing matter. Let’s make that clear from the start. It is a deeply unpleasant and dangerous disease, with a fatality rate of up to 90%. In lay terms, for every 10 people who get it, only 1 survives, making it among the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_disease_case_fatality_rates">most lethal diseases known to man</a>. </p> <p>There is no known cure or vaccine (although <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/05/ebola-nancy-writebol-aid-worker-atlanta-emory">experimental drugs are being tried</a>). The onset is sudden, but the incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days, so if you’ve got it you won’t know straight away. And the symptoms are, frankly, horrific. Even the initial symptoms are unpleasantly flu-like (proper <a href="http://www.patient.co.uk/health/influenza-and-flu-like-illness">flu</a>, not “don’t want to admit it’s just a cold” flu). Muscle pain, weakness, headache, sore throat, Ebola can cause all of these. And that’s just for starters. It quickly moves on to causing vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and sometimes both internal AND external bleeding. This blood loss invariably leads to death. </p> <p>These details aren’t from some blog written by a paranoid hypochondriac obsessed with worst-case scenarios. They are from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_disease_case_fatality_rates">World Health Organisation Ebola factsheet</a>, almost a textbook definition of a “reliable source”. All in all, the Ebola outbreak is awful, and those suffering from it deserve all possible support and sympathy for what they’re going through, while those trying to tackle the problem deserve all manner of praise and respect.</p> <p>However, despite all the dreadful things about this outbreak, if you go by media coverage, the worst thing about it is that it <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/04/ebola-public-discourse-xenophobia-midwives-nigeria">might end up affecting people in the UK</a>, US or similarly developed wealthy nations. And we can’t have that now, can we. </p> <p>Actually, perhaps that’s a bit harsh. Thanks to 24-hour rolling news and the internet, those of us in the developed world are constantly spoiled for choice when it comes to hearing about how absolutely awful things are happening to people in other countries. With such a constant bombardment of bleak information, it is perhaps to be expected that people will prioritise and preferably want to hear about things that may directly impact their lives. But much of the media seems to have readily descended into scaremongering to gain readers/traffic, and we know <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/may/14/scaremongering-pandemic-could-claim-countless-lives">how dangerous scaremongering can be</a>.</p> <p>Some media sources have tried to present a <a href="http://time.com/3079518/ebola-outbreak-pandemic-fear/">calm</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html?_r=1">rational</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/05/ebola-worrying-disease">reflective</a> report of the Ebola situation.

As well as this, paranoia coupled with poor understanding leads people to act irrationally. I say this as someone who knows people who, during the early stages of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic">2009 Mexican swine flu scare</a>, cancelled a planned trip to a <a href="http://www.chiquito.co.uk/">Chiquito</a> restaurant in Cardiff, a Mexican <em>themed </em>eatery half a planet away from the affected area. There’s “cautious”, and there’s … whatever you’d call this.</p> <p>However dangerous it may be, Ebola can (<a href="http://jvi.asm.org/content/84/19/9733.full">at present</a>) only be contracted by exchanging fluids with an infected sufferer, through the mouth, eyes, nose or other access point to inside the body. Ebola is a tenacious virus and strict precautions must be taken when dealing with it. However, you’re not going to get it just because you were on the same landmass as someone who has it.</p> <p>Having said all this, if the mainstream media will insist on scaremongering about Ebola, here are some terrifying “facts” about Ebola that they could use, with my blessing. Better they use those than <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/04/todd-rokita-ebola_n_5649219.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000013">scapegoat innocent people</a>, I guess. </p> <ul> <li>The Ebola virus can be up to <a href="http://www.microbiologytext.com/index.php?module=Book&amp;func=displayarticle&amp;art_id=494">14,000 nanometres in length</a>. That’s surprisingly large for a virus, but still too small to see with the naked eye. But if it were the size of a car, it could kill you if dropped on you from even a modest height!</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Ebola is not the deadliest virus known to mankind in terms of number of overall deaths caused, but if it ends up causing more deaths than the deadliest virus known to mankind, then Ebola would be the deadliest virus known to mankind!</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Some have reported that the Ebola outbreak could be much worse than is believed due to the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ebola-outbreak-could-be-much-worse-than-thought/">full number of cases not being reported</a>. However, if you’re basing conclusions on information we don’t have, there’s no limit to how many people might have Ebola. You, the one reading this, could have it right now! We don’t have any information to suggest otherwise, so who’s to know?</li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/voxdotcom">Vox recently reported</a> that if the supercontinent <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/8/4/5966901/world-map-pangaea-never-split?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=voxdotcom&amp;utm_content=monday">Pangaea were to reform today</a>, the US would border the Ebola epidemic locations, which would obviously make it easier for the virus to spread. While this may be true, we can take comfort from the fact that, if all the continents on Earth were to suddenly rearrange themselves, the resultant geological, environmental and societal devastation would achieve apocalyptic levels several times over, so a localised (if deadly) virus would be way down on the list of concerns for whatever is left of the human race at this point.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Ebola is believed to be carried by fruit bats, and the wastes or meat from such bats <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/04/ebola-risk-guinea-fruit-bats">is believed to have caused the current outbreak</a>. Bats are <a href="http://www.bats.org.uk/pages/bats_of_the_world.html">common throughout the world</a>, and some are believed to be <a href="http://www.batcon.org/index.php/media-and-info/bats-archives.html?task=viewArticle&amp;magArticleID=614">vampires in disguise</a>, and vampires can sneak into your bedroom and drink your blood as you sleep. If the vampire that bites you transforms into an Ebola-carrying bat, then this would be a sure-fire way of contracting Ebola. You can’t be too careful, after all.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>If you laid out all the recorded victims of Ebola end-to-end, the end result would be so horrific as to defy description, and you’d probably be arrested and/or placed in a high-security psychiatric facility for having done such a grotesque thing.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Some have claimed that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2012/aug/16/antidote-celebrities-promote-homeopathy">homeopathy</a> can be <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2014/08/01/homeopaths-and-ebola-virus-hemorrhagic-fever/">used to treat Ebola</a>, but there is no scientific evidence to support such a claim. This still applies if you replace “Ebola” with TB or Aids or influenza or bronchitis or Sars or bird flu or swine flu or rhinovirus or Legionnaires’ disease or Parkinson’s or Huntington’s or gout or athletes foot or gum disease or gallstones or ME or cerebral palsy or kidney stones or heatstroke or arrhythmia or hypotension or hypertension or basically anything that is inconsiderate enough to be an actual illness with a biological mechanism.</li> </ul> <p><em>Dean Burnett is best interacted with via the sterile environment of Twitter, </em><a href="https://twitter.com/garwboy"><em>@garwboy</em></a></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/06/ebola-liberia-health-funds-africa-summit <p>When my 65-year-old mother visited my foundation’s office recently, she was covered from head to toe in a long winter coat and headdress despite it being 28C. She explained that she wanted extra protection against the Ebola virus.</p> <p>As the outbreak worsened I urged my parents to leave Monrovia. But my mother, a vibrant and protective member of her community, refuses. She is the sole carer for my grandmother, a centenarian who is too frail and stubborn to travel. She stays because she loves her home and her community. She stays for Liberia.</p> <p>Last year, <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45662#.U-DTuS_6rW4" title="UN News Centre">Liberia celebrated the 10th anniversary </a>of the end of a long and bloody civil war. We proudly marked the milestone and were optimistic about the future. Half a generation of children have no memory of war. Businesses have grown, students attend schools, and many compatriots have returned home. When I travel internationally, I proudly display my Liberian passport. After the election of Africa’s first female president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/07/johnson-sirleaf-gbowee-karmen-nobel" title="The Guardian">2011 Nobel peace prize awards</a>, my country was famous for something other than child soldiers and a despot. The world recognised the pride we felt for our country.</p> <p>But now we face a new enemy from within. Liberia is battling a virulence that threatens to destroy all of our progress. The Ebola outbreak has closed all schools. Hospitals are overwhelmed, and two airlines have stopped flights to the country. Ebola is resurrecting old traumas for Liberians who survived the war. Those with the right passports are able to leave. Those with resources can buy soap and protective gear to keep safe. But people cannot conduct their business as usual. Children no longer attend classes, and many are shuttered inside their homes. My brave sisters, who protested along with me against the civil war, are back again. Clothed in white T-shirts, they gather together to pray for a reprieve and offer passersby water with which to wash their hands.</p> <p>The response to the crisis was initially underwhelming. Our healthcare providers lacked necessary supplies, such as gloves, masks and bleach to maintain basic standards of hygiene. This week’s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/us-africa-leaders-summit" title="">US-Africa Leaders Summit</a> – hosted by Barack Obama in Washington – underscores the point that Africa’s development is in every nation’s interest. But it is the needs at local level that worry me most.</p> <p>EBVEbola is dominating the few health resources in Liberia. Before the outbreak, Liberia had fewer than 300 doctors for a population of 3.5 million people. With so few doctors to care for Ebola victims, non-related ailments are overlooked. For children and the elderly, treatable diseases are much more deadly. For pregnant women, the few facilities for childbirth have narrowed.</p> <p>Last week, a family friend was turned away from the hospital. Her first child was delivered outside the maternity ward.</p> <p>A month ago, Saint Joseph’s Catholic Hospital in Monrovia welcomed with a fanfare a new ECG machine. Its director, Dr Patrick Nshamdze, caught the virus last month and died on Saturday. The hospital is now closed.</p> <p>People need direct funds to care for their families as the government scrambles to create a cohesive health response network where none existed before. The outbreak will end when individuals understand the disease and adopt safe and sanitary practices to feed and care for each other. My foundation organised two information sessions,, with a Ministry of Health official, for community groups from across Liberia to distribute posters and fund prevention and outreach efforts. Some groups drove up to eight hours to receive material. Since efforts at the macro level are flailing, Liberians must be vigilant with their own families and communities.</p> <p>This epidemic is rewriting how we care for one other. But we must also equip communities with the resources they need. A slapdash government response has aided Ebola’s spread . The purpose of the US-Africa Leaders Summit is to secure development funds for governments. Let’s also provide resources to the people who are most vulnerable to Ebola. Liberia has so much more to give to the world.</p> <p><em>Leymah Gbowee is a Liberian peace activist, president of the Gbowee Peace Foundation and a 2011 Nobel Peace Laureate</em></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/05/us-doctors-ebola-outbreak-patients-fear <p>The fear hit Dr William Fischer hardest in the four or five days before he set off. A clinician from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, he told the Guardian that when he wasn’t busy packing, he watched “gruesome” media portrayals of the Ebola outbreak he was going to fight. It consumed him. But when he arrived at Conakry, the capital of Guinea, West Africa, everything seemed rather low-key. Only a warning placard at passport control with “EBOLA” in frightening red letters hinted at what was to come.</p> <p>On 28 May, he received his marching orders from the World Health Organisation to head to Guéckédou, near the border with Sierra Leone and Liberia, in the south-west of Guinea, an area which he described as the epicenter of the outbreak. He sent a brief email to friends and family that said “I love you all.”</p> <p>The WHO said the number of confirmed cases of Ebola now stands at 1,603, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/doctor-nigeria-ebola-victim-lagos">of whom 887 have died</a>. Benoit Carpentier, the team leader for public communications at the International Red Cross, told the Guardian that there had never been an Ebola outbreak on this scale. “What makes it more complicated is that it’s a regional outbreak,” he said. “You have to coordinate in three countries.”</p> <p>The disease is currently spreading across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and there are now cases in neighbouring Nigeria. Fischer was called in as a consultant; his area of expertise is in clinical care in resource-scarce environments.</p> <p>Medical aid workers work on a roughly three-week rotation, which for Fischer meant a week of consultation and two weeks on the front line at a treatment facility run by Doctors Without Borders. The time limit, he said, is important. “It gets emotionally taxing. You need a break.”</p> <p>There are a range of aid organisations working in the area, including the World Health Organisation, Doctors Without Borders and the International Red Cross, as well as Christian aid organisations like Samaritan’s Purse, with which the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/05/ebola-nancy-writebol-aid-worker-atlanta-emory">two American missionaries</a> who have contracted the virus work.</p> <p>The Red Cross has had 2,400 people in the region since March, of which 70 were international medical staff and consultants and the rest locally employed medical and other staff. The WHO has deployed 428 people, including 170 “surge personnel”. Doctors Without Borders has over 500 people there.</p> <p>Guéckédou is in the middle of the bush, where clean water and electricity were limited. After the relative calm of Conakry, Fischer said that the fear and despair in the outbreak areas was palpable. All the personnel at the Guéckédou facility ate dinner together. “Dinner was the time people came together and talked about what was going on, would try to support each other,” Fischer said. “That’s key. When I missed dinner, those were tougher nights.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-d23b0aa1-57c2-412e-b5a6-5106a9b4b6ff"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/5/1407263774729/832cd997-ece5-451e-9466-7ad194c9fb73-460x276.jpeg" alt="Dr Kent Brantly Ebola" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Dr Kent Brantly, a US missionary who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia, wears protective gear. Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The clinical work is hard. Monia Sayah is a nurse who has worked full-time for Doctors Without Borders since 2012. Originally from France, she now lives in Brooklyn. She told the Guardian that doctors and nurses work 15 or 16 hours every day, seven days a week. When in the treatment facility they wear thick protective yellow impermeable suits, rubber boots and respirator masks, two pairs of rubber gloves, thick goggles and rubber full-length aprons to protect them from the disease.</p> <p>In the warm, humid climate, this gets extremely hot. One day, Fischer took a thermometer with him in his pocket to measure the temperature in his suit; it was 115 degrees. Dehydration or fainting from heat exhaustion are ever-present dangers; in a day, one person can lose as much as eight litres in sweat. Sayah said that when they de-robe, workers are drenched “like somebody’s poured a bucket of water on us”.</p> <p>Everyone has their own ways of coping. One group of hygienists – responsible for maintaining and applying the Personal Protective Equipment suits, commonly just called “PPEs” – were on a Celine Dion kick which, Fischer told friends, required “its own coping strategy”.</p> <p>Within the high-risk zone, the medical staff have protocols much like divers. “You make sure the other one is not going to make a mistake, or about to faint, or about to trip on something,” said Sayah. “And you keep track of how long you stay inside.”</p> <p>“We’re totally dependent on each other,” Fischer agreed. He said that the bravery and support from the patients inside the facility were also important: “The smiles, the thumbs-up.” He recalls one older patient doing callisthenics to show he was getting better. “That was an incredibly moving experience,” Fischer said. “That meant the world to me.”</p> <p>The American and international personnel are working alongside dedicated local doctors and staff. Fischer said the pressure-cooker environment brought people together. “There’s true friendships that have developed between us and local physicians,” he said. He said he is in touch regularly with people in Guinea by phone and email.</p> <p>Sayah, who returned from her latest tour of duty in Guinea last week, is also in frequent contact with friends back in Guéckédou. “When you’re in a bad place, you really need to talk to someone who’s going through the same thing,” she said. “Someone who has lived it. We get very close.” She plans to return as soon as she feels rested – in Brooklyn, while on leave, she fills her days with yoga and meditation to get her mind and body ready to go back.</p> <p>She said that one of the most difficult things to deal with out there is the stigma attached to the disease. “A lot of the time, the patient will not be truthful because they are afraid,” she told the Guardian. “They don’t want to come to the treatment facility.”</p> <p>“Even though we do a lot of education and information,” she continued, “sometimes it’s very hard to get the message across. They know that if they come, they might not come back.” In an email to friends back home, Fischer said that the fear is “almost as dangerous as the virus itself”. When a patient recovers, staff have to make sure it is safe to send them back to their village. Sometimes, recovered patients can be ostracised.</p> <p>The best moments, said Sayah, happen when a patient recovers. “It’s a celebration,” she said. “The people cleaning the floors, people who do the laundry for us, everyone, the nurse, the doctor – everyone is so happy.”</p> <p>When a patient succumbs to the disease it can be very difficult for everyone to bear. Traditionally, in the region, when someone is sick family members crowd around their bedside – they are never alone. This is partly why Ebola, which is most virulent in its final stages, spreads so quickly here. Whole families can be decimated.</p> <p>“You can see the fear, the desperation when they look at us,” said Sayah. “They can only see our eyes. They hold your hand and don’t want to let go. That’s really difficult, because when you’ve been inside for an hour, and you know you’ve reached your limit, or you’re about to faint, you have to let go of his hand and say, ‘I’ll be back.’”</p> <p>“It’s difficult,” she added, “because sometimes, when you’re back, it’s too late.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/soldiers-sierra-leone-liberia-ebola <p>Hundreds of soldiers have been deployed in Sierra Leone and Liberia in an attempt to quarantine the remote villages at the centre of the Ebola outbreak, as three new cases were discovered in Nigeria and authorities in Saudi Arabia said a man was being tested for suspected infection.</p><p>The Saudi health ministry said a man in his 40s who had recently returned from Sierra Leone had shown symptoms of viral haemorrhagic fever and was being treated at a specialist hospital in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. The patient is in isolation and blood samples are being tested.</p><p>As the epidemic entered its seventh month, 700 troops in Sierra Leone began setting up roadblocks to ensure that only health personnel could move in and out of the hardest-hit communities. They include two eastern districts where health workers have sometimes been attacked by residents who fear that treatment centres are causing Ebola to spread.</p><p>Military spokesperson Yayah Brima said food and medical supplies would be ferried in by convoys, and 50 military nurses would provide medical assistance to the soldiers.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-443908206'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/6/1407325517770/Ebola-victim-Nancy-Writeb-010.jpg' alt='Ebola victim Nancy Writebol ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Nancy Writebol, an aid worker from North Carolina, who was infected with Ebola in west Africa, arrives at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, US.\r\n Photograph: Sipa USA/Rex</figcaption></figure><p>Poor enforcement and medical practices in remote areas, combined with high volumes of cross-border travel, have fuelled the outbreak, which has so far claimed 887 lives. Ebola is spread through contact with the bodily fluids of infected patients, bush meat and surfaces.</p><p>"Border controls alone give a false sense of security," said David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who oversaw the global response to the Sars outbreak in 2003. "You cannot keep Ebola out using only that because people can still get to places where there aren't controls."</p><p>Alongside contact-tracing, he said, "the best defence is properly understanding how it is spread, stopping it spreading further, and making sure health workers are able to self protect with up-to-par hospital controls."</p><p>Efforts to contain the outbreak have been hampered as those on the frontline have been among the hardest hit. Both Liberia and Sierra Leone's top Ebola doctors died last month. Clinics in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, were closing their doors because doctors were too afraid to treat patients, Reuters reported.</p><p>British Airways has suspended flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone until the end of August to help try to contain the virus. The airline had been flying four times a week to the two countries. BA said customers with tickets on those routes were being offered refunds or the option to rebook flights for a later date.</p><p>"The safety of our customers, crew and ground teams is always our top priority and we will keep the route under constant review in the coming weeks," BA said.</p><p>In Nigeria, a doctor who treated a Liberian-American man who had travelled from Monrovia has contracted the virus, and another health worker and a third citizen who had travelled the Guinea are displaying probable signs of haemorrhagic fever, the World Health Organisation said.</p><p>A morgue in Nigeria's southern state of Anambra has been sealed while tests are carried out on a deceased person, said the health minister Onyebuchi Chukwu.</p><p>Enuka Egbon, a fruit trader in the Lagos district where eight people are being held in an isolation ward after coming into contact with the Liberian-American victim, said: "It's really scary because we have no choice but to keep going out and keep using crowded buses and shopping in markets. And Lagos is a city where there is very little breathing space."</p><p>Meanwhile, two US volunteer doctors who contracted the disease arrived in the US, where they are being treated with an experimental serum. Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly of the charity Samaritan's Purse were said to be critical but improving after using the serum, which has been tested only on monkeys.</p><p>"Within an hour of receiving the medication, Brantly's condition was nearly reversed. His breathing improved; the rash over his trunk faded away," CNN reported, citing sources involved in the pair's treatment.</p><p>Last week the WHO said the outbreak had reached a critical point, and announced a $200m (£120m) emergency fund. On the last day of July, the latest day for which statistics are available, 163 new cases were reported, the WHO said.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/05/ebola-worrying-disease <p>A deadly disease is set to hit the shores of the US, UK and much of the rest of the northern hemisphere in the coming months. It will swamp our hospitals, lay millions low and by this time next year between <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/">250,000 and 500,000 worldwide </a> will be dead, thousands of them in the US and Britain.</p> <p>Despite the best efforts of the medical profession, there’s no reliable cure, and no available vaccine offers effective protection for longer than a few months at a time.</p> <p>If you’ve been paying attention to recent, terrifying headlines, you may assume the illness is the Ebola virus. Instead, the above description refers to seasonal flu – not swine or bird flu, but regular garden variety influenza.</p> <p>Our fears about illness often bear little relation to our chances of falling victim to it, a phenomenon not helped by media coverage, which tends towards the novel and lurid rather than the particularly dangerous.</p> <p>Ebola has become the stuff of hypochondriacs’ nightmares across the world. In the UK, the Daily Mirror had “<a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/496055560891293697">Ebola terror as passenger dies at Gatwick</a>” (the patient didn’t have Ebola), while New York’s news outlets (and prominent tweeters) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/05/ebola-not-in-the-city-how-the-new-york-tabloids-covered-manhattans-brief-ebola-panic/">experienced their own Ebola scare</a>.</p> <p>Even intellectual powerhouses such as Donald Trump have fallen into panic, with the mogul calling for the US to shut off all travel to west Africa and revoke citizens’ right to return to the country – who cares about fundamental rights during an outbreak? Not to be outdone, the endlessly asinine “explanatory journalism” site Vox informed us that “<a href="https://twitter.com/edyong209/status/496629620998172672">If the supercontinent Pangaea</a> spontaneously reunited, the US would border the Ebola epidemic”.</p> <p>Ebola is a horrific disease that kills more than half of people infected by it, though with specialist western treatment that death rate would likely fall a little. It’s unsurprising that the prospect of catching it is a scary one. The relief is that it’s not all that infectious: direct contact with bodily fluids of a visibly infected person is required, meaning that, compared with many illnesses, it’s easily contained.</p> <p>Even in the midst of the current outbreak – the worst ever – the spread of the disease has not been rapid in west Africa: around 400 new cases were reported in June, and a further 500 or so in July. This is a linear spread, meaning each person at present is infecting on average around (actually just over) one additional person.</p> <p>Far more worrying are diseases that spread exponentially: if one infected person spreads the disease to two or more on average, the illness spreads far quicker and is a much more worrying prospect, even if mortality is considerably lower.</p> <p>The 800-plus deaths from Ebola in Africa so far this year are indisputably tragic, but it is important to keep a sense of proportion – other infectious diseases are far, far deadlier.</p> <p>Since the Ebola outbreak began in February, around 300,000 people have died <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/">from malaria</a>, while <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/">tuberculosis</a> has likely claimed over 600,000 lives. Ebola might have our attention, but it’s not even close to being the biggest problem in Africa right now. Even <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/lassafever/en/">Lassa fever</a>, which shares many of the terrifying symptoms of Ebola (including bleeding from the eyelids), kills many more than Ebola – and frequently <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/p0404-lassa-fever.html">finds its way to the US</a>.</p> <p>The most real effect for millions of people reading about Ebola will be fear and stigma. During the Sars outbreak of 2003, Asian-Americans became the targets of just that, with public health hotlines inundated with calls from Americans worried about “buying Asian merchandise”, “living near Asians”, “going to school with Asians”, and more.</p> <p>Similarly, during the H1N1 “swine flu” outbreak, which had almost identical spread and mortality to seasonal flu, patients reported extreme fear, prompted largely by the hysterical <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673610608628/fulltext">coverage</a>.</p> <p>In the coming months, almost none of us will catch the Ebola virus. Many of us, though, will get fevers, headaches, shivers and more.</p> <p>As planes get grounded, communities are stigmatised, and mildly sick people fear for their lives, it’s worth reflecting what the biggest threat to our collective wellbeing is: rare tropical diseases, or our terrible coverage of them.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/05/ebola-nancy-writebol-aid-worker-atlanta-emory <p>A second American aid worker infected with the deadly Ebola virus while responding to the outbreak in west Africa arrived in the US on Tuesday. </p> <p>A specially equipped plane carrying 59-year-old Nancy Writebol took off from the airport in Liberia’s capital, Monrovia, late on Monday night. The plane made a refuelling stop in Maine before arriving in Atlanta on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>Writebol was wheeled from ambulance to hospital on stretcher. She will be treated at Atlanta’s Emory University in a sophisticated isolation unit along with fellow aid worker Dr Kent Brantly.</p> <p>Brantly and Writebol contracted Ebola while working in Liberia for a North Carolina-based evangelical Christian group, Samaritan’s Purse.</p> <p>Writebol had been working as a hygienist, decontaminating those entering and leaving the isolation ward at a hospital in Monrovia, Samaritan’s Purse said on its website.</p> <p>Brantly arrived in the US over the weekend, and was taken to the Atlanta hospital’s isolation unit, which is said to be among the best in the country. On Sunday, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr Thomas Frieden, said Brantly’s condition <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/03/condition-ebola-infected-us-doctor-improved-hospital">had improved</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/01/guinea-ebola-outbreak-whats-being-done-explained">Ebola virus</a> has killed at least 887 people <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/doctor-nigeria-ebola-victim-lagos">across three west African countries</a>, in which there have been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/doctor-nigeria-ebola-victim-lagos">more than 1,300 reported infections</a>.

Brantly and Writebol, however, are being treated with an experimental drug that has never before been tested for safety in humans.</p> <p>Meanwhile, doctors at Mount Sinai hospital in New York City say they are running tests on a man who had recently traveled to “a west African country where Ebola has been reported”.</p> <p>“Odds are this is not Ebola,” said Dr Jeremy Boal, chief medical officer of the Mount Sinai Health System, speaking at a press conference on Monday. “It’s much more likely that it’s a much more common condition.”</p> <p>On Tuesday, the hospital said in a statement that the patient’s samples have been sent to the CDC in Atlanta for testing, which typically takes 24-48 hours to complete.<br /></p> <p>“The patient, who remains in isolation, was stable overnight and in good spirits,” the statement said. “No other patients have presented with similar symptoms and travel history to West Africa. We will continue to work closely with federal, state and city health officials to address and monitor this case, keep the community informed and provide the best quality care to all of our patients.”</p> <p>The man arrived at the hospital’s emergency room in the early morning hours on Monday complaining of a high fever and gastrointestinal problems, doctors said.

A doctor in Nigeria also <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/doctor-nigeria-ebola-victim-lagos">contracted the virus</a>. <br /></p> <p>Amid the outbreak, dozens of African heads of state are arriving in Washington on Monday, the start of a three-day summit led by President Barack Obama. The leaders of Liberia and Sierra Leone –<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/31/ebola-africa-west-ethics-vaccine-drug-testing"> two of the three affected countries</a> – have cancelled plans to attend in order to deal with the Ebola outbreak in their countries. Guinea’s president Alpha Condé is <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/us-africa-leaders-summit#section-more-info">expected</a> to attend.</p> <p>Obama said ahead of the summit the administration is taking “appropriate precautions”, including medical screenings in necessary circumstances. </p> <p>Ebola is not an airborne virus that can be spread by sneezing or coughing. Rather, the virus can only be spread through direct contact with bodily fluids from an infected person.</p> <p>Doctors and health officials are doing their best to allay public fears of an Ebola outbreak in the US. </p> <p>Dr Bruce Ribner, an infectious disease specialist at Emory who will treat the patients, said there is very little risk of the virus spreading in western healthcare settings.</p> <p>“The bottom line is we have an inordinate amount of safety associated with the care of these patients and we do not believe any healthcare worker, any patient or any visitor to our facility is in any way at risk for this infection,” Ribner said speaking at a news conference on Friday.</p> <p>There is no known cure for Ebola. Doctors can only provide support to the patients as the body fights the virus by monitoring blood pressure, keeping them hydrated and easing their symptoms.</p> <p>Some experimental treatments exist, but have not been approved for use on humans. Canada’s Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp, which is working to produce a first-of-its-kind treatment for the virus, quashed rumors that its drug was used to treat the two recently-infected US humanitarian workers. </p> <p>The company told the<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/business/story/1.2726740"> Canadian Press</a> that its drug, TKM-Ebola, was not given to the US patients “or anyone else infected in the current outbreak, and has not been given to anyone outside of our Phase I trials”.</p> <p>Symptoms of Ebola include fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea and, in some cases, internal and external bleeding.</p> <p>The US doctor infected with Ebola arrived in Atlanta on Saturday and was immediately taken to Emory’s specially-equipped infectious disease unit, which is said to be among the best in the country. On Sunday, the director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr Thomas Frieden, said Brantly’s condition <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/03/condition-ebola-infected-us-doctor-improved-hospital">had improved</a>.</p> <p>Brantly’s wife, Amber, said in an online <a href="http://www.samaritanspurse.org/article/brantly-family-statement/">statement</a> on Sunday: “Our family is rejoicing over Kent’s safe arrival, and we are confident that he is receiving the very best care.”<br /></p> <p>She added that her husband, who was able to walk out of the ambulance unassisted when he arrived at the hospital, is in “good spirits”.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/doctor-nigeria-ebola-victim-lagos <p>A doctor who treated Nigeria's first Ebola victim has himself contracted the deadly virus, raising fears that the seven-month-long epidemic in three west African nations could spread in the continent's most populous nation.</p><p>The doctor was part of a team that attended to Patrick Sawyer, a 40-year-old Liberian-American civil servant who collapsed on arrival at Lagos airport last month. Sawyer had flown from Liberia's capital, Monrovia, with flight stopovers in nearby Ghana and Togo.</p><p>"As at today, one of the doctors that treated the late Mr Sawyer has tested positive to the Ebola virus," the health minister Onyebuchi Chukwu told reporters in the capital, Abuja. Officials said they had identified 70 people with whom Sawyer had been in contact, eight of whom had been transferred to isolation wards in Lagos.</p><p>The epidemic has killed 887 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. The three country's leaders held a regional crisis summit in Guinea's capital, Conakry, last week.</p><p>The World Health Organisation said the outbreak was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/01/ebola-outbreak-world-health-organisation-chief" title="">moving faster than efforts to control it</a>, and warned that the more people were infected, the greater the risk of the virus evolving into deadlier mutations.</p><p>Authorities in Lagos have rapidly rolled out a series of preventive measures, including quarantining the hospital where Sawyer was treated, distributing protective clothing to health workers and screening airport and seaport passengers arriving from at-risk countries.</p><p>Information about the virus has been widely broadcast on radio stations, and some traders have begun cashing in with the sale of hand sanitiser branded "Ebola cleansing hand gels". In the downtown business district where Sawyer was treated, a handful of traders could be seen wearing face masks.</p><p>On Sunday, health officials visited the church of the "super-pastor" <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/lagos-businesses-superpastor-joshua" title="">TB Joshua</a>, which attracts 50,000 worshippers weekly. "We asked that the church leadership be aware of the important role they have to play in preventing Ebola from spreading," a member of the delegation told the Guardian. "Also we warned that they do not hold 'healing sessions' as we are concerned Ebola sufferers might travel from outside the country to the church."</p><p>Attempts to contain the disease were hampered in Liberia and Sierra Leone as faith healers and crowded churches sheltered Ebola victims whom they claimed to be able to cure. Both countries eventually made such action a crime punishable with jail terms.</p><p>Passed on through contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, surfaces and bush meat, Ebola has no known cure, although chances of survival improve dramatically with early detection and treatment. It is contagious only once symptoms begin showing and can rapidly degenerate into external and internal bleeding.</p><p>The epidemic is already having an impact on Nigeria. A South Korean university <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/04/ebola-outbreak-south-korea-bars-nigerians-from-university-conference" title="">banned three Nigerian students</a> from attending a summit, and a Nigerian delegation attending a US-Africa summit is believed to have been screened on arrival in Washington.</p><p>Elsewhere, health workers and officials said they had been overwhelmed by the spiralling death toll amid a shortage of resources. The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontiers said there were critical gaps in tackling the epidemic.</p><p>"The current response to the Ebola outbreak is entirely insufficient compared to the needs, and there needs to be greater mobilisation on the ground. MSF does not have a clear overview of the most affected areas and it is believed that people are still dying in their villages without access to medical care," the organisation said on Friday.</p><p>The US said it was sending a team of 50 specialists to the region this week. The British Red Cross has launched an <a href="http://www.redcross.org.uk/ebolavirus" title="">appeal</a> to raise funds. The WHO has set up a $100m (£60m) fund to boost a regional emergency response.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/04/ebola-public-discourse-xenophobia-midwives-nigeria <p>Like Sars and swine flu before it, Ebola has gripped the national imagination. I was made all too aware of this last week on my return to London from a holiday in Nigeria.</p> <p>I’m now two thirds of the way through my second pregnancy, and was due to have a routine midwife’s appointment the day after my flight landed at Heathrow. The only problem was that my midwives refused to see me. They took this precaution as a result of two factors – my poorly toddler, who had a slight temperature, and heavy news coverage of the Ebola outbreak in west Africa. They referred me instead to my GP. Their wisdom was debatable. I was travelling from Nigeria, a country in which so far only two people have been quarantined as a result of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/25/first-case-ebola-lagos-nigeria" title="">possible contact with the disease</a>. And in any case, a GP’s waiting room is not the best place to take a potentially deadly virus. Thank goodness I’m not infected.</p> <p>Faced with the possibility of Ebola, my midwife was overly cautious. It’s a reaction I can understand, so I’m not inclined to judge or diminish it. Media coverage of the outbreak, however, doesn’t deserve the same reticence. In the press, communities dealing with the virus have been presented as irrationally suspicious of western medicine. The suggestion has been that they are, like the continent they live on, their own worst enemies.</p> <p>Reporting should do more than repeat stale narratives of African “ignorance”; frontline health workers have exposed themselves to huge risk. The fact that remote west African communities may view medics with suspicion is therefore understandable. Fear and mistrust of western institutions might also be explicable in the context of a history of exploitation by multinationals and colonial governments alike.</p> <p>Decontextualising the suspicion some people might display runs the risk of projecting “the image of Africa as ‘the other world’, the antithesis of Europe and therefore of civilisation”. This was Chinua Achebe’s searing critique of Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness in 1975. You don’t have to look too far to see the resonances today. The Sunday Times invoked Conrad’s novel with the front page headline, “<a href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/article1442391.ece" title="">Ebola doctor’s diary of hell in heart of Africa</a>”, and, served up with breakfast or brunch, these stories act as a stark reminder of how vulnerable the trappings of our wealth and modernity are in the face of Africa’s diseased hordes.</p> <p>This fear isn’t unlike those expressed by the anti-immigration brigade. Arguing that too much immigration “threatens” the stability of our fragile society, we allow “them” in at our peril. It’s not surprising then that the spotlight on Ebola has begun to stir latent anti-immigration sentiments. From being just an occasional feature in the news, part of the background noise of our busy lives, the virus has become a palpable reality – perhaps only hours away from each of us.</p> <p>In April the Facebook status of <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/theres-no-ebola-outbreak-in-italy" title="">Italian anti-immigration group</a>, Catena Umana (Human Chain) read: “Stop all arrivals, close all borders or keep [the migrants] in quarantine on the sea. Do you want to give the citizenship to Ebola as well?”</p> <p>Last month <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-congressman-ebola-spreading-across-border" title="">Republican Phil Gingrey</a>, speaking of Mexican immigrants primarily as a public health risk, raised the spectre of the deadly virus. In an impassioned letter to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Gingrey referred to unsubstantiated “reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus and tuberculosis”.</p> <p>Irrespective of location, the stigma of Ebola can be attached to any unwanted migrant group. In the UK, the comments left beneath articles on the subject often reflect the prevailing anti-immigration climate – except now they are presented within the framework of science and public health; the best way to stop it reaching us is to look at how we can stop more of them getting in. Rather than being focused on the desperate reality of communities who are living with the virus, our attention has been drawn inwards, towards ourselves. How will it affect us? In what ways are we in danger?</p> <p>Four months ago Ebola looked like yet another far-off possibility not worth worrying about. The disease’s quiet rampage in the distant forests of west Africa went largely unnoticed. It is only now, with the possibility of Ebola reaching us via the next flight in, that we realise how interconnected we are. In the age of diaspora and globalisation, it is ridiculous to think that we are, or could be, a fortress.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/03/condition-ebola-infected-us-doctor-improved-hospital <p>Dr Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said on Sunday the American doctor who contracted Ebola in West Africa seemed to have improved.</p> <p>Dr Frieden, who was making media appearances in an effort to reassure a public worried by press reports and speculation over <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/01/ebola-outbreak-world-health-organisation-chief">the West African outbreak</a>, the worst ever, told NBC’s Meet the Press talk show it was encouraging to see Dr Kent Brantly <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/02/us-ebola-victims-facility-atlanta-emory-university">walk out of an ambulance unassisted</a> when he arrived at Atlanta’s Emory University hospital from Liberia on Saturday.</p> <p>“Ebola can be deadly,” he said, “but for people who are healthy like this doctor, the fatality rate may be lower than those usually quoted.”</p> <p>Asked if enough precautions had been taken, and if Brantly’s return represented an unacceptable risk to the US, Frieden said: “He was coming home, and the organisation that sent him to Africa made the decision to bring him home. </p> <p>“He’s an American citizen, and what our role is in public health is to make sure that if an American is coming home with an infectious disease we protect so it doesn’t spread. That was what we did in transit and at the hospital.”</p> <p>Brantly, from Texas, is the first of two US aid workers to be flown back to the country; Nancy Writebol, a missionary from South Carolina who worked for the same charity in Liberia, Samaritan’s Purse, is due to follow on the same specially adapted private jet.</p> <p>Liberia’s information minister said on Sunday Writebol would arrive back in the US early on Tuesday. Lewis Brown said the second evacuation flight was expected to leave West Africa between at 1am and 1.30am that day.</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/30/ebola-in-west-africa-the-outbreak-country-by-country">Ebola outbreak</a> has so far mainly affected three West African countries: Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. More than 700 people have died; the disease has also been reported in Nigeria.<br /></p> <p>“What we’re doing at CDC is surging our response,” said Frieden on Sunday. “We are going to put at least 50 public health experts in this region in the next 30 days because actually we do know how to stop Ebola.”</p> <p>Frieden said old-fashioned practices were required to stop the spread of Ebola in West Africa. That meant finding the patients and their contacts, making sure they were treated, educating the public and doing rigorous infection control in hospitals.</p> <p>Ebola is not an airborne disease, and is only spread through direct contact with bodily fluids.</p> <p>On Saturday, Brantly was driven to the hospital from a military airbase in an ambulance escorted by police. He stepped down from the ambulance in full protective clothing – another figure in such clothing led him into the building. Brantly is now being cared for in an advanced isolation ward.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-c121543c-63bc-4a45-a3df-9d9be7d87031"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/3/1407077185734/646ae427-c2e7-46da-b09b-204c1319224d-460x276.jpeg" alt="ebola kent brantly" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">An ambulance arrives with Ebola victim Dr Kent Brantly, right, to Emory University hospital on Saturday.

The Associated Press interviewed members of the public around the Atlanta hospital. One such interviewee, Ashley Wheeler, said: “I just think it’s a blessing that we can help possibly make the infected person’s life a little more tolerable.</p> <p>“If I were that person I would want my country to help me the best way they could.”</p> <p>Brantly’s wife, Amber, issued a statement in which she said: “It was a relief to welcome Kent home today. I spoke with him, and he is glad to be back in the US. I am thankful to God for his safe transport and for giving him the strength to walk into the hospital.”</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/01/ebola-no-threat-commonwealth-games <p>The organisers of the Commonwealth Games said on Friday that there was no threat to the athletes' village from the Ebola virus, after it emerged that a competitor from Sierra Leone had been tested in Glasgow for the deadly infection.</p><p>"There is no Ebola in the athletes' village," Glasgow 2014 spokeswoman Jackie Brock-Doyle said. "There is no Ebola in Scotland." Moses Sesay, a cyclist in the Sierra Leonean squad, had been tested for Ebola among a number of other viruses after falling ill last week, the organisation said, but the results had been negative and he had competed as expected in Thursday's individual time trial event.</p><p>The west African country is one of a number currently affected by the most deadly outbreak of the disease to date, which the director of the World Health Organisation said on Friday was "moving faster than efforts to control it".</p><p>There was some confusion about a second athlete from the country, after Sierra Leone's chef de mission at the Games told the Daily Telegraph that another cyclist, Mohamed Tholley, had failed to compete in the same event and had possibly absconded. "The situation is very serious at home, and it is possible this is why he does not want to return," the paper quoted Unisa Deen Kargbo as saying.</p><p>But Brock-Doyle later said the organisers were not alarmed. "We have now contacted the chef de mission and asked if they are concerned about the welfare of this athlete, has he gone missing, and whether they would like us to help, and they have said they are not concerned about the welfare or whereabouts of this athlete."</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/01/ebola-infected-americans-evacuated-liberia <p>Emory University hospital in Atlanta is set to receive two US humanitarian aid workers infected with the deadly Ebola virus that has claimed <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/01/ebola-outbreak-world-health-organisation-chief">more than 700 lives in west Africa</a>, officials announced during a press conference on Friday.</p> <p>Dr Kent Brantly of Texas and Nancy Writebol, a missionary from North Carolina, contracted Ebola while responding to the outbreak in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/liberia">Liberia</a>. The patients remain in serious condition, but the hospital said both are “safe to transport”.</p> <p>Dr Bruce Ribner, who will treat both Brantly and Writebol, said the facility was designed with help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is headquartered in Atlanta, and was developed specifically to care for patients with serious communicable diseases. According to Ribner, the hospital is one of only four institutions in the US capable of properly handling patients with a disease of this nature.</p> <p>“The reason we are bringing these patients back to our facility is because we feel they deserve to have the highest level of care offered,” Ribner said. He stressed that every effort was being made to protect staff, patients and other visitors from the virus.</p> <p>Ribner said that he believes the two Americans are the first Ebola patients ever treated in the US.</p> <p>Speaking during a press conference Friday, President Barack Obama said his administration is taking the Ebola outbreak “very seriously,” and that “the appropriate precautions” are being taken ahead of next week’s US-Africa summit in Washington.</p> <p>“Folks who are coming from these countries that have even a marginal risk or an infinitesimal risk of having been exposed in some fashion, we’re making sure we’re doing screening on that end as they leave the country. We’ll do additional screening when they’re here,” Obama said.</p> <p>In a statement, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the US is working to secure the safe evacuations of Brantly and Writebol.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-3991a3cd-45de-45d6-8951-de8156ac022c"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/1/1406925469629/b7c6badc-6c94-4c9e-83bd-9a86f2e8e2a3-460x276.jpeg" alt="Dr Kent Brantly" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Dr Kent Brantly contracted Ebola and has been described as stable but suffering from some symptoms of the contagious disease.Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The safety and security of US citizens is our paramount concern. Every precaution is being taken to move the patients safely and securely, to provide critical care en route on a non-commercial aircraft, and to maintain strict isolation upon arrival in the United States,” Harf said.</p> <p>The Associated Press is reporting that a private jet has been dispatched from Atlanta to Liberia to retrieve the patients. The small jet, which has been outfitted to accommodate passengers who have been exposed to certain serious infectious diseases, can only carry one person at a time, the news agency said.</p> <p>The State Department said the evacuations would take place “over the coming days”.</p> <p>Amber Brantly, the doctor’s wife, said in a <a href="http://www.samaritanspurse.org/article/brantly-family-statement/">statement</a> that she is grateful for the outpouring of support her family has received since it was announced her husband had been infected with the virus.</p> <p>“I remain hopeful and believing that Kent will be healed from this dreadful disease,” she said.</p> <p>The virus, which has no known cure, has reportedly killed more than 700 people during the current outbreak, in which there have been more than 1,300 confirmed, probable or suspected cases across three west African countries.</p> <p>The disease has a case fatality rate of up to <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/">90%</a>, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Symptoms of the disease include vomiting, diarrhoea and in some cases internal and external bleeding.</p> <p>Liberia and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/sierraleone">Sierra Leone</a> have declared <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/31/ebola-outbreak-state-of-emergency-liberia-sierra-leone">states of emergency</a>, closing schools and markets in an attempt to stop the spread of the deadly virus.</p> <p>The US Peace Corps <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/31/us-peace-corps-evacuation-ebola-west-africa">has pulled all personnel</a> from the three countries – Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia – where the virus has broken out, and US health officials have warned Americans not to travel to those countries.</p> <p>• This story was amended on 4 August 2014 to correct the location of the CDC’s headquarters, which are in Atlanta, Georgia. </p>

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/01/guardian-view-ebola-need-new-drugs <p>Sometime towards the end of the 14th century, the <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n11/joyce-chaplin/bedbugs-and-broomsticks" title="">republic of Ragusa</a>, now Dubrovnik, introduced a new law. No ship could land its cargo until <a href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/9/1071.full" title="">a period of 30 days</a> had elapsed. The measure was intended to prevent the spread of a new plague, the black death. Extended to 40 days, the law became known as quarantine. Long before Sir Tim Berners-Lee conceived the worldwide web and created the opportunity for the digital virus, disease – tracking the development of trade – was forming networks that linked host to host through cargoes of silk or wool in a chain of death and prosperity. Disease networks, like their digital counterparts, are disruptive. They challenge the normal mechanisms by which a state protects its citizens: they demand a global response.</p> <p>Until the American historian William McNeill wrote about it in the 1970s, the connection between disease, demographic change and the fate of nations was not well understood. Now most historians accept that <a href="http://magazine.uchicago.edu/1008/features/a-germ-of-an-idea.shtml" title="">Athens might after all have defeated Sparta</a> in the Peloponnesian war had a quarter of its army not been wiped out by plague. Six hundred years later, the long decline of the Roman empire began, arguably, in the second century AD with the Antonine plague. The consequences of the Aids epidemic in Africa are thought still to be <a href="http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story051/en/" title="">reducing growth by 1%</a> a year. The last Labour government <a href="http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/finance/swine-flu-preparations-cost-1bn/5010530.article#.U9vARYBhsWA" title="">spent £1bn</a> preparing for the threat of a swine flu pandemic.</p> <p>The fear of epidemic retains its capacity to transfix the world. The deadly mutating viral disease has become the staple of Hollywood horror. A real epidemic is all the more arresting, particularly if it comes with nightmare symptoms and often fatal effects, like <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/ebola" title="">the viral disease Ebola</a> that flared again in Guinea in February and has so far claimed more than 700 lives.</p> <p>The fear of epidemic and the epidemic itself need to be disentangled. Ebola, for example, is relatively hard to catch. Unlike, say, the respiratory illness Sars which is highly contagious even when its symptoms are indistinguishable from mild flu, <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_07_31_ebola/en/" title="">Ebola</a> is only spread by contact with bodily fluids. That generally happens when the patient is already probably too ill to fly, for example, limiting the risk of contagion. And even in rural west Africa, where it has taken hold with a previously unknown intensity, there have still been only about 1,300 cases in five months. So far, about half its victims are known to have died, a much lower rate than the 90% experienced in earlier outbreaks.</p> <p>There is rightly an international effort to help the victims of Ebola in medical centres near the affected zones. That means overcoming local suspicion of foreign doctors, and tackling religious and cultural traditions of death and burial that risk spreading infection. It also means investing in research for an antidote for a disease that is not an obvious threat outside west Africa. Ebola is one of many neglected tropical diseases that sap the economic potential of the continent but do not offer enough incentive to companies with the necessary research expertise.</p> <p>Deadly viruses challenge convention everywhere. The global authorisation regime for novel drugs is, rightly, extremely tightly drawn. But many of these newer viral infections are so lethal and kill their victims so fast that the epidemic peaks and subsides before a drug treatment can be rolled out. The innovative solution put forward by <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Education-resources/Education-and-learning/Resources/Drug-development/index.htm" title="">the Wellcome Trust</a> is to change the protocol so that a new drug, if it had passed the earlier phases of safety and efficacy, could be used in the course of a real epidemic without the normal phase 2 trials on humans. That would require a big leap in trust. For that reason alone, trialling a new drug during an epidemic in Africa would look damagingly exploitative. But it may be that the most sensible response to the Ebola outbreak there is to prepare new protocols to fight every virus faster and more vigorously here.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/01/ebola-outbreak-world-health-organisation-chief <p>This week, Awa Faye added a new feature to her restaurant on a crowded street in Sierra Leone's hilly capital of Freetown: a sign that instructs all patrons to wash their hands in the buckets of chlorinated water positioned outside. "I don't allow anybody inside if they don't wash your hands. We're all trying to protect ourselves from Ebola one way or another," said the 55-year old, who put the sign up after learning that the country's top Ebola doctor had died on Tuesday.</p><p>Over in neighbouring Liberia, residents in the capital Monrovia have also been placing "Ebola buckets" outside offices, restaurants and homes. In Guinea, the prices of hand sanitiser and rubber gloves have soared.</p><p>Initially focusing battling misinformation and mistrust, the effort to curb the world's biggest outbreak of Ebola, now spread across three nations, has shifted its emphasis to treating the  number of cases coming forward, and finding those who have come into contact with victims of the highly contagious virus.</p><p>As Sierra Leone and Liberia <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/31/ebola-outbreak-state-of-emergency-liberia-sierra-leone" title="">declared states of emergency</a> this week, a summit between the presidents of all three countries and the World Health Organisation underlined a renewed sense of urgency over the largest ever epidemic of the disease, which has so far claimed 729 lives.</p><p>"This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it," Margaret Chan, head of the global health body, said on Friday following a crisis meeting in Guinea's capital of Conakry.</p><p>"If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives but also severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries."</p><p>Chan added that the longer the virus circulated, the more it became a public risk: "Constant mutation and adaptation are the survival mechanisms of viruses and other microbes. We must not give this virus opportunities to deliver more surprises."</p><p>WHO said the summit "must mark a turning point". A $100m fund will be used to back an emergency plan by all three countries.</p><p>Guinea ranked last in a 2011 World Bank study of beds per capita, and Liberia and Sierra Leone are both recovering from almost two decades of uninterrupted civil war. The already weak health services are over stretched and have struggled to cope.</p><p>Spread through contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, bush meat or surfaces, Ebola has no known cure or vaccine, although early detection gives a greater chance of survival. Symptoms may take up to 21 days to appear.</p><p>In Guinea, where the outbreak started, cases have now been confined to the forested interior region. But health officials there said new hotspots have flared up, fuelled by cross-border trade and family ties.</p><p>"Yesterday we had a case of a man who fell ill while in Liberia. He came back home to Macenta [the disease epicentre] so his family could look after him. They took him to hospital thinking it was malaria, and only there discovered it was in fact Ebola," said Sakouba Keita, the ministry of health official directing the country's Ebola response.</p><p>Bah Mamdou, a taxi driver in the frontier town of Nzérékoré, said he had to continue plying his trade across the border to earn an income. "The way I see it, either I die of starvation or I die of Ebola. I won't take any passengers that have the symptoms but in most cases it's malaria," whose early symptoms mimic those of Ebola, and kill thousands each year.</p><p>The response has been further hampered as NGOs have steadily reduced support staff in the affected countries. They include WaterAid and Samaritan's Purse, a medical charity where two US doctors have contracted the disease. "My gut instinct is that it's going to get worse before it gets better, and we can't afford to take those risks anymore," the director of another organisation told The Guardian.</p><p>"If you leave behind even one burning ember, one case undetected, it could reignite the epidemic," Thomas Frieden, director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters this week. He said the situation could take three to six months to bring under control. "CDC along with others are surging to begin to turn the tide.  It's not going to be quick.  It's not going to be easy.  But we know what to do _ so difficult as it is, it can be done"</p><p>The CDC said it would send a further 50 specialists to boost the several dozen more expected from the World Health Organisation.</p><p>In a region with communities are interlinked across porous borders, other countries are already tightening preventative measures. Nigerian officials began screening airport and seaport passengers this week after a Liberian man who collapsed in Lagos airport was later confirmed to have died of Ebola.</p><p>Further west, Ivory Coast set up four "surveillance posts" equipped with epidemiologists along its western border, where many maintain strong ties with Liberia. "For now we're on red alert, and we haven't ruled out closing our borders. We're obviously concerned and doing everything possible to prevent its spread," government spokesperson Bruno Kone said. Four women have been arrested for illegally selling bush meat in Yamoussoukro, the country's capital located near the centre, he added.</p><p>Health officials in Germany and France have advised against non-essential travel to the three affected nations, and the outbreak has had unexpected effects beyond its borders. A military spokesperson for the African Union said it had cancelled a Sierra Leonean battalion rotation to Somalia, where the organisation is battling Al-Shabab Islamists.</p>

Remote border officials say they've recently begun turning away people fleeing from affected communities.

Health officials there were requesting training, it added.</p><p>"It's a dire situation. The spread is overwhelming health workers and facilities. We need all the help and support we can get from the international community," said Lewis Brown, Liberia's information minister. He said communities hit hardest would be quarantined for as long as necessary by security forces. "It's an emergency, so we hope people will understand."</p><p>Sierra Leone's president, Ernest Bai Koroma, said the state of emergency would last between 60 and 90 days. House-to-house searches to trace victims will be conducted and new at-risk neighbourhoods will be placed under quarantine if necessary.</p><p>A nationwide hunt was sparked in the capital, Freetown, when a patient was forcibly removed from hospital last week.

Those on the frontlines have been among the hardest hit by the disease, which has claimed the lives of Liberia and Sierra Leone's most experienced Ebola doctors.</p><p>There are signs that some public awareness campaigns are yielding results. Doctors were forced to turn patients away at one of Liberia's main Ebola isolation wards in a sign many were belatedly coming forward. Some residents in the capital, Monrovia, initially protested against a new ward being set up, fearing it would endanger them.</p><p>Sylvia Johnson, a Monrovia resident, pulled her grandson out of summer school at the beginning of the week after seeing a government poster of graphic corpses of Ebola victims. "He cried, but no child will control me. It will be better for him to live and attend many more vacation schools than get sick from Ebola," she said.</p><p>Spread by contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, bush meat or surfaces, this Ebola outbreak has killed 729 people since it originated in Guinea, where health officials took several weeks to pinpoint the source to a remote village in the country's forest hinterlands. By then, it had spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p><p>Nigerian authorities have mobilised unusually swiftly, underlying concern about an outbreak in the continent's most populous nation and major commerce hub. Officials began printing information leaflets, including in widely-spoken pidgin English.</p><p>Akintayo Ugwani, a businessman, said: "It's terrifying. I have to get on a flight every couple of days and each time now I'm just wondering, am I entering a flying coffin?"</p><p>The country's main airline, Arik Air, has suspended flights between Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone, while international airports and seaports have been placed on red alert, with passengers being monitored. Ghana also began screening passengers.</p><p>Philip Hammond, the British foreign secretary, chaired an emergency Cobra meeting amid warnings that the virus could be a threat to Britain, although health experts said the country was well prepared to deal with any potential cases.</p><p>Hammond said no British national had been affected by the outbreak and there had been no cases in the UK.</p><p>The UK announced a £2m package of assistance to the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) and Médecins sans Frontières, which are tackling Ebola in Sierra Leone and Liberia. The European commission said it would allocate an additional €2m (£1.6m) – on top of €1.9m  – to help contain the spread of the epidemic.</p><p>"The level of contamination on the ground is extremely worrying and we need to scale up our action before many more lives are lost," said Kristalina Georgieva, EU commissioner for humanitarian aid.</p><p><em>Wade Williams in Monrovia contributed to this report</em></p>

We are dismayed by some of the sensational and misleading headlines to date."</p><p>A spokeswoman for Health Protection Scotland (HPS) said that no one has tested positive for Ebola in Scotland.</p><p>Spread by contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, surfaces or food, the  Ebola outbreak has killed 729 people since it originated in Guinea. By the time health officials pinpointed the source to a remote village it had spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p><p>Dr Colin Ramsay of HPS said medical staff at the Games and more widely had been briefed to look out for Ebola. "Steps have been taken to remind healthcare practitioners across the whole of the UK about being aware of Ebola infection, particularly in people coming from these affected countries," he told BBC Radio Scotland.</p><p>Ramsay said: "There's been no programme of actively screening athletes simply because of the Commonwealth Games. The situation is that if someone presents with symptoms suggestive of the possibility of Ebola virus infection and who has come from a country affected by the current outbreak – and that's Sierra Leone and Guinea and Liberia – they would be investigated accordingly and that would involve managing them with a set of standard precautions."</p><p>He added: "People in this sort of situation would be investigated for a number of conditions, not just Ebola. Sometimes people have more common diseases such as malaria, so they are given a battery of tests to exclude all these diseases, but there are special tests that would be done for Ebola in these circumstances if someone has been in a country affected by the outbreak in the relevant period."</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/31/atlanta-emory-university-hospital-ebola-patient <p>Emory University Hospital in Atlanta is set to receive a patient infected with the deadly Ebola disease currently sweeping through swaths of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/30/ebola-in-west-africa-the-outbreak-country-by-country">west Africa</a>. </p> <p>The patient is expected to arrive “within the next several days”, the university said in a statement. The exact date of arrival is not yet known. The university did not give the patient’s name. </p> <p>“Emory University Hospital has a specially built isolation unit set up in collaboration with the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] to treat patients who are exposed to certain serious infectious diseases. It is physically separate from other patient areas and has unique equipment and infrastructure that provide an extraordinarily high level of clinical isolation,” the university said.</p> <p>Reuters is reporting that the patient is one of the two American humanitarian aid workers infected with Ebola while responding to the outbreak in Liberia. Dr Kent Brantly of Texas and Nancy Writebol, a missionary from North Carolina, have both showed signs of improvement, but remain in serious condition.</p> <p>The disease, which has no known cure, has reportedly killed at least 700 people during the current outbreak, in which there have been more than 1,000 confirmed, probable or suspected infections.<br /></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/31/ebola-africa-west-ethics-vaccine-drug-testing <p>In 2002, scientists writing in a leading American medical journal discussed the possibility that the Ebola virus could be used in a biochemical weapon. It would be technically difficult and unlikely to cause mass destruction because those infected quickly die and the virus is not as transmissible as many assume. But, the scientists warned, if it could be done, there would be no protection. No vaccine or drug treatment exists.</p><p>They were writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association in the wake of 9/11 and the subsequent anthrax attacks in New York. Since then, fear of viruses raining out of US skies has diminished – and so has any sense of urgency over the development of vaccines or treatment for a disease that manifests itself in unpredictable outbreaks and kills relatively small numbers of people in remote parts of Africa.</p><p>Neglected tropical diseases, of which Ebola is one, become visible in the west only when they appear to threaten it. Ebola has had more attention than many, probably because of the dramatic nature of the disease and the need for full body suits and face masks for those caring for its victims. The names of other such diseases – the parasitic leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis, for example – hardly trip off the tongue in London or San Francisco.</p><p>Yet Ebola is not a priority for the not-for-profit Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, which works with the World Health Organisation and others to incentivise and encourage pharmaceutical companies to research and develop treatments. It affects far fewer people than parasitic diseases, and the outbreaks, although appalling, are sporadic.</p><p>But in a few research institutes and biotech companies in north America, there is work going on, some of it funded by the American military. The US department of defence Joint Project Manager Medical Countermeasure Systems has put $140m (£80m) into the early development of a potential drug by the Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation, which dosed its first human subject in January this year. The phase 1 trial is designed only to ensure the drug has no ill effects in healthy people who have been nowhere near the Ebola virus, but last week, it was put on hold while the regulator, the food and drug administration, asked for more information to ensure the safety of the volunteers.</p><p>There were protests over the FDA's intervention and calls for the drug to be fast-tracked, since more than 600 people in west Africa had already died. But even if the FDA felt it was a good idea to test the drug on patients in Africa, trials in humans take so long to set up that the current outbreak will probably be over by the time anybody is ready.</p><p>There are some vaccines in development which look promising. "Many of them have just been tested in mice and guinea pigs, but a few have been tested in non-human primates and worked, protecting them from challenge with the virus," said Professor Diane Griffin from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.</p><p>But however great the need, rushing the vaccine to an outbreak of Ebola in west Africa is not on the cards. "I think people are really anxious just because the vaccines haven't been tested in humans for safety as far as I know," said Griffin, of the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at the school's centre for global health.</p><p>Running a trial in the middle of a disease outbreak is really difficult too, because of the careful explanation that must be given to all those who are vaccinated – and those who are not – who are in a distressing situation. Potential side-effects must be talked through and informed consent given.</p><p>Pfizer's attempt to trial an oral antibiotic during a meningitis B outbreak in Kano, Nigeria, in 1996 ended in disaster for the company, which was sued by families who blamed the drug for deaths. It paid millions in compensation.</p><p>But if there are to be vaccines and drugs against Ebola, trials in outbreaks will have to be done. "It would be unethical not to acknowledge that potential new treatments could both save lives and reduce transmission in this and future outbreaks," says Professor Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. "Is it time to fast track those with clear safety data in humans for use in this epidemic?"</p><p>He believes it is essential for those with promising drugs or vaccines to be ready to go. They must have done all the preparatory work, the early testing and safety checks, have got the approval of ethical and regulatory bodies and have local and national governments as well as NGOs in the field such as Medecines Sans Frontieres on board.</p><p>"It is a complex situation, requiring very careful consideration," Farrar says. But ultimately, the only way to find out if drugs and vaccines against Ebola work is to try them out in an epidemic.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/31/us-peace-corps-evacuation-ebola-west-africa <p>The largest recorded Ebola outbreak in history has led the US Peace Corps to evacuate hundreds of volunteers from three affected west African countries, and a State Department official says two volunteers are under isolation after having contact with a person who later died of the virus.</p> <p>The Peace Corps said on Wednesday it was evacuating 340 volunteers from Liberia as well as neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone.<br /></p> <p>The State Department official said the two volunteers were not symptomatic and were under observation. The official was not authorized to discuss the cases for attribution, and declined to say where the volunteers were serving or when they were exposed.</p> <p>Ebola has no vaccine and no specific treatment, with a fatality rate of at least 60%. Two other Americans, a doctor and a missionary, are fighting the virus while in isolation in Liberia. </p> <p>President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who is skipping a summit of African leaders in Washington this week amid the crisis, also called for the closure of markets in an area near the borders with infected countries Guinea and Sierra Leone.<br /></p> <p>“My fellow Liberians, Ebola is real, Ebola is contagious and Ebola kills,” she warned. “Denying that the disease exists is not doing your part, so keep yourselves and your loved ones safe.”</p> <p>Fear and panic over the mounting death toll has prompted some rural communities to accuse foreign aid workers of bringing the deadly virus. Others have kept people with Ebola symptoms at home instead of bringing them to quarantine centers. In anger, one man recently set fire to part of the health ministry building in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, after his teenage brother reportedly died of Ebola.</p> <p>Experts say the risk of travelers contracting Ebola is considered low because it requires direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions such as urine, blood, sweat or saliva. The virus can’t be spread like flu through casual contact or breathing in the same air.<br /></p> <p>Patients are contagious only once the disease has progressed to the point they show symptoms, according to the World Health Organization. The most vulnerable are health care workers and relatives who come in much closer contact with the sick.</p> <p>Two US-based missionary groups have ordered the evacuation of their non-essential personnel from Liberia after a doctor and a missionary both contracted Ebola.<br /></p> <p>SIM USA President Bruce Johnson announced Tuesday that his group and Samaritan’s Purse decided on the evacuation following an upsurge in the number of Ebola cases in Liberia. </p> <p>A Texas-trained doctor and a missionary from North Carolina have contracted the disease and are in isolation in Liberia.</p> <p>The doctor, Kent Brantly, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/29/us-doctor-ebola-liberia-kent-brantly">says he is “terrified” of the disease</a> progressing further, according to Dr David Mcray, the director of maternal-child health at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, where Brantly completed a four-year residency.</p> <p>“I’m praying fervently that God will help me survive this disease,” Brantly said in an email Monday to Mcray. He also asked that prayers be extended for Nancy Writebol, an American co-worker and missionary who also has fallen ill with Ebola.</p> <p>Jeremy Writebol told NBC’s Today show Wednesday that he’s been able to talk with his mother, Nancy, as she fights the illness.</p> <p>He says his mother is able to move around the home where she’s in isolation and has been able to get plenty of fluids.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/30/ebola-what-is-the-real-risk <p>Ebola is one of the scariest diseases on the planet, with its sudden onset, horrific symptoms and the need for doctors and nurses to wear protective clothing. But in spite of the climbing numbers of cases in west Africa and the apparent alarming pronouncements of prominent individuals in the UK, the threat to this country is considered very low.</p><p>The comments to the Daily Telegraph of Sir Mark Walport, the government's chief scientific officer, under a front page headline warning that an "outbreak of deadly Ebola virus could reach UK" came from an interview he gave the paper several weeks ago about the global spread of all sorts of infectious diseases. The urgent letters sent to GPs which excited the Daily Mail in fact went out on 2 July and were routine.</p><p>The seriousness of Ebola in west Africa, where infection control and health systems are far from adequate, should not be downplayed. But, as our experience with Mers (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome) showed, the UK has highly responsive systems that swing into place if there is an threat of a new infection arriving here.</p><p>Flu is a massive danger to every country because it is spread through water droplets in the air, so coughs and sneezes spread the disease. But Ebola is transmitted via physical contact with the bodily fluids of somebody who has fallen sick. It appears that they are not infectious until they have symptoms – and then the danger is from blood (and they haemorrhage so there is a lot of it), saliva, urine and diarrhoea. Their clothes, their bedding, needles and any other surfaces in contact with bodily fluids will also carry the virus, hence the need for full body suits and face masks for nursing staff.</p><p>In a village in Sierra Leone or Guinea, the dangers are clear. The family, nursing somebody who is sick or burying their body, is at extreme risk. So are all health workers – hospitals are the major incubation points for this disease. Teams of doctors and experts from the World Health Organisation and Médecins Sans Frontières have rushed to try to contain the outbreaks and educate the population, urging them to notify health workers if somebody becomes ill. Reports that 90% of people die have not helped and are not accurate – with intravenous fluids, patients with strong immune systems can fight off the virus, and the death rate has been closer to 50% in some places.</p><p>People do not show symptoms for two to 21 days after they become infected, so clearly there is the possibility that someone with Ebola could get on a plane and land in London. It is unlikely other people would be infected on the plane – one man flew from Liberia to Lagos in Nigeria, where he became ill, but no other passenger appears to have contracted the disease. But airlines flying out of west Africa are likely now to be warning their staff of the symptoms, just in case.</p><p>If somebody with the virus in their body but not yet ill arrived at a UK airport, they would not be detected – who would know? But border control staff have been warned of the symptoms expected of those who fall ill. Those are rapid and serious, which means that doctors would be called in immediately. If the patient had recently been in west Africa, Ebola would have to be considered as a possibility and every precaution taken.</p><p>In Europe and north America, infection control measures are stringent and would rapidly be put in place. The sick person would be isolated in hospital and every contact would be traced. Those people in turn would be quarantined in case they developed symptoms. It happened with Mers, where a man from Qatar died in a London hospital. Experts from the Health Protection Agency, now part of Public Health England, followed up over 60 people who had come into contact with him and traced more than 100 others who had had contact with his family. None had picked up the virus – but the reassuring part is the efficiency of the tracing process in the UK. Sadly, in west Africa, that sort of effort is presently nearly impossible.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/30/ebola-liberia-outbreak-contain <p>Liberia plans to shut down schools and many markets, place all non-essential public servants on leave and quarantine several communities in the most stringent bid yet to curb an Ebola epidemic that has raged for seven months across three west African nations. A Liberian civil servant who last week died after flying to Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation, brought the total number of countries hit by the deadly and contagious pathogen to four.</p><p>The latest efforts come as senior western officials, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/28/us-health-ebola-whitehouse-idUSKBN0FX1U020140728" title="">including from the US</a> and UK, held meetings to assess the risk of Ebola reaching their shores, although experts say any outbreak there is likely to be far easier to contain. Sawyer, who carried dual American and Liberian nationality, had been due to travel to the US for his daughters' birthday next month, his wife told CNN.</p><p>Several rural communities – where many view Ebola with much the same terror and misunderstanding as westerners did when the Aids epidemic began – may be quarantined, with food supplies and medical support ferried in by only approved persons, authorities said. All public facilities could be chlorinated and disinfected on Friday, and public gatherings have already been banned. The strict measures echo those that allowed Uganda to rapidly shut down an outbreak in 1997.</p><p>"It's a dire situation. The spread is overwhelming health workers and facilities. We need all the help and support we can get from the international community," Lewis Brown, Liberia's information minister, told the Guardian. He said communities most hard hit by the virus would be quarantined for as long as necessary, with security forces enforcing the plan. "It's an emergency, so we hope people will understand."</p><p>Doctors today began seeing patients at one of Liberia's main Ebola isolation wards, with up to 20 patients awaiting treatment at home. Some residents in Monrovia initially protested against a new ward being set up, fearing it would endanger them.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-443396362'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/30/1406712842104/EbolaoutbreakmapWEB.png' alt='Ebola outbreak map WEB' width='460' height='400' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Ebola outbreak in west Africa.</figcaption></figure><p>Spread by contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, bush meat or surfaces, Ebola has killed 672 people since it originated in Guinea, the impoverished west African nation. Health officials took several weeks to pinpoint the origin of the disease to a remote village in the country's forest hinterlands, by which time it had spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Authorities in all three nations have since faced a battle to win over terrified residents, as well as curb traditions that involve contact with victims' contagious corpses.</p><p>Some campaigns have shown signs of working. Sylvia Johnson, a resident in the capital Monrovia, pulled her grandson out of summer school at the beginning of the week after seeing a government-printed poster of graphic corpses of Ebola victims, who frequently die from both internal and external haemorrhaging. "He cried, but no child will control me. It will be better for him to live and attend many more vacation schools than get sick from Ebola," she said.</p><p>Nigerian authorities also mobilised <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/28/west-africa-measures-stop-ebola-spread" title="">unusually swiftly</a>, underlying their concern about an outbreak in the continent's most populous nation and major commerce hub. Police and health workers began printing information leaflets, including in widely-spoken pidgin English. The country's main carrier, Arik Air, has suspended flights between Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone, while international airports and seaports have been placed on red alert, and passengers are being monitored.</p><p>Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, has chaired an emergency Cobra meeting amid warnings that the deadly Ebola virus could be a threat to Britain, although health experts said the country was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/30/ebola-outbreak-uk-ministers-emergecny-cobra-meeting" title="">well prepared</a> to deal with any potential cases.</p><p>Hammond said no British national so far had been affected by the outbreak and there had been no cases in the UK but he chaired the meeting to assess the situation.</p><p>The UK announced a new £2m package of assistance will be made available immediately to partners including the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) and Médecins sans Frontières that are operating in Sierra Leone and Liberia to tackle the outbreak. The European commission said it would allocate an additional €2m (£1.6m) – on top of €1.9m (£1.5m) – to help contain the spread of the epidemic.</p><p>"The level of contamination on the ground is extremely worrying and we need to scale up our action before many more lives are lost," said Kristalina Georgieva, EU commissioner for humanitarian aid.</p><p><em>Wade Williams in Monrovia contributed to this story</em></p>

"The level of contamination on the ground is extremely worrying and we need to scale up our action before many more lives are lost," said Kristalina Georgieva, EU commissioner for humanitarian aid.</p><p>The money will be channelled through the World Health Organisation (WHO), MSF and the IFRC</p><p>Sir Mark Walport, the government's chief scientific adviser, said it was important to be prepared. "The government is keeping a close eye on the outbreak and we are well prepared," he said.</p><p>"No cases of imported Ebola have ever been reported in the UK. The risk to a traveller going to west Africa of contracting Ebola is very low but the chief medical officer has alerted medical practitioners about the situation in west Africa and requested they remain vigilant for unexplained illness in those who have visited the affected area."</p><p>In an interview published in Tuesday's <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/10998514/Ebola-outbreak-deadly-foreign-diseases-are-potential-major-threat-says-Chief-Scientist.html" title="">Daily Telegraph</a>, he said the disease was "potentially a major threat" to the UK because of the increasingly "interconnected" nature of the world.</p><p>He told the paper: "The most dangerous infections of humans have always been those which have emerged from other species. They are a potential major threat to us. Emerging infectious disease is a global grand challenge.</p><p>"We were lucky with Sars. But we have to do the best horizon scanning. We have to think about risk and managing risk appropriately."</p><p>A man was tested for Ebola in Britain this week but the result was negative. The Department of Health said he was checked in Birmingham after he reportedly travelled from Benin to Nigeria via Paris to the Midlands.</p><p>Another man contacted Charing Cross hospital in London over fears he had the virus, but doctors ruled it out.</p><p>Health professionals have been warned to be vigilant for signs of the virus and Public Health England has briefed border officials and airport staff on the symptoms. It has issued an urgent warning to doctors after an infected man was able to make several flights from Liberia to Nigeria, where he died.</p><p>Health workers tackling the outbreak in west Africa have been especially vulnerable to contracting the disease. Dr Sheik Humarr Khan, who was treating patients in Sierra Leone, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/29/sierra-leone-ebola-doctor-dies" title="">died on Tuesday</a> after being quarantined in hospital in the country. Two American health workers – a doctor and a missionary – are also in hospital in neighbouring Liberia after contracting the disease, prompting two US missionary groups to evacuate non-essential personnel from the country.</p><p>The pan-African airline Asky suspended all flights to and from the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone, and the Liberian Football Association said it halted all activities in the country.</p><p>Ebola is believed to have killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since the outbreak began in February, according to the WHO. The disease has no known cure.</p><p>The virus is transmitted through contact with fluids of infected people or animals, like urine, sweat, blood and saliva, even after death. Confirmed cases are first quarantined before undergoing intensive rehydration therapy. It can take up to 21 days for symptoms to show. They include vomiting, diarrhoea, internal and external bleeding.</p><p>PHE said: "Increasing case numbers and extended geographical spread may increase the risk for UK citizens engaged in humanitarian aid and healthcare delivery."</p><p>"This is because most human infections result from direct contact with the bodily fluids or secretions of infected patients, particularly in hospitals (nosocomial transmission) and as a result of unsafe procedures, use of contaminated medical devices (including needles and syringes) and unprotected exposure to contaminated bodily fluids.</p><p>"However, the risk for tourists, visitors or expatriate residents in affected areas, is still considered very low if elementary precautions are followed."A DH official added: "Protecting the public from infectious diseases is a priority and we lead the world in this field. We are well prepared to identify and deal with any potential cases of Ebola, though there has never been a case in this country. Any patients with suspected symptoms can be diagnosed within 24 hours and they would also be isolated at a dedicated unit to keep the public safe. Our specialist staff are also working with the World Health Organisation to help tackle the outbreak in Africa."</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/30/ebola-outbreak-uk-no-treatment-hard-to-catch <p>The current Ebola virus outbreak is by far the largest so far. The first recorded cases were in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in southern Sudan. In the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/30/ebola-in-west-africa-the-outbreak-country-by-country" title="">current west African outbreak</a> in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia (with one case imported into Nigeria), more than 670 people have died and there have been more than 1,200 cases. Only three previous outbreaks had more than 200 deaths; in the DRC in 1976 there were 280, with another 250 lives lost there in 1995, while 224 people died of Ebola in Uganda in 2000-1.</p> <p>The virus takes its name from the Ebola river at Yambuku, in the DRC, where the 1976 outbreak occurred. This was particularly deadly in that the mortality rate was 88%. Most outbreaks have not been quite so lethal, with about 60% being the norm. But for any infection this is staggeringly high. Smallpox rightly engendered fear and panic but in its most lethal form only killed 25%.</p> <p>Ebola’s natural home is probably fruit bats. Hunting them for food has been found to be the cause of human infections, but quite often it has been impossible to find how the first case in an outbreak got infected. Contact with dead monkeys, particularly chimpanzees, has also started outbreaks, and the virus has caused <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/12/061207-ebola-gorillas.html" title="">epidemics in gorillas</a>.</p> <p>Once human infection starts Ebola grows very rapidly in cells and kills them, in particular those that are important in regulating the immune system. In consequence it runs wild. Natural antiviral defences are shut down while the inflammatory response goes into catastrophic overdrive, causing more cell damage, blood pressure collapse and eventually heart failure. Blood clotting goes wrong, the liver and adrenals fail, and blood vessels leak. The end result is shock like that caused by an overwhelming bacterial septicaemia. One big difference is that if the infection is bacterial, the patient might be brought back from the brink by antibiotics, which is not an option for an Ebola infection. There is no specific treatment. All that can be done is trying to keep the blood pressure up and restore the fluid balance.</p> <p>Diagnosis is not easy at the beginning of the illness, because its symptoms are the same as those that are seen in many other infections, including fever, headache, aching muscles, tiredness, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. So if someone is infected and then travels to the UK before the illness develops (which usually happens five to 12 days after exposure), Ebola could be mistaken for more common conditions like malaria or food poisoning. Later the patient may develop a rash, and start to bleed from the nose, ears, eyes, gums and in the stomach. Some go blind, and have uncontrollable hiccups. These symptoms point to a lethal outcome.</p> <p>The only good news is that Ebola is quite hard to catch. Close contact with the body fluids of an infected person is needed. The virus does not spread on the wind. Burial practices involving the washing of corpses has led to the spread of infection and carers of those infected in a domestic setting (without the use of isolation units and protective suits) have a 10-20% chance of catching the virus.</p> <p>Is the UK <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/30/ebola-outbreak-uk-ministers-emergecny-cobra-meeting" title="">at risk</a>? The likelihood of an infected person travelling to the UK is very low and we have good diagnostic and isolation facilities, if needed. The most important control measure is for healthcare workers, who are the first port of call for someone who might have the disease, to ask possible cases where they have been in the last three weeks.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/28/ebola-outbreak-africa-key-questions <h2>What is Ebola?<br /></h2><p>Ebola virus disease, which used to be called Ebola haemorrhagic  fever, was named after the river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where one of the first two villages to report cases in 1976 was located. The other was in Sudan. Ebola is a severe viral illness with a sudden onset that comes from direct contact with infected living or dead rainforest animals, including chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, fruit bats, forest antelope and porcupines. It kills up to 90% of those who are infected.</p><h2>How is it transmitted?<br /></h2><p>The virus is passed from one human to another, carried in blood and bodily fluids and secretions, but also beds, sheets, clothes or other surfaces that a sick person has touched. Burial ceremonies that involve touching the body are also a risk. The virus enters the body through broken skin or mucous membrane.</p><p>The group at highest risk are health workers, caring for those with Ebola. They have to wear full protective clothing, including facemasks and goggles, and should change their gloves between one patient and the next.</p><h2>What are the symptoms?<br /></h2><p>The early signs are sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and a sore throat. Vomiting and diarrhoea follow, raising the chances that the sick man or woman will infect somebody else. The kidney and liver are affected and there can be both internal and external bleeding, which is why it was originally called Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Patients are infectious once the symptoms show, which is two to 21 days after they have contracted the virus.</p><h2>What is the treatment?<br /></h2><p>There is very little treatment. Patients will need intensive supportive care, with intravenous fluids or oral rehydration salts. They must be kept in isolation and their nurses and visitors must wear full protective suits. If people are to be nursed at home, their carers need instructions and equipment to safeguard themselves. There are no drugs to treat the disease or vaccine to prevent it, although research on a vaccine is under way.</p><h2>Why is there no cure?<br /></h2><p>It has proved very hard to find drugs to treat viral diseases from animals, from influenza to HIV. Although the death rate is high, outbreaks of ebola are infrequent and have so far been contained each time. As with many of the so-called neglected tropical diseases, there is not a potentially lucrative market for drug companies, so they will be reluctant to invest in research and development.</p><h2>If outbreaks can be contained and brought to a halt with good infection control, why do they return?<br /></h2><p>They can be contained in human populations but the viral reservoir still exists in animals. There will always be a risk that hunters will kill infected animals or that people will pick up those that have died of the infection in the forest and the virus will be reintroduced to the human population.</p><h2>Will closing borders help?<br /></h2><p>Containment is key to the strategy against ebola. Quarantine has been used in some outbreaks for the relatives of people who become sick. Because people are not infectious until they become obviously ill, it should in theory be possible to focus efforts on the community where the outbreak began. In the past, that has usually been villages in close proximity to rainforests.</p><p>Confirmation of a case in a city such as Lagos is a real concern, but transmission must involve direct contact with a sick individual, so is more likely in a family setting or a hospital. The biggest worry is probably that somebody showing symptoms will be taken to hospital where nursing staff are unprotected, because the disease is not recognised, sparking an outbreak that spreads to their families in turn.</p><p>Closing borders may not help keep the disease out because borders are permeable in much of Africa. The World Health Organisation says closures may hinder travel and trade without detecting cases.</p><h2>Is the rest of the world threatened by ebola?<br /></h2><p>Clearly somebody infected with the virus could theoretically get on a plane and spark an outbreak – probably in a hospital – anywhere in the world. However, as with the Mers virus, which arrived in London via a patient who was taken to St Thomas' hospital, infection control measures are so stringent in more affluent countries that it is probable the virus would be very rapidly contained.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/28/west-africa-measures-stop-ebola-spread <p>Authorities across west Africa have announced a series of measures aimed at stopping the spread of the Ebola virus, which reached a fourth country last week with a death in Lagos, Africa's most populous city.</p><p>Nigeria closed and quarantined the hospital where a man died on Friday in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/25/first-case-ebola-lagos-nigeria" title="">the country's first recorded case of the deadly and highly contagious pathogen</a>.</p><p>The closure of the clinic in one of the city's most densely populated districts came as police were called in to guard Sierra Leone's main Ebola treatment centre, while Liberia shut almost all its borders and banned public gatherings. Attempts to halt the seven month-crisis, which has spiralled into the world's biggest and most widespread outbreak of Ebola, have been hampered by a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/-sp-ebola-out-of-control-west-africa" title="">lack of resources and poor understanding</a> in a region which has never experienced an epidemic.</p><p>Ebola has killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since it was first diagnosed in February. The pathogen is passed through contact with bodily fluids of infected patients or eating infected meat, and has no known cure, although chances of survival improve dramatically with early detection and treatment.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-443276639'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/28/1406573308932/Medical-staff-put-on-thei-011.jpg' alt='Medical staff put on their protective gear in Sierra Leone' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Medical staff put on their protective gear in Sierra Leone.

His condition rapidly deteriorated before he died, said Abdulsalami Nasidi, project director at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, who attributed his death to ebola.</p><p>Officials at the World Health Organisation confirmed a sample from Nigeria was being tested for ebola, but did not confirm the results.</p><p>The death marks a new and alarming cross-border development in a disease that has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/-sp-ebola-out-of-control-west-africa" title="">spiralled into the world's biggest epidemic, spread across three west African countries</a>. At least 660 people have died in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since ebola was first diagnosed in February.</p><p>The pathogen is passed through contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, and has no known cure, although chances of survival improve dramatically with early detection and treatment.</p><p>But weak health systems and frequent cross-border travel have hampered efforts to contain the virus in a region which has never before experienced an outbreak.</p><p>Lagos state authorities said they had requested the flight's manifest to contact the other passengers, and began distributing protective clothing to health workers, state health advisor Yewande Adeshina said. Sawyer flew from Liberia's capital of Monrovia, with a brief flight stopover in nearby Togo. His sister is believed to have died of ebola in the last month, a Liberian official told the Guardian.</p><p>Rumours about the virus – which causes a painful fever that degenerates into internal and external bleeding – were met with scepticism from residents in the crowded business district where Sawyer was treated. "I cannot believe it is true," said trader Segun Kosoko, who said he had seen two traders donning face masks.</p><p>Experts have also been alarmed by the disease's wide geographical spread, from Guinea's remote interior forest region, where it originated, to densely populated coastal regions.</p><p>Ghana has had several unconfirmed scares, while Sierra Leone's capital Freetown recorded its first confirmed case this week. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/25/sierra-leone-hunts-victim-deadly-virus-ebola-snatched-hospital-family" title="">Authorities there were forced to launch a public appeal</a> after the victim slipped out of hospital. Her family forcibly removed her – as many have done, either fearing they would catch the disease while in quarantine, or doubting its existence.</p><p>Radio stations in Freetown, a city of about 1 million people, broadcast the appeal to locate the woman, named as   Saudatu Koroma. "She is a positive case and her being out there is a risk to all. We need the public to help us locate her," the appeal stated.</p><p>Koroma, 32, had been admitted to an isolation ward while blood samples were tested for the virus, said Sidi Yahya Tunis, a health ministry spokesman.</p><p>Meanwhile in Liberia this week, a man burned down a room in the ministry of health after his 14-year-old relative died of ebola. He said a lack of doctors and nurses – many of whom have been ostracised from their communities – had led to the boy's death.</p><p>Nigeria's ministry of health urged residents to follow guidelines to prevent the virus' spread, and launched a hotline number.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/jul/17/ebola-sierra-leone-epidemic <p><em>Ane Bjøru Fjeldsæter is a 31-year-old psychologist from Trondheim, Norway. For the past month, she has been working for </em><a href="http://www.msf.org/" title=""><em>Médecins sans Frontières</em></a><em> (MSF) in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, helping to fight </em><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/14/ebola-epidemic-guinea-sierra-leone-liberia-msf-world-health-organisation" title=""><em>the largest ever outbreak of Ebola</em></a><em>, which has killed more than 600 people in three countries. She provides support and counselling to patients and their families, as well as to the staff whose job it is to deal with the dead bodies.  </em></p><p>I was expecting the Ebola epidemic to be quite gruesome and unlike anything I had seen before. But I really didn't expect its magnitude – this outbreak is enormous. In Sierra Leone, it killed off a lot of health workers before MSF even arrived. Not surprisingly, medical staff were reluctant to work with us at first. They'd never come across Ebola before – but at least they had previous experience of people suffering and people dying. But for the non-medical staff, like the hygienists – our hospital cleaners – it's been a new and disturbing experience, and a large part of my work involves helping them with counselling and support.</p><p>The hygienists have the hardest job of all because they are the ones dealing with the dead bodies. Since our Ebola centre opened two weeks ago, we've had 37 deaths: an average of two or three a day. A lot of the cleaners are young, unskilled workers. In an area with an unemployment rate of 95%, they jumped at this opportunity to get a job.</p><p>They are the ones who mop up the vomit, the stools and the blood. And when there's a death, they are the ones who retrieve the body from the isolation ward, put it in the morgue and disinfect it. In the final stages of the disease, the viral load increases massively, which means the dead bodies are extremely contagious and very dangerous to deal with.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-449195803'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2014/7/16/1405525975590/MDG--MSF-Ebola-Treatment--007.jpg' alt='MDG : MSF Ebola Treatment Centre in Kailahun, Sierra Leone' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Doctors try to feed a girl in the centre's high-contamination-risk zone. Photograph: Sylvain Cherkaoui/Cosmos for MSF </figcaption></figure><p>Dealing with the dead bodies is disturbing: the hygienists experience feelings of sadness and fear, but also disgust. When Ebola patients die, there's bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea. The cleaners tell me they have flashbacks of the things they have seen and of things they have smelled. Even wearing a mask, you can't shut out all the smells.</p><p>Traditionally, in Sierra Leone, dead bodies are taken care of by the tribal elders. A lot of the hygienists feel they are too young to be dealing with the dead, so worry they're being disrespectful of their culture's traditions. We make sure that on each shift there is always one man and one woman, so that when someone dies, there will always be someone of the same sex to tend to them.</p><p>The local staff experience huge stigma from the community. The son of one of our workers recently died from malaria. People in his village immediately said he had caused his son's death because he was working with Ebola. It was very distressing for him.</p><p>The stigma makes it hard for the hygienists. We tell them: "You are heroes, you're doing a very important service for your community – it's absolutely vital that someone is doing this job." But although we see them as heroes, that isn't always how they are perceived by their families, their friends or their villages.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-449195804'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2014/7/16/1405525722967/MDG--MSF-Ebola-Treatment--009.jpg' alt='MDG : MSF Ebola Treatment Centre in Kailahun. Sierra Leone' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A patient attempts to rehydrate himself under the watchful eye of a nurse. Photograph: Sylvain Cherkaoui/Cosmos for MSF </figcaption></figure><p>When we discharge a patient who has survived Ebola, it makes an enormous difference to them. On Tuesday, three people who had been cured were discharged from the isolation ward, and all the cleaners were dancing, deliriously happy and taking photographs. They find ways to manage the stress: they take good care of each other; when someone is upset, they talk about it, and they are very open about voicing their concerns and difficulties.</p><p>Still, the local staff have had their lives turned upside down. But then throughout the entire district everything is upside down. Here in Kailahun, the banks are shut, the schools have been closed for more than a month, and the students are very upset that they are missing their exams. A lot of people are isolated by the fear that if they go near other people, they will get the disease. People are at a loss to understand what is happening to them.</p><p>Last week, a girl came out of the isolation ward. Her name was Bintu and she was almost two. Both her parents had tested positive for Ebola, but she tested negative, so we had to take her out of the ward because the risk of contamination was too high. That was a horrible day.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-449195805'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2014/7/16/1405524312844/MDG--MSF-psychologist-Ane-009.jpg' alt='MDG : MSF psychologist Ane Bjøru Fjeldsæter at Ebola Treatment Centre in Kailahun, Sierra Leone ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Psychologist Ane Bjøru Fjeldsæter welcomes Tamba James, who has been tested negative for Ebola. Photograph: Sylvain Cherkaoui/Cosmos for MSF </figcaption></figure><p>The nurses told me she didn't know how to speak. For the two days she'd been in the ward, she'd been so shocked that she hadn't uttered a word. This can happen to children – it's called elective mutism. When she came out, she was in shock: she didn't make eye contact; she didn't speak to anyone. We put her in a chair and she turned around, with her back to the world.</p><p>It must have been a terribly disturbing experience for a child: to see someone come into the ward in a spacesuit; to hear them speaking to her mother in words she didn't understand; to see her mother start crying; and then to be handed over to the stranger in the spacesuit and carried off.</p><p>I sat with her for four hours, trying to talk to her in a calm and normal voice and singing her songs, to see if the shock would pass. By the end of the four hours she had turned around and was facing me. She made eye contact, she put her hand out for me to touch her, she tried to start a conversation with me. You could see that she was starting to warm up to me, and that she wasn't in the same condition.</p><p>Bintu became an orphan that day. She is in the care of our child protection partner and they will locate other family members who can take care of her. She will need to be monitored for 21 days to see that she does not develop the disease herself.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/14/ebola-epidemic-guinea-sierra-leone-liberia-msf-world-health-organisation <p>The outbreak of Ebola in West Africa is unrelenting: according to the World Health Organisation there have now been <a href="http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4220-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-10-july-2014.html">888 cases and 539 deaths</a> across Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since <a href="http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4165-dashboard-ebola-virus-disease-evd-in-west-africa-16-june-2014.html">the virus</a> was first reported in March this year. The epidemic is unprecedented and the global health community has been left scrambling to contain the disease, for which there is no vaccine or cure. </p> <p>In a bid to boost the response to the disease, the World Health Organisation (WHO) convened a <a href="http://www.afro.who.int/en/media-centre/events/details/317-special-ministerial-meeting-on-ebola-accra.html">special meeting on 2-3 July</a> in Accra, Ghana, with health ministers from 11 West African countries and partners involved in tackling the disease.</p> <p>Here, professionals involved in fighting the deadly virus share their experiences of what it’s like to be at the epicentre of the epidemic.</p> <h2><b>Dr Ibrahim Bah, medical supervisor at the isolation centre of Hôpital National de Donka, Conakry, Guinea</b></h2> <p>I work in the department for infectious and tropical diseases so I am used to working on epidemics but this is the first time I have dealt with Ebola. It is a new disease in Guinea. Before Médecins Sans Frontières arrived, we had no specific training on dealing with the virus. At the beginning, I was scared: I saw people haemorrhaging to death. The experience is traumatising for patients too: they know we don’t have a vaccine or a cure, and they think: “I have Ebola, my life is over.”</p> <p>The earlier patients seek treatment however, the higher their chances of survival. We have had more recoveries than deaths on the ward. The first recovery was a real celebration – it gave us strength to continue working.</p> <p> Safety is paramount but working with the protective clothing is exhausting in the heat. On very hot days, you sweat so much that you can’t keep the equipment on in the ward for more than 30 to 45 minutes. </p> <p>It has been very hard for us: there is a lot of stigma attached to working with the virus and some people have been rejected by their families. But as people become more aware and realise Ebola need not be fatal, things will change.</p> <h2><b>Dr Jacob Mufunda, World Health Organisation representative, Freetown, Sierra Leone</b></h2> <p>One of the positive outcomes of the emergency ministerial meeting is that it aligned our actions. Until then, each country had been dealing with the disease individually. Yet the epicentre of the disease is the border area triangle between Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The people living in this region are the Kissi. They speak the same language in each country and they move across borders along traditional routes.</p> <p>So WHO is very clear on this issue: closing borders would make no difference. What is crucial is that we keep focusing on surveillance and that we harmonise our approach across countries because if you use different languages and different practices to tackle the disease and approach these people, who should they believe?</p> <p>We want to encourage countries in West Africa to send their medical staff to affected countries so that they get hands-on experience. That way, if the virus spreads, they’ll be better equipped to tackle the epidemic.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Map">  <iframe width='100%' height='520' frameborder='0' src='//rachelbanninglover.cartodb.com/viz/defafe84-0b3e-11e4-bac0-0e73339ffa50/embed_map?title=true&description=true&search=false&shareable=true&cartodb_logo=true&layer_selector=false&legends=true&scrollwheel=true&fullscreen=true&sublayer_options=1%7C1%7C1&sql=&sw_lat=1.7136116598836222&sw_lon=-21.741943359375&ne_lat=19.041348796589013&ne_lon=13.128662109375' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption> Credit: Rachel Banning-Lover</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><b>Mohamed Fofana, training manager with ActionAid, Kono District, Sierra Leone</b></h2> <p>We have just finished training 24 community outreach workers to raise awareness about Ebola. A key consideration in recruiting participants was that they are influential in their community so that when they go back, people listen to them.</p> <p>The training focused on the origins of the disease, its transmission, the signs and symptoms and what to do if you suspect a case of Ebola. We heavily emphasised the fact that transmission can happen through a dead body because in Sierra Leone, it is customary to pay your respect to the dead, to wash the body, touch it or keep clothes or sheets of the deceased, but these practices do not conform with Ebola prevention.</p> <p>If they suspect that someone is infected or has died from Ebola, outreach workers know that they should immediately notify the authorities. They must also refer the patient to the nearest health facility or make sure that no one comes into contact with the corpse if the person is dead. A specially-trained burial team will intervene instead.</p> <h2><b>Dr Bernice Dahn, deputy minister for health services, </b><b>Monrovia, </b><b>Liberia </b></h2> <p>Our biggest challenge is denial. People do not believe that Ebola is happening. There is a lot of fear and panic too and we’re struggling to get people to come into hospital when we suspect they are infected. The key for us is to align our traditional leaders with medical and health ministry officials: our society holds them in high esteem so if they are on board, they can educate their communities.</p> <p>Dealing with Ebola is labour intensive. Case detection is a door-to-door process; once identified, patients have to be taken to isolation wards; and then we need to trace all the people they have been in contact with. We also need special burial teams to handle dead bodies. Sorting out the logistics for all these interventions has stretched us.</p> <p>The difficulty is that the situation keeps evolving so we’ve had to modify our response needs: our initial strategy cost was $1.2 million but as the epidemic has progressed, we estimate we’ll now need $6.5 million.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/08/doctors-technology-ebola-africa <p>A Jeopardy-winning supercomputer is among technologies that could help prevent future Ebola epidemics such as the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/-sp-ebola-out-of-control-west-africa" title="">outbreak</a> that has killed more than 460 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.</p><p>Doctors have called for greater use of emerging technologies to curb the outbreak, and said many cases were going undetected as victims opted for self-help or traditional cures.</p><p>"Emerging technologies can help early-warning systems, outbreak response and communication between healthcare providers, wildlife and veterinary professionals," four doctors at the Mercy hospital research laboratory in the Sierra Leone city of Bo <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2961119-3/fulltext" title="">wrote in the Lancet</a>.</p><p>The team, headed by a US-based specialist, Karen Jacobsen, said smartphones should play a greater role in combating the disease.</p><p>"Our laboratory and others in the region have shown that routine syndromic surveillance systems can be designed to rely on mobile phones which have become ubiquitous in west Africa," they wrote. Researchers forecast that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/internet-use-mobile-phones-africa-predicted-increase-20-fold" title="">mobile internet use in Africa will increase 20-fold in the next five years</a> – double the rate of growth in the rest of the world.</p><p>Doctors – numbering as few as one per 10,000 patients in rural Guinea – have struggled to contain the spread of Ebola, which can have a fatality rate of up to 90%. Almost four decades after its discovery, the virus has no cure or vaccine.</p><p>This year IBM <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/africa/project-lucy.shtml" title="">announced</a> a $100m (£60m) project to use its Watson supercomputer to help solve African problems. Watson has been used to help treat cancer patients in the US and understands human language well enough that it was able to beat two champions on the US TV quiz show Jeopardy in 2011. Its ability to "learn" after rapidly analysing huge amounts of data sets it apart from conventional supercomputers that focus on number crunching.</p><p>IBM's west Africa director, Taiwo Otiti, said: "The beauty about Watson is it's a community computer. You could feed it information about Ebola cases, for instance, and then you could ask it questions, and it will give you a prognosis and suggest the best treatment for a particular patient based on that data."</p><p>Access to the system could enable poorer parts of Africa to "leapfrog" stages of development in much the same way that mobile phones took off across the continent in places lacking landline infrastructure, Michel Bézy, a Rwanda-based technology professor who helped develop the Watson system, told the Guardian at the project's launch.</p><p>Other technology is being adopted to help curb diseases such as measles and malaria still epidemic in Africa. Researchers in Burkina Faso use satellite data to track Saharan dust storms and their connection with meningitis, an airborne disease transmitted more easily in dusty conditions.</p><p>And simple text messages have played a vital role in health education. Fiona Mclysaght, Sierra Leone director of NGO Concern, said: "It's  a very useful medium to dispel myths and help change attitudes, and we've been using it a lot in urban areas."</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/jul/08/ebola-virus-west-africa-cured-preventable-sierra-leone <p>The role of the international community in current crises in the Central African Republic and northern Nigeria may be mired in confusion, but it can do something about the Ebola epidemic in west Africa.</p><p>The outbreak of the virus, which started in Guinea and has spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone, is the <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/6/26/5839394/the-deadliest-ebola-outbreak-in-history-is-happening-right-now" title="">deadliest in recorded history</a>, with Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring the situation <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/-sp-ebola-out-of-control-west-africa" title="">out of control</a>.</p><p>There are more than 759 cases across 60 sites since the first ones were confirmed in March – that's almost 50 known cases per week and a 20% increase in cases since 23 June. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-28119365" title="">Almost 500 people have died</a> from the disease, which has spread across international borders.</p><p>Ebola has a <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/" title="">fatality rate of up to 90%</a> – once you have it, your chances of survival may be just one in 10. There is no vaccine and no cure; the only way to stop the virus is to prevent it or treat the symptoms if diagnosed early enough. It is primarily spread by contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person and in some cases by contact with dead animals (primarily monkeys and bats) which are infected.</p><p>But here is where the international community can help. The health systems in west African countries are weak: three <a href="https://data.undp.org/dataset/Table-1-Human-Development-Index-and-its-components/wxub-qc5k" title="">countries ranked 174 (Liberia), 177 (Sierra Leone) and 178 (Guinea) out of 186 countries for human development</a>, according to the UN development programme. So, one of the world's most deadly viruses is plaguing three of the countries least equipped to cope with it.</p><p>In Sierra Leone, I have been involved in a two-year <a href="http://www.securelivelihoods.org/content/2265/Sierra-Leone" title="">research programme</a> to prevent malnutrition. This has involved spending time at some of the government-run peripheral health units (PHUs) in northern Sierra Leone, on the border with Guinea. The PHUs are the frontline of healthcare – assuming, of course, you can reach one of the 1,228 clinics across the country (one community we visited is a 6km walk from the nearest PHU). When access to state health services is limited; locals often turn to traditional healers, who <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/-sp-ebola-out-of-control-west-africa" title="">sometimes misdiagnose Ebola and treat it as a curse</a>.</p><p>The PHUs are critical in providing immunisations, malaria treatment, delivering babies, providing free medical care to pregnant and lactating mothers and children under five – but they are not without serious problems. Staff often lack good-quality training, partly because they tend to learn through cascade models, where one person might train 10 others, who in turn train 10 more, and so on – operating like a system of Chinese whispers with all the <a href="http://www.securelivelihoods.org/publications_details.aspx?resourceid=290&amp;CategoryID=2265" title="">potential miscommunication this can involve</a>.</p><p>There is a high turnover of PHU staff owing to poor working conditions: for example, <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/report/95896/sierra-leone-drug-diversions-hamper-free-healthcare" title="">nurses earn just $55 (£32) per month</a> – roughly $1.80 per day – meaning that new, untrained staff are commonly found at the frontline of Sierra Leone's healthcare system. A lack of quality training means staff are <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/13/157" title="">not always equipped</a> to deliver appropriate healthcare messages or treatment. In fact, such professionals make up a large number of those who have died in the Ebola outbreak, having failed to take precautions in dealing with infected patients. The PHUs often face shortages of equipment and medicine.</p><p>To bring the virus under control, countries need more help from external partners. In the immediate term, emergency humanitarian support is needed to treat those infected and prevent further cases; MSF says it has <a href="http://www.msf.org/article/ebola-west-africa-epidemic-requires-massive-deployment-resources" title="">reached its limit</a> and that a <a href="http://www.msf.org/article/ebola-west-africa-epidemic-requires-massive-deployment-resources" title="">massive deployment of resources</a> is required. If donors and individuals want to support aid that shows tangible results in relatively short timeframes, supporting the response to the Ebola virus seems a good option that could save potentially thousands of lives.</p><p>In the longer term, support must focus on building the capacities of national health and sanitation systems to respond to emergencies and prevent such unnecessary loss of life. Ebola is not the first disease to wreak havoc in this region. Less than two years ago, Guinea and Sierra Leone faced a <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/report/96379/guinea-sierra-leone-cholera-outbreak-easing" title="">cholera outbreak that killed 392 people</a>.</p><p>Prevention might be better than cure, but it is also much harder to build capacity to do this. This is because preventative capacity is not only about technical knowledge, but about <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/futuredevelopment/beyond-stuff-capacity-relational-concept" title="">how well the different parts of health and sanitation systems work together</a> and interact with local dynamics, such as preference for tradition healers or stigma, for example.</p><p>Building this capacity to prevent future health emergencies is a long-term endeavour that becomes more critical with each epidemic in the region.</p><p><em>Lisa Denney is a research fellow in the politics and governance programme at the </em><a href="http://www.odi.org" title=""><em>Overseas Development Institute</em></a><em>.

An earlier version said Ebola could be spread through the water supply, ie if contaminated with infected <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/humanitarian.pdf">urine</a>. However according to the World Health Organisation, human-to-human transmission of the virus arises from direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and indirect contact with environments contaminated with such fluids.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/-sp-ebola-out-of-control-west-africa <p>When ebola first struck Pujeh, a village deep in Sierra Leone’s forested interior region, residents did what they always do when a mysterious illness brings death: they consulted the traditional healer. But the elderly herbalist soon caught one of the world’s most contagious diseases, and then became a source for spreading it as visitors streamed in.<br /></p> <p>By the time officials had pinpointed Pujeh as a hotspot for the disease months later, dozens had died. “The people living in these areas said there’s no such thing as ebola,” said a district doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity. “They have their traditional beliefs and their traditional cures and they look up to their traditional leaders. Until we can bring the traditional leaders onside, it will be very difficult to convince them that ebola even exists.”</p> <p>As the death toll from the latest outbreak of the world’s deadliest virus climbed to 467 – far exceeding the previous most lethal outbreak which killed 254 people in Congo – officials and health workers are battling a surge of infections propelled by misinformation and doubt about the disease’s existence on one side, and mistrust of scandal-hit governments on the other.</p> <p>Following a Doctors Without Borders warning that the illness is “out of control” in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, west African health ministers on Wednesday began a two-day summit in Ghana’s capital of Accra to discuss ways to strengthen regional co-operation. The World Health Organisation has also warned four other west African countries – Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau – to prepare for the possible arrival of travellers carrying the virus.</p> <p>Some government officials have disputed the WHO’s statement, saying the increasing death toll is a sign of better surveillance. “We are not saying everything is okay but there are fewer people dying in silence now, which is a good thing – the more we can identify when and where there are fatalities, the better we can prevent further cases,” health ministry official Sakouba Keita said from Guinea’s capital of Conakry.</p> <p>The country has been the hardest hit by the virus, which first appeared there in February, before spreading through the tropical forests that sprawl into Liberia and Sierra Leone. More disturbingly, it has also jumped to all three countries’ densely-populated capitals.</p> <p>“This is different from other cases just by the fact it’s a cross-border epidemic. Previous outbreaks have been very localised, which makes them easier to isolate and contain. Now for the first time, it’s also affecting urban areas,” said Dr Nestor Ndayimirije, Liberia’s WHO representative who has handled epidemics in several other countries.</p> <p>Ebola was first identified in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan in 1976, which suffered simultaneous outbreaks of different strains miles apart. </p> <p>It was named after Congo’s Ebola river, where its most lethal mutation – the Zaire strain – infected 318 people and killed 280. </p>  <figure class="element element-image element--supporting" data-media-id="gu-fc-a72943de-9e23-403c-8bfc-6121c5ac0464"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/2/1404303591744/f9124b54-6f90-42ab-9dbb-e1464404993d-280x420.jpeg" alt="A vendor holds up a fruit bat at a food market in Congo." width="280" height="420" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Ebola is believed to be hosted by the fruit bat, a delicacy in Guinea and Liberia. Photograph: JIRO OSE/Reuters/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Described by virologists as a “molecular shark”, ebola is believed to be hosted by the fruit bat, a delicacy in Guinea and Liberia. The current strain is at least the fifth mutation since its discovery in 1976. Diagnosis is often complicated by the fact symptoms mirror those of malaria, common in the region, including fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. Victims sometimes have horrific internal and external bleeding and most die of shock or multiple organ failure, although chances of survival increase dramatically if adequate treatment is received early on. No cure exists for ebola but confirmed cases are first quarantined before undergoing intensive rehydration therapy. Due to its high contagion rate, medical workers should wear head-to-toe biohazard suits even when dealing with dead patients.</p> <p>Weak public health systems have also undermined attempts to halt the disease. Sierra Leone and Liberia are both recovering from decades of back-to-back civil wars, while half a century of dictatorship in Guinea ended in 2010.</p> <p>Daily reports from Liberia’s ministry of health provide a glimpse of just how big the hurdles are. On the eve of the regional summit, two suspected cases from Voinjama had travelled to the capital Monrovia – but specimens hadn’t been collected because “the county laboratory supervisor could not be found,” internal notes said.</p> <p>The report also warned of an acute shortage of thermometers among a team dispatched to trace those who might have been in contact with suspects. Many of them feared taking temperatures in case they were exposed to the disease or attacked by locals, it added.</p> <p>But an alarmingly wide spread is partly down to geography. “The deaths have been increasing because of traditional burial rites in that region,” said Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia’s deputy chief medical officer. The Kissi ethnicity, found in all three countries, traditionally keep their dead at home for several days, and mourners touch the deceased’s head frequently before burial.</p> <p>Ebola has a fatality rate of up to 90% and is transmitted through contact with fluids of infected people or animals, like urine, sweat, blood and saliva, even after death.</p> <p>A doctor in Sierra Leone said patients’ families often attempted to break them out of treatment centres – often successfully. “Some of them are in denial and that it is something they can treat at home, and faith healers are one of the problems for us. When you have patients disappearing like that, you don’t know where the virus will appear next.”</p> <p>When trader Fiya Lasana was diagnosed with suspected ebola in a clinic in Sierra Leone’s Kailahun district, he was put under quarantine. But convinced he had only malaria, he slipped out. Days later he returned, weak and dazed, for treatment. “My family tried prayers, but that didn’t work, so I returned,” said Lasana, who was declared ebola-free after eleven days.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Map of the latest ebola outbreak in west Africa">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1404317935763/Ebola_outbreak_map_WEB.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Liberia’s president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, on Monday issued a warning on state radio that anyone suspected of holding ebola patients in homes or churches would be prosecuted.</p> <p>The disease has also revealed alarming mistrust between citizens and public office holders in a region with shocking corruption levels.</p> <p>Ebola was initially viewed as a government conspiracy to depopulate Sierra Leone’s Kailahun district, and fierce resistance to the arrival of health workers culminated in the stoning of a Doctors Without Borders vehicle. In Liberia, many remain adamant the outbreak is a hoax from government officials seeking to distract from a series of recent scandals, or for health officials to rake in public funds.</p> <p>“I will say this loud, the government of Liberia has come up with a new strategy to divert the Liberian people’s mind,” student Alfred Randall said. “We understand the issue of ebola, ebola is real, we agree the virus is a very terrible virus, but ebola is not in Liberia,” he said.</p> <p>Health workers at the frontline of the battle – often the first to die – face other challenges. Last week, riots broke out and an ambulance was attacked as family members fought to reclaim a victim’s corpse from a hospital in Kenema, Sierra Leone’s third largest city. On the same day, a three-man burial team was chased out of the Liberian town of Banjol where they went to bury a victim. “We need to find a special place to bury these corpses, if not, the bodies will keep piling up on us,” a member of the team said, adding that families often refused to come forward to identify dead relatives for fear of catching it.</p> <p>Officials and several hundred researchers who have poured into all three countries have scrambled to disseminate public information, seen as key to containment.</p> <p>But when the outbreak first began, popular text messages circulating in Guinea said an antidote could be found in a concoction of hot chocolate, coffee, milk, raw onions and sugar.</p> <p> “Ebola, ebola, ebola. I hear it everywhere,” said Adama Sherry from behind her market stall in Sierra Leone’s Tombo, a fishing village as yet unaffected by the virus. Sherry admitted she couldn’t list the symptoms, causes or precautions.</p> <p>Nearby, a local school had recently emptied out when word spread of routine blood tests being carried out – rumour had it that the needles would infect children with ebola.</p> <p>Liberia’s health ministry has begun putting images of ebola-ravaged corpses in newspapers and on television. “They are very graphic but it is working – people are starting to see that ebola is not just a spiritual thing that you can cure through going to church,” Nyenswah, the deputy chief medical officer, said.</p> <p>Ironically, survivors often face a “second disease” of stigmatisation. Aissata Bangoura’s family have refused to speak to her since her husband died in March, even though she has been declared virus-free.</p> <p>“During my husband’s wake, I was left standing by myself. People I have known my whole life didn’t want to approach me. As far as they’re concerned, I’m a widow and a leper,” she said.</p> <p>• Donal MacCrann in Tombo, Sierra Leone and Wade Williams in Monrovia, Liberia contributed to this report.<br /></p> <p>• This article was amended on 3 July 2014.

http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/23/west-africa-ebola-epidemic-out-of-control <p>The Ebola epidemic in west Africa is "out of control" and will be contained only if politicians, religious leaders and aid agencies urgently improve their response to the unprecedented outbreak, <a href="http://www.msf.org/" title="">Médecins Sans Frontières</a> (MSF) has warned.</p><p>The disease, which is continuing to spread through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, has so far claimed 350 lives, according to the World Health Organisation (<a href="http://www.who.int/en/" title="">WHO</a>). <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_06_18_ebola/en/" title="">The total number of confirmed, probable or suspected cases stands at 567,</a> with the disease identified in more than 60 locations across the three countries. The disease, which can kill up to 90% of those who become infected, was first reported in Guinea in March.</p><p>Dr Bart Janssens, MSF's director of operations, said the charity had already treated 470 patients and was struggling to cope. "The epidemic is out of control," he said. "We have reached our limits. Despite the human resources and equipment deployed by MSF in the three affected countries, we are no longer able to send teams to the new outbreak sites."</p><p>MSF said that civil society and political and religious authorities were failing to recognise the scale of the epidemic, adding that prominent figures had to do more to promote the fight against the disease. Amid the panic, it said, key messages were not getting through and people were continuing to attend funerals where there were no infection-control measures in place.</p><p>Janssens said Ebola now had to be viewed as a public health issue throughout west Africa.</p><p>"The WHO, the affected countries and their neighbouring countries must deploy the resources necessary for an epidemic of this scale," he said. "In particular, qualified medical staff need to be made available, training in how to treat Ebola needs to be organised and, contact tracing and awareness-raising activities among the population need to be stepped up."</p><p>On Saturday, the WHO said a failure to gauge the severity of the initial outbreak and a subsequent relaxation of counter-measures had helped give rise to a "second wave" of the disease.</p><p>"When the epidemic started, it was a little underestimated, so that the states took a while to really prepare themselves," said Pierre Formenty, a WHO specialist.</p><p>"At the end of April, we started to see a decrease in the number of cases and we maybe saw a relaxation by the teams in the three countries, and this relaxation allowed things to restart. In addition, there were some problems with the affected populations which were sometimes not fully listened to."</p><p>In an interview with AFP, Formenty said that the WHO, MSF and others had mobilised dozens of experts but doctors alone would not be able to contain the epidemic.</p><p>"The most important things are monitoring and communication," he said. "States are getting better but the problems of communication continue. The medical corps on their own cannot stop this epidemic. It is only with the help of the population that we can fight this epidemic and stop it."</p><p>Formenty admitted that more needed to be done to explain the dangers of infection to those attending funerals or caring for the sick.</p><p>"One case can restart an entire epidemic," he said. "In an area where the quality of health services is not optimal, the populations have struggled to understand why we were asking them to make such an effort and probably we have not been able to explain both the disease and the means of control to the populations."</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jun/19/ebola-multidisciplinary-approach-stop-epidemic <p>As the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/06/ebola-outbreak-spreads-as-toll-reaches-337-201461822534324796.html" title="">death toll from ebola</a> in west Africa continues to rise, there is a growing awareness of the threat of diseases transmitted from animals to people.</p><p>Ebola, a haemorrhagic fever that causes uncontrolled bleeding, is dramatic in its manifestation and has a <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/" title="">case fatality rate of up to 90%</a>. Its emergence can be sudden and unexplained, and, as the recent crisis shows, it can spread across communities and borders with alarming speed.</p><p>What the outbreak confirms is that if animal transmitted diseases such as Ebola – known as <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FZoonosis&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEzfcoizjxSsDJjPp39mID4Biu4Mg" title="">zoonoses</a> – are to be tackled effectively, the response must go beyond media focus and immediate medical action when an epidemic hits. There is a crucial need for multidisciplinary working over the longer term to gain a holistic understanding of the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DvqTT15Q-_Ds" title="">drivers of these diseases.</a></p><p>This so-called <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onehealthinitiative.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH0zJMcia1x0RE8kgwDZtWGapESRA" title="">one health</a> approach takes as its premise an understanding that human health, animal health and environmental health are all interlinked. It calls for collaborative efforts between natural and social scientists – including doctors, vets, environmental scientists, geographers and anthropologists – at local, national and international levels.</p><p>Such a holistic understanding of health is not new. It is however increasingly gaining <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.advanz.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFlVhqVHYKh9itFkWZY6wJcyKfq-w" title="">traction</a> among those in the field, with the veterinary sector proving to be particularly <a href="http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/174/4/85.full" title="">quick to recognise the </a>benefits of one health.  A recent joint <a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/funding/opportunities/2012/zoonoses-emerging-livestock-systems.aspx" title="">research initiative </a> from the Department for International Development (DfID) and the social science, natural environment, medical and bioscience research councils, recognises the benefits of the approach. It aims to fund multidisciplinary research that would, among other benefits, reduce the impact of zoonoses on vulnerable people and their livestock.</p><p>When natural and social scientists work together – not just alongside each other, but meaningfully integrate their findings – it can be <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.nature.com%2Fsoapboxscience%2F2013%2F04%2F10%2Fhow-multidisciplinary-work-was-made-meaningful-for-me&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3sr_CTmC561yJbJODrrwfazP8YA" title="">very productive.</a> However, breaking down the barriers between researchers is one thing. The real challenge is to persuade those with the funds and the power to make <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ids.ac.uk%2Fpublication%2Fzoonoses-from-panic-to-planning&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNElirooojywVBfkkxMxFiGQKHYwuA" title="">cross-sector action happen</a>. One of the issues that urgently needs to be tackled is a reconsideration of funding models to help facilitate cross-sector working.</p><p>Over the past 40 years more than 60% of emerging infectious diseases affecting people have had their origin in wildlife or livestock. Many of these zoonoses may cause death more slowly than Ebola, and remain unnoticed by anybody outside the immediate populations affected by them, but their effects are often devastating.</p><p>An example is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Ftrypanosomiasis_african%2Fen%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQBxXNjAEpOM6tgMXkMPwAfy2TyQ" title="">trypanosomiasis</a>, a disease caused by parasites transmitted by the tsetse fly, which affects both humans and animals and is widespread in large parts of Africa. This disease is one of four zoonoses being studied by the multidisciplinary research programme <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.driversofdisease.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRliG9z2xPJp_3VyJR_yjGqi02JA" title="">Dynamic drivers of disease in Africa</a>, which is considering the complex links between ecosystems, zoonoses, health and wellbeing. While there were <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fmediacentre%2Ffactsheets%2Ffs103%2Fen%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1E0c8e2dTP1addy1obh1Dl07o_A" title="">88 Ebola cases</a> reported in 2012, 50 of them fatal, there are an estimated <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stampoutsleepingsickness.com%2Fabout-sos-%2Fsleeping-sickness-and-nagana.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkAit60Jo-LZ7xw9VKUkH4G9pNSQ" title="">30,000-50,000 new cases of trypanosomiasis</a> reported each year, with some 48,000 deaths recorded annually. In addition, the disease is likely to be misdiagnosed as in its early stages it is often confused with malaria and in its later stages with Aids.</p><p>Trypanosomiasis is fatal when left untreated and even when it is, it has a prolonged recovery period. As a result, it can ruin lives and livelihoods. The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation says the disease probably threatens rural development and poverty alleviation in sub-Saharan Africa <a href="http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/174/4/85.full" title="">more than any other disease</a>.</p><p>Like ebola, a multidisciplinary approach to understanding trypanosomiasis is essential if it is to be controlled. Take Zambia, where trypanosomiasis has historically acted as a limitation on human settlement, with families keeping away from fertile but highly tsetse-infested areas. Land pressure is increasingly leading to colonisation of these areas. Land clearance for cash crops such as cotton is also thought to be having an effect on tsetse populations, and thus the spread of the disease.</p><p>In addition, there are likely to be social differences in vulnerability to trypanosomiasis, based on gender roles, livelihood patterns and the different ways in which people interact with their environment. These points are aside from other, 'macro' changes, such as climate change and urbanisation, which may be having an effect on tsetse ecology and disease transmission. Thus, it can easily be seen how medical research on its own is insufficient to understand and tackle the disease.</p><p>The stories behind a host of other zoonoses – from <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fmediacentre%2Ffactsheets%2Ffs207%2Fen%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEuHdf97WPr3PTwlDQPZy87w1RqzQ" title="">rift valley fever to ebola</a> – are just as complex. Only multidisciplinary research can help to reveal and unravel their complexity. Without a holistic understanding of all the inter-related factors affecting the emergence, transmission and spread of zoonoses, disease management or elimination will remain beyond our reach.</p><p><em>Naomi Marks works for the </em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.driversofdisease.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRliG9z2xPJp_3VyJR_yjGqi02JA" title=""><em>Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium</em></a><em>. </em></p><p>Read more stories like this:</p><p>• <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/may/23/dengue-fever-brazil-fifa-world-cup" title="">Football fans warned about dengue fever risk at Fifa World Cup in Brazil</a></p><p>• <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/sep/16/blinding-trachoma-ethiopia-programme" title="">Blinding trachoma: why success depends on risk taking</a></p><p>• <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jan/09/ntds-diseases-disability-prevention" title="">NTDs: disease control is about much more than drugs</a></p><p><strong>Join the community of global development professionals and experts. </strong><a href="https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/" title=""><strong>Become a GDPN member</strong></a><strong> to get more stories like this direct to your inbox</strong></p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/28/relatives-sierra-leone-ebola-patients-clinic <p>Relatives of Ebola patients in Sierra Leone have been removing their loved ones from community health centres despite protests from medical staff, amid warnings from the World Health Organisation that the deadly and highly infectious disease is still spreading across west Africa nearly two months after an outbreak was first reported.</p><p>Guinea's capital, Conakry, has recorded its first new Ebola cases in more than a month, and five people have died in Sierra Leone's first confirmed outbreak of Ebola virus, according to the WHO.</p><p>"The situation is serious, you can't say it is under control as cases are continuing and it is spreading geographically," Dr Pierre Formenty, a WHO expert who recently returned from Guinea, told a news briefing in Geneva on Wednesday.</p><p>"There was no decline. In fact it is because we are not able to capture all the outbreak that we were under the impression there was a decline," he said.</p><p>In Sierra Leone, the family of one woman said they had removed her from a clinic in Koindu town, in the country's east, because they did not trust the medical system and feared she would die if a planned transfer to the general hospital in the town of Kenema went ahead, Amara Jambai, the health ministry's director of disease prevention and control, told Reuters.</p><p>On Wednesday, Jambai told the BBC that a total of six patients had been "aggressively" removed from care in Koindu, in defiance of medical staff.</p><p>When asked about the risk posed by the woman's removal from hospital in Kenema, Jambai said: "She can infect others, her family members and also those in the community. There is no news of her condition because she has been taken away so we need to search and find her and make sure that it [Ebola] doesn't spread."</p><p>Jambai said MPs and community leaders would try to talk to family members and persuade them to return her to hospital. She said there had been no news of the woman, whose identity has been kept secret, since she was taken from Koindu to her village nearby.</p><p>In Guinea, two districts north of Conakry previously untouched by the disease confirmed outbreaks through laboratory testing, the WHO said. Twelve cases, including four deaths, were reported in Telimele and Boffa between 23 and 26 May, while suspected Ebola infections were documented in the adjacent districts of Boke and Dubreka.</p><p>Aboubacar Sidiki Diakité, who heads the Guinean government's efforts to halt the virus's spread, said the origins of all the new outbreaks had been traced back to cases in Conakry. "The problem is that there are families that refuse to give information to health workers. They hid their sick to try to treat them through traditional methods," he told Reuters.</p><p>The WHO has documented a total of 281 clinical cases of Ebola, including 185 deaths in Guinea since the virus was first identified as Ebola in March. The disease is thought to have killed 11 people in Liberia, thought there have been no new cases there since 9 April.</p><p>Ebola is endemic to Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Uganda and South Sudan. Researchers believe the west African outbreak was caused by a new strain of the virus.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/ebola-virus-outbreak-infectious-dance-tune <p>Few viruses can boast of being the inspiration for hit dance tunes. But then ebola – which can kill up to 90% of victims, has no vaccine or cure, and causes horrific internal and external bleeding – is not your average pathogen. When an epidemic struck west Africa's music-crazy nations of Guinea and Liberia, it spawned mass panic  – and the outbreak of a new dance accompanied to a infectious rap song.</p><p>"Ebola, Ebola in town. Don't touch your friend! No kissing, no eating something. It's dangerous!" warns the chorus of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shadowmrgn/ebola-in-town-d-12-shadow-kuzzy-of-2kings" title="">Ebola in Town</a>, looped over a catchy, trippy electro-dance beat. At one point, the rapper describes an attempt to escape ebola by fleeing to neighbouring Guinea only to discover, in lyrics that suggest a stalking ex-lover, the disease lurking there too. Clubbers bitten by the musical bug have come up with a "no touching" jig in roadside bars of the capital, Monrovia.</p><p>"With such a high illiteracy rate, and such important messages to get across, sometimes a catchy or humorous song is the best way. I still remember ones that were made when I was a child in school here in Liberia," said bank manager Ethel Knuckles, in her 30s.</p><p>Such musical comic relief follows in the tradition of others such as Ivory Coast's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEFOaAtB_bg&amp;feature=player_embedded#!" title="">Crazy Chicken</a> dance, inspired by the bird flu virus. Aside from comic relief, in a region with weak public health systems, the ebola song also communicates vital information needed to curb the virus, which is spread through contact with fluids of infected people or animals, like urine, blood and saliva. This week, Sierra Leone confirmed four people had died in a district that borders southern Guinea, where the outbreak began.</p><p>Health workers have raced to contain ebola's transmission. When it appeared for the first time in Guinea this March – from where it later jumped to Liberia – popular text messages claimed an antidote could be found in of a concoction of hot chocolate, coffee, milk, sugar and raw onions. In Liberia, many initially dismissed ebola as a way for health officials to rake in money. Few took <a href="http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/health-sci/1197-no-sex-liberia-s-ebola-epidemic-and-consequences" title="">official advice</a> to abstain from sex – coyly referred to as "no eating something" in the song – seriously.</p><p>Hosted by fruit bats, a local delicacy, the "molecular shark" has so far killed 145 people, around two thirds in Guinea.</p><p>"Timing and appropriate healthcare are crucial to whether ebola spreads, and whether victims survive. It needs to be taken very seriously but there's a tendency for people to develop a kind of paranoid psychosis about ebola," said Sakouba Keita of Guinea's health ministry.</p><p>For those who do beat the odds, Ebola in Town's call for "no touching" pre-empts the stigma that often awaits. Health workers say the terrified reactions towards survivors recalls the early days of the HIV epidemic, and can even affect relatives.</p><p>In Bakary's case, he went to the mosque to offer a thanksgiving prayer when his brother-in-law survived. "I was instantly left standing alone in the mosque. In broad daylight, people were treating me like a leper," the civil servant said by phone from Guinea's capital of Conakry. "My boss put me on forced sick leave and I haven't been called back yet." The family's children were pulled out of their private school after other parents told their classmates to avoid them.</p><p>An added complication is that medics on the frontline often face the greatest prejudice.</p><p>"You have to be scared of anyone who goes around dressed up like a cosmonaut," said Fanta Mamadou, a market trader in Nzérékoré, Guinea's second city, where residents initially refused to open their doors to health workers dressed head-to-toe <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/04/guinea-ebola-outbreak-sierra-leone-liberia" title="">biohazard suits</a>. Communities with little knowledge of the virus also <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/04/guinea-ebola-mali-idUSL5N0MW2AG20140404" title="">attacked a treatment clinic</a> at the epicentre of the epidemic, fearing relatives could catch the bug while being held in precautionary quarantine.</p><p>"Stigmatisation has now become the main challenge we are dealing with," said Marc Poncin, emergency co-ordinator of Doctors Without Borders, whose suspected or confirmed cases have dwindled to seven in Guinea. An epidemic is officially over once 42 days have passed with no new cases.</p><p>Medical workers make a point of accompanying recovered patients on their return home. "We always hug the patient in front of the family to show it is possible to live normally with a cured person," Poncin said.</p><p>For some survivors, being stigmatised is the least of their worries. "It feels miraculous to be given a second chance," said a former patient who gave only her first name, Rose. "The first thing on my mind when I got home was to hold my children, then give the house a good spring clean."</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/21/jean-marie-le-pen-ebola-population-explosion-europe-immigration <p>Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of France's far-right Front National, has suggested the deadly virus Ebola could solve the global "population explosion" and by extension Europe's "immigration problem".</p><p>At a cocktail party before an election rally in Marseille on Tuesday evening, days before the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/european-elections" title="">European elections</a> in which the FN is leading the polls in France, Le Pen spoke of the "demographic explosion" in the world.</p><p>"Monseigneur Ebola could sort that out in three months," he said in front of journalists.</p><p>Later, addressing supporters, Le Pen, 85, said he feared the French population risked being "replaced … by immigrants".</p><p>"In our country and in all Europe, we have known a cataclysmic phenomenon – a migratory invasion that, my friends, we are seeing only the beginning of today."</p><p>Le Pen, who is standing as MEP for the south-east seat, added: "This massive immigration risks producing a real replacement of populations if we don't arrive in power soon enough to put an end to the politics of decadence that has been followed for decades."</p><p>He said that religion added an "aggravating factor" to this problem because many immigrants were Muslim and Islam had a "conquering vocation … and even more conquering when it feels strong and they feel numerous"</p><p>S.peaking in Marseille, which elected an FN mayor in one of its districts in recent elections, Le Pen was followed on stage by his daughter, party president Marine.</p><p>Once again, her father undermined her campaign to convince voters the FN has evolved from its days as a vehicle for the extreme right and Nazi apologists.</p><p>Taking the microphone, Marine Le Pen continued with the twin pillars of the party's manifesto: the anti-immigration and anti-Europe.</p><p>"That's enough. We wish to become masters in our own home once again," she told the cheering audience.</p><p>She added that France was caught between "two steel jaws", saying: "On one side we have the importing of foreign cultures by a wave of foreigners who, unlike those who came before wish to impose a change on our behaviour and our lives. On the other side, there are the European commissioners who force their crazy administration on every aspect of our daily lives."</p><p>Opinion polls have suggested that the FN could score between 23% and 25% of the vote in France this Sunday, beating the opposition centre-right UMP party and the ruling Socialists.</p><p>Jean-Marie Le Pen has been accused and convicted several times of xenophobia and antisemitism. In February 2005 a court in Paris ruled that his remarks about Muslims in an interview with Le Monde constituted an incitement to racial hatred and he was fined €10,000 (£8,100) plus €5,000 in damages. The conviction and fines were upheld on appeal. In 1987 Le Pen said he supported the forced isolation of those infected with the HIV virus. In June 1996 he complained that the French World Cup football team contained too many non-white players.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/26/mynypd-cliven-bundy-jo-becker-failure <p>As a journalist and citizen, I have always hated public relations. I believe it to be a fraudulent type of expression, a thinly veiled propaganda tool, a mercenary, French-Foreign-Legion form of communicating. So whenever a PR campaign crashes and burns – as three did this week, more spectacularly than a Bitcoin investment in Mt Gox – I couldn’t be happier.<br /></p> <p>To recap: first, an attempt by a police department to burnish its image on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MyNYPD&amp;src=typd">resulted in even more attention</a> to its officers’ inclination to beat the shit out of the very citizens they allegedly protect.<br /></p> <p>Next, a book on same-sex marriage compared a white, &quot;<a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/04/16/jo-beckers-troubling-travesty-of-gay-history/">handsome, bespectacled thirty-five-year-old political consultant</a>&quot; to Rosa Parks on its first page, and then went on to focus almost exclusively on rich, white men.<br /></p> <p>Finally, a white, law-breaking rancher made into a beloved folk hero by conservative media and embraced by leading Republicans, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html">said &quot;the Negro&quot; is in trouble</a> because they &quot;abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton&quot;, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/24/cliven-bundy-racist-comments-defenders">forcing his defenders to back-pedal wildly</a>.</p> <p>Each campaign was waged in different ways, targeting different demographics. But each shared three common, disdainful assumptions about the sector of the American public to which it was trying to &quot;relate&quot;:</p> <ol> <li>That the public would eat whatever shit was shoveled down its throat;</li> <li>That the public would stand for the systematic exclusion of the experiences of women, people of color and the economically marginalized; and</li> <li>That the public wouldn&apos;t use social media to respond in kind.</li> </ol> <p>For instance, the New York Police Department <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/23/mynypd-twitter-call-out-new-york-police-backfires">hilariously launched the #myNYPD hashtag</a>, in the misguided, bizarre belief that smiling people would tweet happy-go-lucky photos of themselves with police officers. The genius behind this campaign seemed oblivious that such images largely exist solely in Norman Rockwell paintings (and, occasionally, in the delusional imaginations of suburban white people who’ve never met the NYPD). </p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/NYPDnews/statuses/458665477409996800">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Do you have a photo w/ a member of the NYPD?

Her book was billed as an historic account of the same-sex marriage equality fight in the United States, replete with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/magazine/how-the-president-got-to-i-do-on-same-sex-marriage.html">an excerpt in the New York Times Magazine</a>. Yet despite the gravitas of its launch, its takedown as pandering access journalism has been swift and relentless. </p> <p>Embarrassingly, Becker’s book is apparently <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/the-new-book-about-the-marriage-equality-movement">part of a PR scheme by a small group of powerful white men</a> – the &quot;handsome, bespectacled&quot; and Rosa-Parks-esque Human Rights Campaign president Chad Griffin, and lawyers David Boies and former Bush Administration Solicitor General Ted Olsen – to cast themselves as the Great White (and largely straight!) Hope, who won over a black president and brought equality to the homosexuals of a savage nation.</p> <p>Like so much PR that comes out of Gay Inc, the book just reinforces a narrative that these rights were granted and won by a few Washington insiders. It nearly ignores decades of work by women, queer activists of color, and – most glaringly – unknown legions of grassroots activists around the country, who knocked on doors and lobbied state legislators to change hearts and minds – and then tweeted in outrage once they learned who Gay Inc said &quot;really&quot; won the war .</p> <p>And, finally, let’s look at the implosion of recently-crowned conservative folk hero Cliven Bundy. For years, Rancher Bundy has, repeatedly and flagrantly, broken the law by grazing his cattle on federal land and refusing to pay the fees owed to his government. Because he fits the narrative of a white cowboy colonizing the West (and any Native Americans, Mexicans or the Bureau of Land Management agents who get in his way, be damned!), Bundy had been given a series of wet and sloppy rhetorical kisses from many conservatives, including Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.</p> <p>Bundy’s fight with the feds wasn’t a totally planned campaign. But, like John McCain embracing Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher (aka &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot;), the conservatives who rushed to embrace Bundy as an aggrieved white man with Barack Obama’s foot on his neck was a PR ploy too delicious for right-wingers to turn down. </p> <p>But as always happens whenever the establishment right embraces one of these guys, hoping their dog-whistle racism will stay stealth, it turned into a PR nightmare when their new hero start wondering aloud after ad hoc news conferences on a wooden stage on his ranch if blacks were &quot;better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy?&quot;</p> <p>Tellingly, this unholy trinity of major screw-ups in American spin showed not just that PR professionals consider the public to be morons – which they quite clearly do – but that the flacks are morons themselves. Social media is about social interaction, not just social persuasion; it is not, to the great consternation of flacks the world over, free PR that can always be controlled by a handful of powerful people.</p>

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/04/guinea-ebola-outbreak-sierra-leone-liberia <p>Late last month, villagers in Guinea's remote south-eastern region of Nzérékoré were greeted by a sight so alarming that many barricaded themselves indoors. A group of doctors dressed in protective suits and helmets were visiting the centre of an Ebola epidemic that has raged for six weeks.</p><p>"People were running away from the doctors who looked like cosmonauts on their way back from the moon. We have never seen anything like it. Some locked their doors, others hid themselves. It was frightening because there were all kinds of rumours about how this disease was spreading," said Bah Mamadou, a taxi driver.</p><p>It took two more days before his neighbours began to open their doors. Such reactions highlight the uphill battle facing officials and medics as they attempt to contain one of the world's rarest and most lethal viruses, which has claimed 84 lives in the outbreak and jumped borders to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Mali.</p><p>International organisations fear it could sweep across a region with weak public health services. "Prevention is the only way to contain the Ebola spread and we are desperately trying to get the message across. Posters, leaflets, radio, text messages and TV spots – we are resorting to every possible method to reach communities far and wide," said Berenger Berehoudougou, west Africa director of the aid organisation Plan International.</p><p>Officials from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention travelled to Guinea this week to offer help, after a scare in Canada when a citizen returning from Liberia fell ill and was initially thought to have been infected.</p><p>There have been five suspected Ebola fatalities in Sierra Leone. In Liberia, where a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/31/guinea-ebola-epidemic-medecins-sans-frontieres" title="">state of emergency has closed the border with Guinea</a>, the government said this week that the latest of its nine victims had no known links to Guinea. "We have a case in Tapeta where a hunter who has not had any contact with anyone coming from Guinea got sick," the chief medical officer, Bernice Dahn, told AFP. "He was rushed to the hospital and died 30 minutes later. He never had any interaction with someone suspected to be a carrier of the virus and he has never gone to Guinea. This an a isolated case."</p><p>Described by virologists as a "molecular shark", Ebola is passed on through bodily fluids and causes extensive internal and external bleeding. The fruit bat, a delicacy in Guinea and Liberia, is a host of the virus. The World Health Organisation believes that the virus spread from Guinea's forested regions to the densely populated capital, Conakry, through one man who travelled 200 miles from the central town of Dobala.</p><p>"Unfortunately, this one person infected both family members and healthcare workers when he went to Conakry for medical attention and died," said a WHO spokesman, Gregory Hartl. Six of the man's relatives and two other people exposed to him are being kept in isolation at a hospital.</p><p>Already struggling with a measles epidemic that has infected 1,500 people since November, Guinea's health system – which ranked last in a 2011 World Bank study of beds per capita – has struggled to cope with the outbreak. Although Guinea is the world's top exporter of bauxite, mineral riches have failed to translate into prosperity. The government – recovering from almost five decades of dictatorship – took more than a month to identify the epidemic, which appeared in early February. The Brazilian mining firm <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/02/us-guinea-ebola-idUSBREA3125920140402" title="">Vale</a> has pulled its international staff from the country.</p><p>The latest infections have been passed on among family members or carers, said Sakouba Keita, a health ministry official. In one case, 10 people in one family died. "A lot of people are fleeing towns once they have any sign of a fever or headache. That's where we are psychologically today."</p><p>He said the government had a list of affected families and was placing them under 21 days' quarantine. "We also have to deal with a situation where people are using very crowded public transport from the interior to reach hospitals here. We're trying to make sure everybody hears the basic steps they can take to prevent the situation escalating," Keita said. Plan International said a co-ordinated multicountry emergency response was needed.</p><p>Last week the Senegalese music star Youssou N'Dour cancelled a concert in Conakry, fearing that a large crowd could spread the disease. Senegal's borders remain closed. Moussa Cissé, a rice trader in Senegal's southern town of Kédougou, said: "It has made things a bit difficult for us here because the weekly markets in [frontier towns] have completely shut down. People are just staying at home and trying to make ends meet."</p><p>Other countries have put in place preventive measures. Morocco has implemented strict travel controls, and Saudi Arabia has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/01/saudi-arabia-visas-guinea-liberia-ebola" title="">suspended visas</a> for an estimated 10,000 Muslim pilgrims from Guinea and Liberia. Dauda Souaré, who organises Mecca pilgrimages from Conakry, said: "It's really a massive disappointment to be placed under this kind of collective measure."</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/01/guinea-ebola-outbreak-whats-being-done-explained <p>The medical aid charity Médecins sans Frontières <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/31/guinea-ebola-epidemic-medecins-sans-frontieres">warned this week</a> that Guinea faces an Ebola epidemic “of a magnitude never before seen” as the nation’s president appealed for calm amid a rising death toll. </p> <p>Since January, Guinea health authorities have reported more than 150 suspected cases and nearly 80 deaths, scattered far across the country. The outbreak has led to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/01/saudi-arabia-visas-guinea-liberia-ebola">travel alerts</a> and thrust one of the world’s most lethal infectious diseases back into the spotlight.</p> <h2>What is Ebola?</h2> <p>&quot;One of the most virulent viral diseases known to humankind&quot;, reads the WHO&apos;s alarming <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/en/">first sentence on Ebola</a>, the group of five viruses with a case fatality ranging from <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/">25-90%</a> in humans. Ebola infects humans through direct contact with a sick person&apos;s (or animal&apos;s) blood or bodily fluids, or through contact with contaminated objects (such as needles and bedsheets). A &quot;viral haemorrhagic fever&quot;, symptoms at first resemble those of a normal fever, infections spread quickly among family and friends caring for sick people, and then among medical staff who haven&apos;t confirmed the cause of sickness.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the disease shares early symptoms with any number of other other illnesses, ranging from a passing fever to malaria, cholera and meningitis. Between two and 21 days, infected people might have red eyes and a rash, or <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/symptoms/index.html">suddenly experience</a> &quot;onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and sore throat&quot;, &quot;followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding&quot;. </p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-1b033f75-7695-4733-91a4-75d7c0eca754"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/31/1396306285776/60418571-36b6-40c1-ab15-bfc1729a0a76-460x276.jpeg" alt="Ebola" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">The Ebola virus.

Ebola <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/diagnosis/index.html">requires lab tests </a>to confirm, and usually appears around tropical rainforests.</p> <h2>Where is it?</h2> <p>Guinea, the west African country with a sliver of land reaching the Atlantic, is the broad center of March&apos;s outbreak. On 23 March, authorities <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/23/guinea-ebola-outbreak-conakry">confirmed infections nationwide</a>, from rural, southern towns to its capital, the port city of Conakry, where over two million people live. As doctors must quarantine the sick with extreme precaution, the wide range of infections could be disastrous. As of Monday, there have been 78 deaths from 122 suspected cases since January; the nation&apos;s health ministry has confirmed 22 of those deaths as due to Ebola. It took six weeks for the ministry to confirm Ebola since suspected cases first appeared.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-f91fe260-c733-441c-8ff9-0aa73f1bf387"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/31/1396302247408/48cbc693-7c92-4459-8698-b7fb16405ae5-460x276.png" alt="guinea google maps" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">There has only been one other reported outbreak of Ebola in west Africa, in Ivory Coast in 1994.

Careful, standard practices – washing hands, wearing masks and gloves, clean gowns and safe injections – can mean the difference between life and death.</p> <p>Medical staff must often wear full-body protection when helping the sick, who may be placed in containment tents. Preventing further infection may also mean culling and burning infected animals, restricting movement from towns and quickly burying the dead. In short, everything possible is done to reduce and limit contact between infected people and animals. Doctors&apos; can treat infections that would complicate patient&apos;s condition, but they are otherwise limited to helping sick people stay <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/treatment/index.html">hydrated and breathe healthily</a>.

The CDC has issued<a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/ebola-guinea"> a travel alert</a> for Guinea, and the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/30/guinea-battles-spread-ebola-virus">EU pledged €500,000 </a>to fight the highly contagious disease.</p> <h2>Where did Ebola come from?</h2> <p>In 1976, the first known incidents of the disease broke out in two places simultaneously: one in Nzara, Sudan, and the other in the village of Yambuku, near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Where the disease survives between outbreaks, called its &quot;reservoir&quot;,<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/exposure/index.html"> is not known</a>, though fruit bats are a suspected &quot;natural host&quot;. Humans have contracted the disease through contact with chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, pigs, bats and other mammals, especially those found dead.</p> <p>Ebola has periodically broken out in remote villages, all in Africa, with outbreaks in the DRC and Uganda as recently as 2012, and with death tolls reaching 187 in the DRC in 2007 and 224 in Uganda in 2000. Monkeys, imported to the US from the Philippines in the 1990s, were found to have a similar species of virus, and though several people were infected, none fell ill. (The dangers of a virus like Ebola were explored in the 1995 film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak_(film)">Outbreak</a>, in which an infected monkey is set loose in America.)</p> <p> In labs in England and Russia there have been <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/exposure/index.html">three total cases </a>of contamination causing illness. </p>
